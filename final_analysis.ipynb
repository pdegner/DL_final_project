      "label: 1 text: it's not exactly a matter of anticipated use~ because given what i've seen~ i think the \"correct\" advice is to not use rigid stem cams  without tie-off loops in horizontal placements unless you can get the cam in far enough so that the stem-end hole is close (say within an inch) to the rock face\n",

      "label: 0 text: during this scientific testing~ all the cams blew except totem\n",
      "label: 1 text: did you try to pull single stem cams out of your crack simulator?   have you thought about gluing some stone tiles to the inside of your simulator to get a better approximation? i would guess that the shape and deformations of the crack are a major factor\n",

      "label: 2 text: and tri cams rule in this type of placement\n",
      "label: 1 text: probably not new information for those who have lived and breathed the technicalities of cams but that is probably a minority\n",
      "label: 0 text: given that close to half my placements of cams are horizontal placements~ i'm not too fussed\n",
      "label: 0 text: the fact is; cams are not the best option for horizontal placements\n",
      "label: 1 text: if all you have is cams~ then doubling it up and equalizing it is your best option.\n",
      "label: 1 text: none of the original analysis applies to totem cams~ by the way~ because the stem is not the mechanism that transmits load to the lobes~ rather the lobes are directly loaded by wires that run up the \"back side\" of the lobe\n",
      "label: 1 text: so in addition to the recommendations above~ using totem cams for shallow horizontal placements is the way to go\n",
      "label: 1 text: for example~ metolius makes fat cams for sandstone even though the theory says that surface area contact doesn't matter~ and various manufacturers~ most especially now dmm~ texturize the cam lobes in an attempt to increase \"friction~\" whatever that really is\n",
      "label: 1 text: i think we both agree that it's still a useful starting point for understanding how cams work (understanding why they hold in flares~ for instance) while recognizing that reality is more complex than the models.\n",
      "label: 1 text: so what we've learned today is that cams work in some small part due to physics and mostly due to voodoo.\n",
      "label: 1 text: just curious if the rotation of the lobes in the double-axle cams as the stem angle changes is actually changing the camming angle of the individual lobes~ and if so~ what impact that has on the overall camming angle?    does it stay constant as both lobes rotate with stem position? or does the rotation of the lobes not effect the camming angle?   i would expect this was taken into account with the design of double-axle cams~ but i've never seen the lobe rotation visualized this way before.\n",
      "label: 1 text: i think it's cool you made the video and started a conversation about horizontally placed cams holding but..\n",
      "label: 2 text: gunks pro placements are typically horizontals and there is strong anecdotal evidence that cams have been holding falls for years in the gunks\n",
      "label: 2 text: also even the smoothest cracks still have undulations that are going to help engage the cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: we were out in the gunks today and decided to put a few cams in some of the worst case situations\n",
      "label: 1 text: nothing about not placing cams in horizontals~ just to inspect the steam if you fall on it because it \"might\" get damaged.\n",
      "label: 2 text: i repeated with single stem metolius master cams (the new ones) and they were solid from all directions of pull\n",
      "label: 0 text: chris~ i'm not personally concerned about cams in horizontals~ although the math still interesting\n",
      "label: 0 text: i never trust horizontal cams in a perfectly parallel crack\n",
      "label: 1 text: where i live i normally go for tri-cams over normal cams for horizontals anyway\n",
      "label: 1 text: your gear looks like it is poping from not so much a fall but the fact that the pull is causing the cam to turn~ no different than a bad placement where your cams aren't even pushing into the wall\n",
      "label: 1 text: for the horizontals the options i had happened to be shallow~ so i only opted to do this with two cams as i was concerned of stem bending and possible damage\n",
      "label: 2 text: both cams held~ which was very inspiring~ although as i predicted the c4 stem bent quite a bit\n",
      "label: 0 text: wire stems of cams will eventually break with repeated off axis falls\n",
      "label: 1 text: the fact is that cams do sometimes fail and afterwards we aren't sure why~ and then in other cases they hold when everything we know about them suggests they shouldn't\n",
      "label: 0 text: if this were an issue that had caused cams to blow~ even once~ it would be worth discussing\n",
      "label: 0 text: also when cams are placed in horizontals aren't the outer lobes supposed to be on the bottom.\n",
      "label: 1 text: there are several known ways for cams to fail~ and reiterating those isn't what this topic was about\n",
      "label: 1 text: had this been title \"what causes cams to fail?\" there would have been far more interesting discussion and anecdotal examples put forth by people worth listening to\n",
      "label: 1 text: the fact of the matter is that this wasn't an investigation into why cams fail~ a noble but known topic\n",
      "label: 1 text: yes cams have failed~ we have all seen the videos~ we've likely all had it happen and for the most part we know why it happens\n",
      "label: 1 text: but until good  placements start  rocketing out of horizontals after moderate~ or even large falls~ this type of pseudoscience should not assert that well placed cams in horizontal cracks are going to fail.\n",
      "label: 1 text: maybe the op can weigh in~ but he only questioned if the cam would hold~ then proceeded to climb carbs~ fall~ and then no cams ripped\n",
      "label: 1 text: then i´d consider whether in a nearly tipped-out cam the lower lobe opens to the cam stop and the whole thing slides out because on my twin-axle cams the stiffness of the wire is about as strong as the cam springs themselves\n",

      "label: 1 text: in short~ the customer service replied back and essentially said that it is nothing to worry about and that i could buy the cams and could get them re-slung for a small price by black diamond\n",
      "label: 1 text: that said~ make an offer to take the older cams of their hands.\n",
      "label: 1 text: i would bet a large amount of money you could pull test those cams and they would fail above their rating\n",
      "label: 1 text: the rating of bd's larger cams is 14kn~ with the maincable being the weak point\n",
      "label: 1 text: i dont know what the strength rating of the sling itself is~ but i can tell you bd uses the exact same webbing (same thickness and weight) to make their 2' slings and those slings are rated for 22kn so it would stand to reason the slings on the cams would hold 22kn as well\n",
      "label: 1 text: however~ if they were made in 2011 and it's been sitting in the store for five years~ that tells you that store cant sell cams for crap which gives you a bit of an upper hand in negotiating\n",
      "label: 1 text: black diamond recommends re-slinging cams every 5-8 years for occasional use\n",
      "label: 1 text: man~ some of my cams on my creek rack are over 20 years old~ and none are less than 3\n",
      "label: 2 text: i mentioned i have cams that are older that i need to re sling~ but if u are paranoid about it it is an option.\n",
      "label: 2 text: you could have all your cams sent away to be re-slung and still have a good deal\n",
      "label: 2 text: great deal~ and those cams are old enough that you should get them reslung\n",
      "label: 0 text: re-sling the cams and toss anything that is soft~ (but i am really picky about my gear).\n",
      "label: 2 text: definitely replace the cord on the hexes and get the cams re-slung\n",
      "label: 1 text: help out this  fellow climber  by sending your cams to get re-slung for good prices.\n",
      "label: 2 text: the number 5 drops in weight a lot compared to the mid-sizes (which i am not planning on getting because metolius ultralight cams are a comparable weight)\n",
      "label: 1 text: he prefers them to the larger cams due to weight~ price and stability.\n",
      "label: 2 text: i only buy jewel tone cams.\n",

      "label: 1 text: this time i have a double rack instead of the 5 cams~ set of nuts and hexes that i could scrounge together for my first trip\n",
      "label: 0 text: it is a great pack that will withstand much abuse such as dropping in on the ground repeatedly with cams poking into the side and bottom\n",
      "label: 2 text: could easily store all those big cams you need for veda~ and then some.\n",
      "label: 2 text: regarding the totem cams that can hold well on 2 lobes (ie~ not the totem basics)~ which of the cam sizes do you most prefer and importantly~ why?  i was told green~ but after testing it~ not so sure\n",
      "label: 0 text: they do hold better than almost all cams (with the possible exception of splitter cams) on 2 lobes~ but i'm not sure that should be the overriding concern\n",
      "label: 2 text: there are offset cams available in the smaller sizes for dealing with flares~ but now & then you encounter a larger pod that regular cams won't fit as well\n",
      "label: 1 text: i see a bigger difference between the totems and the master cams~ in the smaller sizes\n",

      "label: 1 text: a full set of cams.\n",

      "label: 1 text: get stoppers and piece mail together cams as you need them\n",
      "label: 1 text: with these sorts of routes you should be able to find out exactly what cams are needed either listed in the pro or in the comments\n",

      "label: 1 text: set of cams and nuts\n",
      "label: 1 text: hmm you might honestly start with mid size cams #1-2~ then expand out ( .75~ .5~ 3 in that order)\n",
      "label: 0 text: with cams~ you could continue using regular sport draws most of the time~ and i highly doubt that you would need doubles for a mixed route~ considering half the placements will be bolts...\n",
      "label: 1 text: (if the placements were shallow~ tricky~ unusually small or unusually large~ there'd probably be a bolt.)  this does suggest mid-range cams are also a good choice\n",
      "label: 2 text: i could be wrong on the cams most useful in your area but i would guess you want to get bd .5 and .75 and always bring them with you\n",
      "label: 1 text: get smaller and bigger bd cams when / if you need them\n",
      "label: 1 text: do you like dmm cams in the larger sizes? seems to me the larger/ heavier/ top heavy/ the cam is~ the more i'd want the thumb loop\n",
      "label: 1 text: in fact~ a few of the wc cams have this \"fill the gap\" effect with bd cams~ such at the #2 fitting between the .75 and #1 bd\n",
      "label: 1 text: if i had the $$$ when building my rack when i started i would have chosen dmm cams (and biners...) over bd gear which feels clunky and loose in comparison.\n",

      "label: 1 text: or check the forum for some cheap used cams~ buy one and remove the trigger bar...just a thought.\n",

      "label: 0 text: that was my largest complaint with the dragon cams from dmm\n",
      "label: 2 text: a shame~ since i do like the master cams quite a bit.\n",
      "label: 1 text: who buys cams without thumb loops? sure~ dragon cams~ but those are far inferior to c4s~ according to the masses (and me)\n",
      "label: 1 text: i like the removal of the thumb loop because to me thumb loops seem to be the weak point in the cams\n",
      "label: 2 text: i think the new metolius cams are more refined and overall i feel will be an advancement upon the original mastercam\n",
      "label: 1 text: i don't need anymore cams right now but i may pick some up to try them out.\n",
      "label: 1 text: so much for me preferring mastercams for small cams~ totem really needs to get their production figured out with the basics\n",
      "label: 2 text: i've used older camalots with the thumb stop~ and omega cams~ and they don't seem as comfortable to place\n",
      "label: 0 text: totem cams are longer over all than the current master cam unless your clipping to only one side of the totem~ in that case its a bit shorter\n",
      "label: 2 text: as far as aiding nobody complains about the totem length so the new master cams will probably be just fine\n",
      "label: 1 text: i was on the fence about doubling my bd stuff~ and now i'll diversify~ going for these master cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: theres plenty of placements where you might use a quickdraw~ but extend the sling on those cams instead around here   theres also plenty of placement where you might not have extended because you wanted to save draws~ but you may with those cams   they arent any substitute for an alpine draw~ but for short extensions they work fine ..\n",
      "label: 2 text: however on extendible thumb loop cams the extended loop can pinch pretty aggressively on the thumb loop leading to kinking for the loop   it will be interesting to see if the new mastercams are shorter than the old ones~ and if they are actually less \"flexible\" or more so ..\n",
      "label: 1 text: metolius already have some of the shortest cams on the market~ their tcus and powercams   ;)\n",
      "label: 1 text: just a note on metolius customer service when sending in cams to have trigger wires (kevlar cord) replaced\n",
      "label: 2 text: i tried to explain to him that is what the cams are for and how metolius will not stand behind their cam\n",
      "label: 1 text: a little customer service goes a long ways; especially as many cams and other gear i have bought & used from metolius in the past\n",
      "label: 1 text: that's what the damn cams are for! if they can't withstand regular use of a cam~ they shouldn't be selling it\n",
      "label: 1 text: i can't afford to replace my cams after each fall.\n",
      "label: 1 text: metolius cams don't have extendable slings\n",
      "label: 1 text: because they went to kevlar on all their cams~ i think this discussion is very relevant\n",
      "label: 0 text: also the lack of the thumb loop - they don't want you to aid on their cams i guess\n",
      "label: 1 text: is this really such a huge issue? i would think that the weight reduction would be amazing for aid climbers since they're bringing doubles or  triples of most cams plus doubles off-set cams etc\n",
      "label: 0 text: if they resling beat up cams that are still in service that extends them into unsafe territory\n",
      "label: 1 text: all of my experiences with metolius customer service and with sending cams back to be fixed or re-slung have been awesome\n",
      "label: 2 text: i look forward to checking out the new cams!\n",
      "label: 0 text: personally~ i felt that old master cams hung very long off my harness\n",
      "label: 1 text: if the loop solution makes them lighter and not hang as far~ i will take it!   as to thumb loops being important for plugging cams on hard routes~ i have never found that to be a limiting factor; i think it is a barely fractional complaint for those people that simply like the design: counter points= u stem cams~ forged friends~ old camalots..\n",
      "label: 0 text: i don't think it makes placing cams any easier\n",
      "label: 1 text: when i talked to metolius in early april they said the new cams will be out starting july/aug~ though it could take longer for your local store to get them in--i'm not sure which distributors will get priority\n",
      "label: 1 text: the offset ul master cams will be updated afterwards~ possibly out by the end of the year\n",
      "label: 1 text: i'm sure that will partly depend on demand for the new cams as well\n",
      "label: 1 text: i was under the impression that the patents had expired on the alien design though~ so whats stopping the major companies from emulating it? dmm came out with the dragon cams soon after the bd patents expired a couple years ago\n",
      "label: 1 text: looks like some of the new metolius cams are in stock at backcountry\n",
      "label: 1 text: that is really unfortunately as they are among my favourite micro cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: do you know if they will be replacing them with another line of micro cams? i will be very sad if they don't as they are by far my favorite micro cams.\n",
      "label: 0 text: black diamond has stated that you cannot resling their cams with dyneema slings as it will seriously pinch and cut the maincable\n",
      "label: 1 text: that got me to thinking~ why do camalots have this issue but no other cam does? the maincable is almost identical on the new wc helium friends~ the aliens (new and old)~ totem basics~ master cams~ tcus~ and a dozen other cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: i suspect the other brands cables are just as \"tweakable\" but not a major issue as it's rare for people to truly whip on their cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: cable around the thumb loop on the c4 is simply thinner than other comparable cams~ since it's doubled over around the stem & terminated at the head\n",
      "label: 0 text: other cams (including the x4) use the same gauge cable thru out so it's less of an issue\n",
      "label: 1 text: the new bd cams made in usa are a much deeper richer color across the line.\n",
      "label: 2 text: big cams are much preferred~ but there comes a point where you need something bigger~ and bb are cheaper and more widely available than valley giants.\n",
      "label: 1 text: that said~ thoughts:   they rack well for the size they protect   relatively light   relatively cheap (for the size they protect   difficult to place (compared to cams   can't walk them with you   if not placed well....well~ umm..\n",
      "label: 1 text: they work well on roofs as a rope guide also and help protect big cams from the rope\n",
      "label: 2 text: not as quick as the big cams~ but weigh a lot less~ those 2 bb are easier to pack around than just one of the big cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: one of things you might consider is:    what cams are on (or will be on) your partners rack?    if you buy a rack that is not very common~ or buy a variety of different manufacturers cams over time~ then that is what you will learn\n",
      "label: 0 text: for this reason~ in my view~ the decision of what rack you purchase involves more than simply the quality of the cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: bd cams .5-3 doubles on 1-3    metolius power cams or master cams 1-5   metolius  tcu 0-3    set of nuts   8 -10 alpine draws    4-6 locking biners   7mm cord for anchor building   sewn slings    later you can add more gear as you climb more and will see what you need\n",
      "label: 1 text: please learn from an experienced climber on proper use of cams if you don't have   a lot of experience\n",
      "label: 1 text: a sort of \"standard rack\" is a set of nuts and a set of cams plus doubles of that (or a part of that) - depending on the climb - with lots of things perhaps added on\n",
      "label: 1 text: add dmm peanuts and offsets later if needed for doubles   cams: doubles c4s .75-4\n",
      "label: 1 text: personally when climbing on granite i prefer to have aliens in the small cams up to 1\"\n",
      "label: 2 text: on soft sandstone i would rather have cams with more surface area on the small cams like camalots or metolius fat cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: doubles in aliens:   green alien - grey alien or red alien   doubles in camalots:   .5 or .75-#3   single:   #4 camalot   blue alien~ or purple metolius   a set of small to medium size tri cams and a large hex or 2 for light weight easy alpine climbs.\n",
      "label: 1 text: however~ there's a reason camalots are typically seen as the baseline/gold standard for cams~ and i would have been better off buying them initially than \"saving\" a couple bucks buying something else cause it was cheaper\n",
      "label: 2 text: it's way cheaper and is also what i did since i couldn't afford cams at first\n",
      "label: 1 text: if you can take your time a bit (especially on cams) it's absolutely right~ unless you have more money than you know what to do with\n",
      "label: 1 text: it's a lot of cash unless you plan to drop 2-3k right off the bat between all the cams~ biners~ slings~ passive pro etc\n",
      "label: 2 text: if i was going to start a rack from scratch right now i would go with the new metolius ultralight master cams\n",
      "label: 2 text: blog.weighmyrack.com/metoli…   they are lighter than the new bd cams and have what has been called a \"floating axle\" feature for better placements in horizontals\n",
      "label: 2 text: doubles up to a number 4 camalot size will give you a versatile rack of cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: single set black diamond nuts from #4-#13   single set of black diamond cams from .5-3   also anyone that tells you not to buy shoddy used gear just wants it for themselves\n",

      "label: 1 text: i personally would recommend full cams from 1 to 8 metolius or .3-3 bd (or 4 if you have the money)\n",
      "label: 1 text: don't buy cams smaller than that to start with\n",
      "label: 1 text: everybody's got an opinion on cams~ nuts etc~ but a lot of that boils down to what works for you~ rock type and preferred style\n",
      "label: 1 text: that being said~ if you are intent on buying gear (we all get the itch):   i agree with the general sentiment of the thread: bd cams are versatile so get a set from 0.3-3 for sure (maybe #4~ check the routes in your area)\n",
      "label: 2 text: i agree on the earlier statement about nuts~ i tend to place cams when possible and if it's not that typically means there is a flare and it's perfect for dmm offsets\n",
      "label: 1 text: this goes for racking biners on your cams also (color match)~ don't get neutrinos just because that's what the guy at rei says\n",
      "label: 1 text: rack wise if i could talk to my past self i would say~ in this order over a period of time:   - set of dmm wallnuts + regular totem cams   - bd c4 sizes 2+3   - pink or red tricam~ depending on mood   - dmm allow offsets\n",
      "label: 1 text: single set totem cams(not basics) blue-red<--totems are awesome\n",

      "label: 0 text: metolius makes an all black line of cams for the military.\n",
      "label: 1 text: when you guys clip fixed gear~ specifically fixed cams~ do you clip the sling? or do you clip the thumbloop/wire?   it makes more sense to me to clip the thumbloop~ as it will not as readily deteriorate as the nylon sling will.\n",

      "label: 1 text: lots or progress this week thanks to the babysitter being out of town (and me being home instead of working)~ and it looks like i have the combined/generalized program working (previously had separate programs for single and double axle cams)\n",

      "label: 1 text: a complete 360 degree spiral like the super cam~ and a hook that can flip everything around to hook behind flakes like that flake grabbing thing that guy cobbled together~ but only have one set of cams on the outside\n",
      "label: 1 text: it's the same principle as the max cams (only one pair is offset) and totem cams (all lobes get an offset loading)\n",
      "label: 1 text: which brought me back to the belief that extended range cams are a dead end evolutionarily~ as they're too wide on the small end and too narrow on the big end\n",
      "label: 0 text: with regular cams it is only a function of the location where the trigger wires attach to the lobes\n",
      "label: 1 text: i wonder what would be the activation force on that guy~ with the larger cams needing stronger springs\n",
      "label: 1 text: so~ for me~ anything other than symmetrically deploying cams is a non-starter\n",
      "label: 1 text: (they are light and have great range as i'm sure previously mentioned in this thread)   i think the bottom line to make an advancement on large cams is stability (when placed) and cutting down weight of the unit ..\n",

      "label: 1 text: yep but i didn't have the money to replace 30 some odd carabiners that were already on cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: well~ the neutrinos are stupid light compared to the spirits i used to rack cams on\n",
      "label: 1 text: and unless you are in a pure splitter for 200 feet leave some cams on your partners harness and place nuts.\n",
      "label: 2 text: as for the op~ i don't see much reason to look past neutrinos for your cams\n",

      "label: 2 text: both cams were undamaged and the rock did not blow out\n",
      "label: 1 text: however~ i am confused because both cams initially held my weight\n",
      "label: 1 text: my question is has anyone else experienced cams sliding out of cracks and are any other makes of cams less likely to behave this way? maybe someone who knows more about physics can give a more detailed explanation of why this happened\n",
      "label: 1 text: see figure 4 vainokodas.com/climbing/cam…   \"physically~ this means that in a parallel crack~ the coefficient of friction between the rock and the cams must be larger than µ or the cams will slide down the wall and the device will pull out of the crack\n",
      "label: 0 text: on the other hand~ if µ is made too small~ the range of the cams will not be very great~ and the following forces will all increase: the compression force on the cams~ the outward force on the walls~ and the shear forces on the axle\n",
      "label: 1 text: those totem cams might be a good way to go for slicker rock~ the lobes do have some diagonal knurling but nothing like some of the other manufacturers out there\n",
      "label: 1 text: in slick rock don't use cams with large cam angles like bd\n",

      "label: 2 text: totem cams are supposed to be better in smooth rock than anything else\n",
      "label: 1 text: the cams you had were probably marginal relative to the available friction\n",
      "label: 1 text: the idea would be to just have the cams stay in place~ not to increase their range of placement\n",
      "label: 2 text: \"the teeth are cosmetic only\"   also a .3 has very little expansion range~ a slight movement can easy be a millimeter or so.this amy explain the initial hold of these cams   i am almost positive that original friends~ made in uk were tested on limestone and maybe slate  ~ but remember this is when a #1 was the smallest\n",
      "label: 1 text: i have had cams in seemingly perfect placements pull on me with nothing more than a tug\n",
      "label: 1 text: since neither the cam nor the rock broke here~ it points out quite clearly that there are some idealizations in the theory of cams that don't hold up in practice\n",
      "label: 1 text: this isn't really about breaking cams or rock~ but rather an important limitation of our understanding of cams\n",

      "label: 1 text: think of it this way~ instead of having a rack of c4's and c3's with doubles in metolius/fixe/totem/wild country for the small sizes(to cover gaps~ yadda yadda yadda)~ you could get a set of black diamond cams that compliment your c3's\n",

      "label: 1 text: if these six sizes are the only offerings~ then that leaves you with 000 through 0 (arguably the new red size is the same size as the green c3) that you have to cover with another cam- which people already do with either c3s or aliens~ or master cams~ or tcus or something else\n",
      "label: 1 text: as for the the largest four of this set~ basically they're targeting new climbers (or climbers with no or small racks) without double axle~ four lobe~ flexible stemmed cams~ right?  they would almost have to be~ because me and everyone i know that has a rack~ already has doubles or triples in almost all of these sizes~ and the vast majority are black diamond\n",
      "label: 1 text: hoping that new and shiny from a proven powerhouse in the cam manufacturing market will appeal?    now~ having said that~ and doubting a proven expert in manufacturing~ design~ and marketing field of active pro (an area i might add that i have zero experience in)~ they do look like very nice cams.\n",
      "label: 1 text: according to bearbreeder~ smaller cams have metal triggers...\n",
      "label: 1 text: personally~ in smaller sized cams~ i'd much rather have more small cams on single axles\n",
      "label: 1 text: curious as to the actual range of these cams based on the video\n",
      "label: 1 text: the master cams range from 8mm-48mm across with 8 cams (#00-#6)   fixe aliens range from 8-33 for the 6 available cams (black-red) and if you add in gold and orange you get 8-40mm\n",
      "label: 1 text: i wonder how useful the stacked axle design could really be at 8mm so i'm guessing the low end of range is closer to 11mm and they are making the blue-purple alien comparison (10mm-50mm) by the \"same range as 8 of the competition's cams with only 6 cams\" statement\n",
      "label: 2 text: i love my master cams and metolius tcu's (i bought them at a time when aliens were unavailable) and my only gripe is how they deform~ kink~ and bend after you whip on them\n",

      "label: 0 text: i've also heard of cams being sent to cch for testing and coming back with seemingly new stems using the old sling~ tubing~ axle~ trigger and lobes with no mention of there having been a problem or failure~ but again i've not seen it in person and don't personally know the person who made the post\n",
      "label: 1 text: sending cch my 5 year old'ish cams for them to do pull testing doesn't make me feel any better~ i guess because in essence you are asking the manufacturing company that you don't totally trust~ to check their own work\n",

      "label: 1 text: to another point if this is all a quality control issue then theoretically many cch cams are good and many could be bad~ but if i have individually tested all of mine by falling on them multiple times then theoretically they should be good as long as i don't apply a force greater than what i have already applied\n",
      "label: 0 text: who cares if their quality control was better when the design itself is defective? kong cams were even worse but they still turn up on racks\n",

      "label: 2 text: for me~ the range increase over master cams (especially that crappy orange) is noticeable and makes the x4s easier to place\n",
      "label: 1 text: true their are many factors that play into a cams ability (or inability) to walk but unless you are suggesting the actual spring tension is much greater around this range of max retraction~ i don't think the issue being discussed affects the cam's walking ability.\n",

      "label: 1 text: to the point made above regarding increased length over the c4's:     pull the trigger on both cams and look at them\n",
      "label: 1 text: the longer stem in the heliums just results in more stem sticking out of the crack than on a c4~ but the cams are likely contacting the rock at the same depth\n",

      "label: 0 text: dragon cam thumbpiece vs bd camalot thumbpiece   another problem most people had with the dragon cams' lack of a thumb loop was the inability to clip high while aid climbing\n",
      "label: 1 text: one point that dmm says really shines in their cams is the extendable sling\n",
      "label: 1 text: i found that on climbs that don't wander that much~ this is a savior of weight~ i only had to carry draws for my cams that weren't dragons\n",
      "label: 2 text: like i previously said~ i tried these cams out in both sandstone and granite\n",
      "label: 2 text: in my opinion~ the dragon cams felt more bomber than the camalots in granite~ but were a little sketchy in sandstone\n",
      "label: 1 text: as most know~ in sandstone the rock gives a lot more than granite~ and the greater outward force of the cams creates a shifting sound of the rock when the cams are weight/fell on\n",
      "label: 2 text: a comparable situation would be metolius's line of cams~ which have a similar camming angle~ and i've found do almost the exact same thing in sandstone\n",
      "label: 0 text: that said~ i didn't have any of the cams fail when fallen on (however~ the falls weren't that large)\n",
      "label: 1 text: due to the smaller camming angle~ the range of the dragon cams is slightly less\n",
      "label: 1 text: while dragon cams do weigh less than the c4s~ the weight is not much less~ and with a full rack it's hardly noticable\n",
      "label: 1 text: price will be an issue~ but if you're willing to shell out dragon cams will serve you well\n",
      "label: 1 text: so my recommendation for someone who was looking to save money but still have a quality rack would be c4s up to #2 and then dragon cams (until you get to sizes larger than dmm makes)   ps-sorry for the lack of pictures while actually climbing~ i didn't bring my camera out\n",

      "label: 2 text: i was actually saying that they are harder to place than other cheaper~ nearly identical cams\n",
      "label: 2 text: i find that the metal thumb stud is a step backwards from the coated thumb loop on most modern cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: (i just realized the irony of my stance here~ i'm advocating bd cams because they're cheaper; that's not something i ever thought would happen.)   yes~ manlove..\n",
      "label: 1 text: i've stated this before somewhere but i own but 2 sets of c4's (not to mention previous versions going back to v.1) and 1 set of dragon cams\n",
      "label: 2 text: i love c4's and for the larger (.5 - 4) sizes they tend to be my go to cams\n",
      "label: 2 text: i bought a set of dragon cams last year and have used them a fair amount both front and back country\n",
      "label: 1 text: obviously~ dmm designed these cams to accept whatever loads are anticipated~ so structurally there is no difference~ the cam just may not work as well in some sandstone or other soft rock\n",
      "label: 1 text: even that is debatable~ the round edge would gradually spread the force across the lobe essentially radiating load into the the stone and (this is without any calculations~ just thinking mechanically about the design) possibly reducing peak impact force in a way that flat lobed cams do not\n",
      "label: 1 text: in reality if you're that concerned about the quality of rock you should either a) run that shit out~ or b) buy some fat cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: what it comes down to is whether or not you want lighter cams~ with no thumbloop~ and dyneema slings~ or~ heavier~ with thumb loops~ and fatty slings\n",
      "label: 2 text: i've not broken a single wire on them whereas i have broken a couple of the camalot wires and the cams are in much better shape than the camalots (which seem to be made of a much less durable metal)\n",
      "label: 1 text: i also dig the extendable sling~ as more often then not its one less awkward move to my harness to grab an extra sling (i tend to rack my slings separate from my cams)   as for their appearance~ before i bought my dragons a friend showed me the slate dragon (#4 c4) and i thought it looked like a toy\n",
      "label: 2 text: as far as anything other then the sling i can see no need to bother worrying about width of the cams or thumb loop or springs ect ect ect\n",
      "label: 2 text: dragon cams are super solid\n",
      "label: 1 text: i pair them with borrowed bd's c4's and both cams slam into place\n",

      "label: 1 text: as for evolution in cams the dragons are definetly not that\n",
      "label: 1 text: ha~ went home~ put on my harness~ racked the cams as usual~ grabbed low on stem~ pulled up and unclipped from harness with ease\n",
      "label: 2 text: i consider this an advantage as it saves shipping cams in and waiting for a resling should you need em right away   - the dragons have less surface contacting the rock than the camalots in some of the sizes~ if you climb sandstone this might be a consideration   - some dragon sizes have a narrower headwidth than the camalots   - the dragons have the classic 13.75 cam angle vs\n",
      "label: 2 text: weve all seen the threads where \"well placed cams\" in vertical cracks supposedly walked and failed   - the sling is dyneema and more flexible than the bd nylon one ..\n",
      "label: 1 text: the question is how much do you extend your placements normally???   if you extend most cams with a short draw then the dragon can save you some weight~ especially on multi   if you dont or extend them long all the time~ theres no real advatange   most my partners who have used my dragons want a set~ several have went out and bought some   i own and use dragons~ camalots~ link cams~ totems~ tcus/powercams~ aliens~ zeros~ rock empire~ etc ..\n",

      "label: 1 text: it's pretty amazing to me that people are interested in these cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: these gear4rocks cams can't even get a thumb loop which will accept a sling\n",

      "label: 1 text: in comparison to bd cams~ which have a solid~ most likely machined axle with cir-clips keeping everything in place~ gear4rocks cams would~ in theory~ have higher stress concentrations at the threads\n",

      "label: 1 text: was actually thinking about grabbing a pair of the cams since they'd probably breath better than the ventas which can tend to get a bit clammy on warmer days\n",

      "label: 1 text: maybe this is an isolated event~ but i won't be buying any more cams from them.\n",
      "label: 2 text: lol it helps me to sleep at night knowing that they have a better cam angle and thus will stick better than most cams out there\n",
      "label: 1 text: +1 for metolius re-sling/re-wiring service! i sent back almost all my power cams and 1 tcu 2 weeks ago\n",
      "label: 2 text: i should also mention that with the zipper fold-down style~ when your bag gets pulled to be opened up by tsa with all your cams and crap inside~ it's a whole lot easier to open it up for them and then re-close it than with a top-loader\n",
      "label: 0 text: it will add durability~ but when cams last 10-20 years anyway it doesn't really make much difference\n",
      "label: 1 text: durability in free climbing use might be a wash but aid climbing tends to trash the stem/trigger areas of cams much faster\n",
      "label: 2 text: of course the x4 might not be as \"clutch\" as the softer cam basic/alien is and totem cams are certainly wiggling into the \"clutch piece\" space as well\n",
      "label: 0 text: not sure why but bd didn't give the x4 cams a tumble finish which left the cam faces with \"sharp\" edges\n",
      "label: 1 text: if you want biners for draws or racking cams individually~ get some normal wiregates so you can tell the orientation at a glance.\n",
      "label: 1 text: is their pro based off of any other companies products? i know protection is nothing to bargain hunt on but i'm going to start building my own rack and if their cams are solid their bundle appears to be a good place to start\n",

      "label: 1 text: i'd like to see a force balance of these compared to traditions cams with stems..\n",

      "label: 2 text: i use bd cams for the because they feel the most secure in my hand while placing and/or cursing\n",

      "label: 0 text: i watched the cams carefully and they didn't budge\n",

      "label: 2 text: now drop them in sand below a tower and see how those wires behave- i have yet to encounter a climbing situation where this cam design would offer an advantage over cams that are currently on the market..\n",
      "label: 1 text: i'm interested in why these cams (apparently) hold in downward flaring placements\n",
      "label: 1 text: i suspect that the direct loading of the cams may result in less force on the axle\n",
      "label: 1 text: here's my logic: traditional cams load the lobes through the stem~ which applies shear stress to the axle~ the opposing force of the lobes also applies shear stress to the axle\n",
      "label: 1 text: the totem cams only have shear stress being applied to the axle by the opposition of the lobes~ so there is potentially less stress on the axle\n",
      "label: 2 text: the totem cams performs better in downward flares because the cam angle is 20~35 degrees\n",
      "label: 1 text: i have uploaded on our web site a paper explaining how regular cams and totem cams work on parallel and flared cracks\n",
      "label: 1 text: i wrote up a review of the totem cams: pullharder.org/2010/09/05/t…   it took me many hours to complete the review~ so i'm just linking to it instead of reposting and reformatting\n",

      "label: 1 text: it¡¯s been said that if you¡¯re not climbing high end routes~ why buy high end gear? in fact~ a full rack of small wired nuts to cover the range of these lil cams would cost a fraction of the scratch\n",
      "label: 1 text: furthermore~ there¡¯s no style points deducted for spending money to make up for our physical inadequacies~ in fact~ you¡¯ll likely have more buddies as you gather more gear:-) truthfully~ owning any of these cams is much like sleeping with any miss america pageant contestant\n",
      "label: 1 text: like the miss america analogy~ choosing cams~ much like choosing a spouse~ is an intimately personal thing\n",
      "label: 1 text: and again~ similar to any contestant you hit on~ no matter which one of these cams you pick below~ having any of them is the right choice\n",
      "label: 1 text: except for the splitter cams~ which may be more like sleeping with your unattractive cousin\n",
      "label: 1 text: some decisions you will need to consider:   do you mostly climb free or aid?    offset lobes or regular?    3 cams or 4?    extendable sling or not?    stout long life nylon or skinny lightweight dynema sling?    single stem or double stem?    as material science evolves~ the cam components and assemblies become better\n",
      "label: 1 text: if you are a low maintenance kind of person~ and don¡¯t want to be re-slinging cams every few years~ give this some serious consideration\n",
      "label: 1 text: small cams can be divided into camps of single stems and double stem units\n",
      "label: 1 text: this is a personal choice i made after having sent all of them back while dave waggoner~ the owner of the company~ was still alive (even some old beat up cams that had seen falls) to be re-tested~ stamped ¡°tested¡± and returned to me\n",
      "label: 1 text: due to this~ many climbers smarter than i put them on e-bay~ and moved on to obtain the reliability available with all the other manufacturers making the cams discussed below\n",

      "label: 0 text: bd has not given up surface area to get the short width either~ look carefully and you¡¯ll note that the cams themselves cover the stems\n",

      "label: 1 text: the cams aren¡¯t for me~ yet my climbing buddy tried these out and immediately wanted a set\n",
      "label: 0 text: this is due to lack of space on the cross piece~ thus you must palm the top of the u shaped stem to retract the cams~ for those who already dislike double cable stem units~ you¡¯ll hate this\n",
      "label: 1 text: the other (minor) issue~ if you need another one~ is that while the metolius and bd cams can almost be found in the corner 7-11~ these have some seriously limited distribution\n",
      "label: 2 text: if that floats yer boat~ and it is a feature favored by many~ and you want to pay more than the metolius cams cost to have a few less placements available to you~ have at it\n",
      "label: 1 text: truthfully~ the part in the introduction where i discuss how little difference between the best and the worst cams are should be reexamined here\n",
      "label: 2 text: although i say here that the dmm 3 cams finish in last place~ it is but only by a nose: they are still a very well made and high quality product\n",
      "label: 1 text: metolius uses a kevlar cord for the retraction of the cams instead of swaged wire\n",
      "label: 0 text: one of the big issues not widely published is that in some certain rare placements~ where the cam can bend back up on itself~ the trigger can inadvertently cause the cams to release\n",

      "label: 1 text: for free climbing~ with the larger versions of these (say #3 and up) you get real good holding power~ light weight~ and between the floppier cable and the fact that all wc cams have a doubled (extendable) sling~ you will have less need for quick draws to extend your cams~ and clipping that crux piece while you a hanging on with your failing fingers on a wandering route is a lot nicer experience\n",

      "label: 2 text: better cams and lower prices\n",
      "label: 1 text: so far though~ no whippers on them~ have placed only a couple times as a second backup in a spot where i was saving my real cams for the next move.\n",
      "label: 0 text: in older cams didn't the nuts on the sides have a nasty habit of coming unscrewed which is why modern cams don't use them?\n",
      "label: 1 text: these cams seem like a good alternative to the popular brands\n",
      "label: 1 text: i know i have a bias because they were free~ but they arn't bad cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: if gear4rocks cut the price significantly they would be a decent alternative to paying retail for bigger name cams.\n",
      "label: 2 text: totem cams have come up with a truly innovative design that holds much potential to provide excellent holding power in tricky placements while at the same time maintaining a large expansion range and light weight\n",
      "label: 1 text: while the cams rotate around an axle~ load bearing cables wrap up and around a pin on the back of each lobe~ and extend down past a trigger to a loop below\n",
      "label: 1 text: due to a larger camming angle~ these cams have the potential to hold in downward flares of up to 40 degrees\n",
      "label: 1 text: due to this unique design~ totem cams have the largest expansion range of any single axle symmetrical cam on the market~ comparable to black diamond’s c4 double axle design\n",
      "label: 1 text: the cams come in a set of 5\n",
      "label: 2 text: they are roughly the same size as the blue and yellow metolius~ and the purple~ green~ and red c4s~ which works perfectly for me since those are the cams i’ve climbed on for years\n",
      "label: 0 text: other than that discrepancy~ the cams generally had slightly more range than claimed~ and the weights were within about a gram of what was claimed\n",
      "label: 1 text: someone asked me to measure the head width~ which i did~ because these cams probably have the narrowest heads on the market\n",
      "label: 1 text: if you’re curious about how other cams compare~ then just grab a ruler and measure whichever brand you’ve got handy\n",
      "label: 1 text: i replaced one set of blue and yellow metolius~ and purple~ green and red c4s on my double rack with the totem cams and used them head to head with the other cams\n",
      "label: 2 text: i’ve hung on them using only two lobes~ but overall i haven’t gotten around to really pushing their limits for two reasons: i don’t want to break one early in the review process~ and i haven’t had time yet!    so~ what are benefits of totem cams over other cams on the market? they have an innovative elegant design that increases holding power in flares~ and increases camming range for a single axle design\n",
      "label: 2 text: i believe the smaller sizes have more expansion range than most competing small cams~ like for example metolius tcus\n",
      "label: 2 text: also~ without a proper stem these cams are obscenely flexible without compromising on usability at all\n",
      "label: 1 text: i know this is subjective~ but these cams just feel damn solid when they’re set\n",
      "label: 1 text: so far~ in my opinion~ totem cams represent a true improvement in cam design and functionality\n",
      "label: 1 text: while the upsides to the cams are many~ there are downsides as well\n",
      "label: 1 text: as of yet~ there are only 5 cams to a set\n",
      "label: 1 text: this is a limited range~ and so a typical rack would require more brands of cams\n",
      "label: 0 text: intentionally or not~ they have done a good job of sizing the cams with some other popular brands~ so this problem may be minimized depending on what brand of cams you climb on\n",
      "label: 0 text: the totem cams are currently expensive\n",
      "label: 0 text: it is not nearly as low profile as many other cams on the market when hanging on a gear loop\n",
      "label: 1 text: i assumed that this would make cleaning the cams more difficult~ if not impossible~ in such situations\n",
      "label: 0 text: i’ve had the cams for over a month now~ and i haven’t had nearly the time i would like to fully evaluate them\n",
      "label: 1 text: i thought i lined up someone to take the totem cams up a wall in yosemite~ but that has apparently fallen through\n",
      "label: 1 text: a link to sign up for the demo on rockclimbing.com is here: rockclimbing.com/...rum.cgi… while these cams have impressed me so far~ i believe this is an area where the cams may truly shine\n",
      "label: 1 text: i would like to see how robust the cams are\n",
      "label: 1 text: as mentioned above~ i’m concerned about cleaning the totem cams\n",

      "label: 1 text: i’m working full time and going to school full time so it’s been brutal finding time!    note: these cams were provided free of charge under the agreement that a review would be written and posted on the internet\n",
      "label: 0 text: before they were sent~ i specifically informed totem cams that despite receiving them for free~ i would not favor the cams in any way in my review\n",
      "label: 1 text: tcu/mastercam!  least amount of overlap of any cams in that range\n",
      "label: 2 text: they are fun to place and i use them every once in a while (i used them more before i purchased small cams)\n",
      "label: 1 text: as long as you're building your rack of questionable gear~ the ad also had a bunch of hb cams and some *gasp* black aliens\n",
      "label: 2 text: the metilious master cams are real nice for smaller cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: check out like robot and durango cams if you want some cheap ones\n",
      "label: 2 text: pros:   extremely light   easy to place   good sizes/range   extendable sling   great clinking noise   great price   cons:   soft springs (walking)   fully retracted trigger doesn't fully retract cams (can make them really really really hard to clean)\n",
      "label: 1 text: but how they show ropes and cams to be gender specific is beyond my brainstem to figure out\n",
      "label: 2 text: i am impressed you could get all those cams on the gear loops and it did not de-pants you.\n",
      "label: 2 text: gear loops are reversible and large enough for a double rack of cams plus quickdraws\n",
      "label: 1 text: 90 bucks for totem cams! those things are worth more than their weight in gold! what is up with that?!\n",
      "label: 1 text: youtube.com/watch?v=dkyuzvm… youtube.com/watch?v=oenr8cb…   i'm not trying to diss the company (i have the master cams 0-4) just trying to inform    whats your guys and girls thoughts? --edit~ i read the comments and changed the title~ good to know that the cams work well\n",
      "label: 1 text: well~ it does address this idea that there was ever something wrong with master cams and does so in the first few posts\n",
      "label: 1 text: i've had them resling cams for me 4 different times~ and each time i was impressed by how quick they sent them back.\n",
      "label: 1 text: you can send most cams to their manufacturer for a resling~ i know bd and metolius will do that\n",
      "label: 1 text: they cleaned the cams and lubed them up too.\n",
      "label: 1 text: i think i had 5 cams reslung with double-length slings (10\" sling doubled up) for less than $30.\n",
      "label: 0 text: dang~ i used to own some of those cams with the allen screw and nut when i first started climbing~ even fell on them a bunch..\n",

      "label: 1 text: while they don't have the range of regular cams they come in handy enough that i usually have a few on my rack\n",
      "label: 1 text: there's a nice review on the master cams\n",
      "label: 1 text: i'd like see a comparative lab destructive pull test one equivalent size from all of the cams maufacturers available randomly purchased from multiple outlets\n",
      "label: 0 text: different parts of different cams might fail first\n",
      "label: 1 text: any updated opinions on  master cams?  pros?  cons?   i'm contemplating getting a set~ but most of the reviews on these cams really haven't had much climbing on them~ or many/any falls\n",
      "label: 0 text: as with most of the metolius cams i've used~ there isn't decent overlap between the sizes\n",
      "label: 2 text: the fact that it so consistently happens with metolius cams (even pre-range finder) means that its something with the cam angle\n",
      "label: 2 text: i agree that with the ranger finder it appears that metolius cams are \"overcammed\" when placed correctly\n",
