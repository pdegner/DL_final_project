,Hi all~ I am in the market for a new plaquette style device,1
0,I currently have a Reverso 4~ but I am contemplating between a Pivot~ ATC Guide~ or Reverso,1
1,I know they all operate essentially the same,1
2,"When updateing my device~ I am looking for the device that has the least friction when bringing up a second in ""Guide Mode""",2
3,I already have a GIGI that I carry on longer routes~ but would like a single device that is easiest on my elbows when climbing shorter multipitch routes,1
4,What are everyone's thoughts with regards to this?,1
5,Easiest on the elbows would definitely be a Grigri,2
6,I carry one in addition to the plaquette on short multi pitch routes (and some long ones too),2
7,Otherwise~ anything besides the Reverso,0
8,I've found it to have mucho drag,0
9,Make sure that you dedicate a nice round stock carabiner as the blocker too...,2
10,DMM Pivot,1
11,Both the Pivot and the ATC guide accept ropes to 11mm according to their spec sheets,2
12,Some people claim the rotation of the Pivot makes it easier to pull in rope in guide mode~ but I haven't tried one so I can't speak to that personally,2
13,I agree with Mike that the blocking carabiner matters and a grigri is best for single followers,2
14,I use the grigri more than anything else because of the ease of hauling~ lowering~ and lack of elbow pain,2
15,I have a preference for the ATC-guide because I like the orientation on my belay loop if using it for ascending (when that rare occurrence happens) and it's cheaper for me than the Pivot,2
16,What's keeping you from using the GIGI for shorter climbs?  It's not good for lead belaying~ but you can just give it to the leader for every pitch,0
17,Thanks Adam! As a clarification~ When climbing most multipitch routes our party generally tends to carry one Gigi and one GriGri and switch at each belay,1
18,Where I currently am~ most the multipitch routes are about 3 pitches in length,1
19,"On these I like to just carry my ""Guide"" device to keep things less cluttered and simple~ plus it is the most versitile belay device overall",2
20,I understand the added benefits of lowering with a Pivot~ and the orientation difference with the ATC Guide,2
21,I've considered this~ and I am basically just looking for the ranking of least friction to most friction when belaying from the top with those 3 devices,1
22,I hope this helps clarify my original question,1
23,Thanks!,2
24,Right on~ Chris,2
25,In that case~ the Pivot is probably your best bet,2
26,grigri,1
27,To be fair~ a Gigi adds very little weight or bulk~ and it is still easier to pull slack through than any tube style plaquette.,2
28,I cannot speak from direct experience~ but I believe that the Mammut Bionic has the lowest friction in guide mode of any tube style device on the market,2
29,If maximum versatility is what you are looking for~ I would check out the the Gigajul,2
30,but I honestly think the Gigi/Grigri is the best setup for short multi-pitch climbs with single ropes,2
31,Hey Karl~ Thanks for your reply,1
32,I have tried out the GigaJul thinking it would provide the most versatility,2
33,While I still believe it could theoretically be the most versatile~ I there just seems to be way to much drag when belaying with this is any form (toprope~ lead~ or from above),0
34,In my experience~ unless you are using ropes smaller than about 9.2~ it is just a pain,0
35,But again~ thanks for your input,1
36,I have not looked at the Mammut Bionic~ that may be work checking out.,2
37,If you liked the Gigajul~ except for the relatively high friction in guide mode~ you might also want to check out the Mammut Alpine Smart,2
38,It is a bit bulky for my taste~ but guide mode is much lower friction,2
39,did you try the gigajul or megajul? i've had both and the gigajul is much better for friction,2
40,my favorite tuber,2
41,This chart is a bit dated,0
42,It comes from an old article on Www.cascadeclimbers.com But~ it is at least a starting point for discussion.,1
43,+1 for pivot,2
44,Marty~ That is an interesting chart,2
45,This is essentially the data I am looking for,2
46,I wonder if there are any updated or newer more comprehensive versions of this,1
47,Thanks!,1
48,Ovo or Gigi,1
49,Weighs nothing~ easy pull,2
50,You could literally put it in your pocket.,2
51,I've used a few of the other devices mentioned--namely the gigajul and pivot--and like them a lot for certain uses~ but my favorite guide-style device for multipitch is still the Bionic Alpine from Mammut,2
52,No fancy assisted-braking features (other than guide-mode)~ but it feeds and takes in <10mm ropes like a dream,2
53,It's also a lot more durable than full aluminum tubers like the pivot or reverso due to the use of steel for the rope-bearing surfaces,2
54,If your main rope is >9.5ish~ the Bionic and ATC guide are going to feed better than the pivot~ reverso~ gigajul~ IMO,2
55,The latter two are better suited for slimmer singles or halves/twins,2
56,Does anyone have experience with the Up Mocc from Unparallel Sports? I used to love Moccasyms because they worked great for my wide feet,2
57,I recently purchased a new pair~ and they were so narrow~ I couldn't get my foot into my normal size,0
58,How do the Up Moccs size compared to the Moccasym? I typically would buy a 9.5~ which would be a quite tight sport shoe for a couple months~ and then would stretch out to gradually become something I could wear all day,2
59,Thanks!,1
60,I got them because the mocs aren't what they use to be,0
61,I'm 13 street shoe~ mocs 11.5,1
62,I purchased the up moc in 11.5,1
63,(Worn this shoe for 10+ years now),2
64,They are sized the same,1
65,"However~  the up moc is ""thicker"" and slightly more aggressive",2
66,So its a tighter fit,0
67,If I purchased another up moc I'd Still get an 11.5 I guess,0
68,But they still haven't broken in as much as the syms,0
69,UpMocc wont stretch as much as the 5.10 mocc,2
70,The up mocc does not stretch much at all~ I size the same as 5.10 mocc,0
71,I have a few pairs~ 1 on its 3rd sole and they still fit tight,2
72,Normal moccs never last me this long~ they fall apart,0
73,Very helpful,2
74,Thanks all,1
75,I picked up the UP Moccs a couple months ago for the same reasons you describe,2
76,Absolutely love them,2
77,I got the same size that I used to wear in the older Moccasyms and they fit perfectly~ though--as others have said--they don't stretch nearly as much,2
78,Stickier than the five tens (IMO)~ and they have the best heel of any slipper I've tried,2
79,Just a heads-up: the reinforced pull-tab on the top initially caused a weird pressure point for me~ but it softened up after a couple of uses,0
80,Arc'Teryx's warranty is useless,0
81,I own a lot of Arc'Teryx products that I've accumulated over many years,2
82,I also own gear from other makers such as Patagonia and Outdoor Research,2
83,I've submitted claims to Patagonia with no problem,2
84,Send it in~ get it back repaired~ simple~ no hassle,2
85,I recently had an issue with Arc'Teryx shorts,0
86,While they're about 10 years old~ I only wore them occasionally~ casually and on a few day hikes; nothing harsh,1
87,They were washed in cold water and hang-dried,1
88,A couple weeks ago~ I pulled them out of my closet to discover the welded pockets were failing,0
89,I contacted Arc'Teryx and they demanded a proof-of-purchase before repairing,0
90,seriously? Who keeps receipts beyond a year or two? Patagonia and OR make no such requirement and such is not stated on Arc'Teryx tags,0
91,I will NEVER again buy anything Arc'Teryx,0
92,Their warranty is meaningless.,0
93,I’ve heard that sometimes it can really depend on the Customer Service Rep you get,0
94,For a counter-example~ I broke the zipper divider on one of my Arc jackets last year,0
95,Sent them a picture~ and they sent me a new one right away,2
96,Point is~ it’s not meaningless...,2
97,I have noticed a general theme as well,1
98,Patagonia and OR seem to stand behind their stuff in ways that I find remarkable and loyalty-inspiring,2
99,Arc’teryx seems to try to weasel out of their version of doing the same 1/2 the time~ and repair well and easily~ if not graciously~ the other 1/2,0
100,So~ my perspective is that it’s not meaningless warranty~ but that I do not depend on it,0
101,I still buy their stuff when I like it best~ but unless it’s a clear favorite I skew towards other brands.,0
102,They recently repaired a zipper for me~ no questions asked,2
103,I dropped it off at an Arcteryx store which may have worked in my favor,1
104,Glad they didn’t ask for proof of purchase since I bought it used on MP.,1
105,I've had Outdoor Research and Mountain Hardwear step up in big ways in the last year or so,2
106,Both times I returned items saying I was happy to pay for a repair as they were 5ish years old and had seen considerable use,2
107,In the spirit of not tossing otherwise functional gear I wanted it repaired as professionally as possible and was more than ok with paying for it,2
108,Both companies replaced expensive items even when I offered to pay a pro deal price at a minimum as I didn't consider it warrantied gear failure,2
109,Demanding a repair on 10 year old SHORTS?? Come on man - don't be like this,1
110,Arcteryx makes some quality stuff,2
111,I’ve never had a problem with their warranty,2
112,I had some stitching pull on a glove I bought at 50% off,0
113,They determined it to be a manufacturing defect and gave me a full priced credit~ which I promptly put back into a killer pair of Arc gloves,2
114,The whole process was seamless for me.,2
115,Here's their warranty for clothing,1
116,"Ten years is a pretty good run for a pair of shorts:""Practical Product Lifespan means the usual and customary wearable life of the product",2
117,The Practical Product Lifespan does not mean for your lifetime or mean a time period that is indefinite,1
118,The manner in which the product is used directly impacts the usual and customary wearable life of the product~ as materials will deteriorate and fade over time and moving parts will also wear,1
119,Arc’teryx Products are designed for long life and durability~ if care instructions are followed carefully,2
120,If your Product appears worn out~ then it may be time to replace your product and we hope that Arc’teryx will be a part of your next buying decision,1
121,Practical Product Lifespan will be determined in the reasonable discretion of an authorized Arc’teryx Customer Service representative who shall take into account at least the following factors: the type and nature of the Product~ the nature of the use of the Product~ nature of the Product issue involved~ and age of the Product,1
122,"The Arc’teryx Customer Service representative may require consumer information in order to make the foregoing determination and may not be able to make a determination without such accurate information from the consumer.""Edit: This is a very vague warranty",1
123,"Almost ""meaningless~"" to quote the OP",1
124,Still~ 10 years of use seems good enough to me,2
125,Sounds like the repair or replacement is subjective and totally at their discretion,0
126,Not necessarily wrong~ but vague.,0
127,Interesting,1
128,Have had the same failure but was never asked for proof of purchase to get it fixed,1
129,I agree~ that’s lame.,0
130,But that wasn’t the reason they denied service,1
131,Your point is valid~ but irrelevant.,1
132,I see what you did there.,1
133,But that wasn’t the reason they denied service,1
134,Your point is valid~ but irrelevant,1
135,Yeah~ not having the receipt was the ostensible reason for turning down the warranty service.,1
136,That is your complaint....they wont repair or replace 10 year old shorts? Dude~ you must have more going and demanding in your life than that.,1
137,I see what you did there,1
138,#accidentalwordplay,1
139,Any reviews out there~ specifically for those that climb a lot on granite?,1
140,Here is my short term review having broken in the shoe and done a bit of rock climbing in it: The UP site is sorta wrong,0
141,It feels like a Hiangle in terms of stiffness~ but the rubber is thinner and more sensitive,2
142,The heel fits me a bit more snug,0
143,The shoe is slightly less downturned~ but with less forefoot volume and a moderately pointier toe,1
144,The closure and entry system is actually super useful,2
145,A bit less midfoot volume than the Regulus and maybe the Regulus LV,1
146,The heel also feels way more secure for me,2
147,Super powerful toe~ but doesn't feel as clunky as many stiffer shoes,2
148,The rubber overlaps with C4 in terms of shore hardness and feels closer to C4 than the RH rubber of the Regulus,1
149,Not a shoe for smearing~ but could be a great granite/limestone/edging shoe,2
150,I wear a size 10 street and am a 9.5 Sirius~ 9.5 Sirius LV~ was a 9.5 Regulus LV~ 9.5 Hiangle~ 40.5/41 Solution,1
151,They are incredibly snug/tight at first~ but once on feel like a good balance,2
152,I could maybe go a half size up for longer sport/multipitch,1
153,These would actually be an awesome crack shoe,2
154,Very low toe profile and big toe patch,1
155,The closure system might get in the way when jamming really deep,0
156,I dunno,1
157,Super versatile shoe.,2
158,I tried on a pair of the VCS a half size down and they felt great in the heel~ but I had some weird dead space around the big toe~ felt a little long,0
159,Currently exchanging for 1 size down,1
160,It felt about the same stiffness as the TN Pro~ but with a snugger heel and better closure system if you want to tighten up that midfoot area,2
161,I think the TN Pro will still be my go-to bouldering shoe~ but the NewTro VCS will be for anything where I want more sensitivity and power in the big toe,2
162,Like small footholds on overhangs,1
163,It's also easier to get into,2
164,The toe was also more downturned than the TN Pro~ and seemed like it'd be worse for smearing just from walking in them,0
165,If I end up liking it more than the TN Pro~ I'll probably get the lace version too,2
166,It breaks in to be quite a bit more sensitive and can actually smear better than you would expect,2
167,Dan Turner has a glowing review on his YouTube channel,2
168,​ ​The TN Pro is weird to me,0
169,Fairly thick rubber and felt more voluminous than the Regulus in the midfoot.,1
170,What size did you go with for the NewTro~ half size or full size down from street size?,1
171,Sorry~ 9.5 in all UP shoes including the Newtro,1
172,My parents live in Tucson and I actually like The Bloc,2
173,Rocks N Ropes has the Tension Board now too which is nice,2
174,What/where is the other gym opening up?,1
175,No issues with the routes and the renovation at RnR is pretty nice,2
176,But~ had issues in the past with the owner or management staff,0
177,I’ve worked with a lot of college students who’ve all had ongoing~ very poor experiences with RnR regarding memberships~ fees~ and some pretty awful customer service,0
178,The climbing is great~ everything else is terrible.,0
179,Cool I’ll check it out when I visit my parents next,2
180,That and actually try to hit some of the local bouldering!,1
181,Does anyone use these cams? do you think  the expandable sling is nice? when I tested it in the store I felt like it kept getting stuck where the sling is sewed,1
182,Not trying to carry so many alpine draws if I don't have to.,1
183,Excellent quality~ lightweight pieces~ although sizes are slightly off from the similarly-colored Camalots (only really matters on Wingate),2
184,The extendable slings aren't long enough to make a difference~ in my opinion,0
185,Dragons have longer extendable slings~ but no thumb loop,2
186,yeah~ i really like the dragons but I also have small hands so I prefer the lump loops,1
187,if the expanding sling doesn't make a difference then I might keep my metolious double rack,2
188,I like them~ I have .4-3 in friends and C4s as doubles,2
189,When you extend the sling~ pull the bar tack (aka sewed part) away from the cam~ not the smooth side of the sling to keep everything neat,1
190,I find the extendo-slings handy when a piece is under a little bulge or just a tiny bit out-of-line,2
191,Placing a c4 or mastercam unslung I really notice the difference in drag/walking~ the Friend slings do have their use~ you just still need alpines or shoulder runners depending on the route.,2
192," Not sure the dragons are actually ""longer"" when measuring from axle to sling end:",0
193,I like them,2
194,I feel like this help save your alpine draws for the passive placements on a pitch,2
195,ain't nobody got time for that cmon now,0
196,There are definitely more than less scenarios that I take less draws due to having the extendable slings but I’d say that’s predominantly single pitch,1
197,I’ve come accustomed to always ripping the bar tack side to extend due to faffin with them a bit at times~ too,1
198,I have a friend who has a set of cams with extendable slings,2
199,They're super annoying to clean as a follower~ and +4 inches is useless for extension,0
200,I have Dragons and one of my partners has the Friends,2
201,"While the total length isn't very different~ the Dragons with extended slings just ""feel"" like they're extended more~ maybe because there's more sling and less cam stem? I have placed a Dragon with no additional extension~ but never done so with a Friend",2
202,With that being said~ they're super useful for getting the carabiner off of an edge~ like someone mentioned above.,2
203,I totally agree with this,2
204,I have a single rack of WC friends from .4-4 and depending on the route you still need aplines,0
205,The extendable draws on the WC friends is only good for little overhangs or extensions,2
206,I only really find the extension useful when pairing with a sport draw for when I need just a little bit more length,2
207,Lets me save my alpine draws for nuts and anchors.,2
208,I have a set of .4-3 WC friends with extendable slings and a set of C4s in the same sizes,1
209,They are great cams of the same general design~ but I generally prefer the WCs to the C4s because of the sling,1
210,Also~ there is no anodized finish on the contact points of the lobes on the WCs so theoretically they MIGHT grip better than a new C4? I have yet to be upset about having an extendable sling~ though I do not always use it,1
211,There are times where it provides just the right amount of extension and can save you from needing to use an alpine draw if you need to conserve them.,2
212," Doesn't this belong in ""climbing gear discussion"" not ""climbing gear reviews""? And you just need to get in the habit of pulling the strand with the bar tack when you extend",1
213,I'd also tell you partners to get in the habit of shortening it BEFORE they remove it and repack it when cleaning,1
214,These two things seem to be the main complaint~ though I don't understand why as it isn't that hard to be smarter than two loops of dyneema instead of one.,2
215,I put my color code mark on the heat shink over the stiching to make that spot stand out more,1
216,So you can see easily what to pull to extend.,1
217,Dude there isn’t any heat shrink on the bar tack that is the dmm dragons,1
218,I bought my 1-3 sizes~ I'm very happy with them really don't see why I'd go for anything else~ especially if you see any amount of aid in your future of climbing,2
219,Just came across it~ check it out - https://www.thegrommet.com/palmpress The pitch:,1
220,For backpacking or climbing~ I don't see this as an improvement over Aeropress or a simple cone brewing method,0
221,It seems heavy and limited,0
222,For home use~ looks like a nice option,2
223,As someone who has owned way too many coffee devices (French Press / Moka / Aeropress / V60 Drip)~ my current favorite - by far - is the Wacoco Minipresso,2
224,I found mine for $25 online,1
225,Don't get the knock-off imitations~ my girlfriend did and stopped bothering to send them in for replacement because the replacements would break almost immediately,0
226,It almost always comes with us when doing low-key backpacking or car camping,1
227,Espresso = minimum water usage but big taste,2
228,It's slightly smaller than an aeropress and just as sturdy,2
229,Tastes a million times better than Starbucks Via or Alpine Start,2
230,We did a blind taste test vs,1
231,a $200 home espresso machine and most people in the group preferred the Wacoco,2
232,We also included the aeropress / french press / etc..,1
233,Obvious caveat: if you don't like espresso and prefer coffee~ stick with what works,0
234,The non-espresso people were split between the French Press and Aeropress.,1
235,Where’d you find it for $25?,1
236,Where’d you find it for $25?  bought it new from Poshmark.com,1
237,If I'm going lightweight I'm just bringing instant coffee,1
238,No question,1
239,If I'm not~ I'm bringing my trusty old aeropress.,2
240,I'm with Chris,1
241,Instant coffee + 1/2 package of hot chocolate mix = backcountry goodness,2
242,Sometimes I use  filter system but to be honest usually instant~ it just feels more like camping that way.,1
243,It really depends if you like quality coffee or if you want your classic burnt go-juice,1
244,For quality instant coffee~ you're not going to find anything better than swiftcup,2
245,They have some wonderful single origin coffees roasted by some of my favorite roasters (check out ​This​​​ and ​This from middlestate),2
246,Aeropress with hand Burr grinder for Basecamp,2
247,V60/aeropress for home,2
248,If you want burnt go-juice~ Starbucks via and alpine start are fine,0
249,Not my thing though.,0
250,Also~ you can just buy the single-use pour over filter/bags empty from amazon and bring your own coffee.,1
251,yup first ascent is great!,2
252,Vietnamese Phin..,1
253,buy there for about a buck~ Amazon prime about $10,1
254,These are a few bucks..,1
255,smile.amazon.com/Vietnamese…;qid=1569271025&sr=8-33&th=1 There is a learning curve~ you need the right grind and patience,0
256,It takes trial and error and some diligence to figure it out,0
257,Making Vietnamese style coffee you want a strong shot,2
258,You want it to drip very slowly,1
259,I carry one and a grinder whenever I am traveling~ including solo international trips with only a day pack's worth of gear.,1
260,Just take Excedrin if youre backpacking,1
261,Way lighter,1
262,Drink good coffee at home,1
263,No gimmicky mini espresso will beat a real espresso machine in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing.,2
264,Alpine start is definitely the best instant coffee on the market,2
265,Its actually quite good for instant; plus Matt Segal started the company~ which is cool,2
266,Secondly~ the aeropress is the best coffee making system on the planet~ portable~ light~ simple~ makes good coffee,2
267,I take one traveling with me on international trips.,2
268,Completely agree! Although I don’t often drink coffee and don’t really understand its taste~ I like to drink coffee very early in the campsite,2
269,Gives a special charge of energy and an inexplicable feeling of joy,2
270,I usually just bring some blow...waaay easier,1
271,Sounds like you aren’t at all so maybe the Keurig type machine would work just fine.,2
272,Kettle and Chemex is classy looking and fun~ get a metal filter and you're set,1
273,Do not get a Keurig~ those things are terrible in the waste they generate and they make awful coffee.,1
274,Agreed,1
275,I've found that for me life in the backcountry is best when enjoyed in two distinct modes: Super Lux or Super Light,1
276,The in-between is a no-mans land,0
277,Heavy enough to be a pain but not enough luxury to really enjoy just hanging out,1
278,A decent french press will run you ~$20 and tends to be the gold standard.,2
279,I use an aeropress~ usually~ home and camping both,2
280,I like just knocking out the grounds and no washing,2
281,At home~ this goes into a separate compost container for my blueberry bushes,1
282,Win~ win~ win! I also have an ancient porcelain Melitta setup~ if I want lots of coffee,2
283,We've had an automatic drip type~ Mr,1
284,Coffee sorta thing in the past,1
285,Those are great to put on a timer~ and have coffee waiting for you in the morning! I'm not a coffee aficionado though~ so there's that,2
286,I buy coffee already ground~ or grind it at the store~ then keep it in the freezer,1
287,If it's just you~ and just now and then? Go with simple~ and the least waste~ if you like the results well enough,2
288,Keurig was the go to at the office~ so no one ever washed anything,2
289,Including the Keurig machine~ which got pretty ugly after awhile,0
290,If the results aren't to your liking? Go with what you actually enjoy,1
291,It's these little things that make up most of our lives~ after all,2
292,Best~ Helen,1
293,Oh~ I didn’t even expect such diverse opinions,1
294,Thanks actually,1
295,skik2000~ you're right~ I'm not a coffee nerd,1
296,Perhaps such stupid questions would not clog the thread here,0
297,:),2
298,During these months~ I use a cold brew coffee maker,1
299,Very smooth~ mellow~ and low acidity,2
300,Since it filters like a French press~ I actually filter the cold brew with Chemex filters before storing in jars.,2
301,I'm surprised nobody here has mentioned just doing cowboy coffee,2
302,Learn how to do it right and it's the best possible solution~ AND you don't need to carry anything extra besides the coffee,2
303,To me~ it's the simplest~ best-tasting system.,2
304,curious what you do with the wet grounds after you drink it?,1
305,Cowboy coffee will kill you,0
306,My only reservation about the minipresso is that it is difficult to get a shot close to hot enough,0
307,(Takes lots of preheating~ etc.),0
308,What am I missing~ Sven?,1
309,with a single prime~ mine measured 137.5 degrees in my mug this morning (I keep an insta-read on hand for tea),1
310,I agree that it's not as hot as I'd like - I prefer my espresso on the 'scalding' end of hot~ but it's fine as long as I don't let it sit out,0
311,I wonder if temp preference is a learned thing (I still don't know how Italians immediately shoot their espresso at the bar without wrecking their mouths) or an innate preference,1
312,This paper seems to suggest ~140 +/- 15 degrees,1
313,Don't tell my boss that I'm typing this instead of working,1

315,Sven~ It produces a surprisingly good shot,2
316,I guess the few times I’ve tried to use it in the backcountry I was disappointed by the temp if all,0
317,I’ve found the Starbucks instant coffee sleeves a better option,2
318,Lighter and as hot as you can make water,2
319,But not espresso~ of course,0
320,cowboy coffee or instant for simplicity,2
321,Otherwise~ I've always used a moka pot with preground coffee or a Flair Manual Espresso with manual grinder for car camping (yes I will I bring a stovetop frother and make a latte).,2
322,I'll chip in that I've really enjoyed my Handpresso Wild Hybrid,2
323,Got it for around $50 (the $130 retail is madness)~ and it produces a great cup of espresso with decent crema,2
324,If you get multiple baskets it's pretty easy to swap out for multiple servings (true 50ml shots),2
325,Portable with minimal mess or fuckery since it's essentially a bike pump,2
326,There's a bajillion belay devices available these days,2
327,Does one exist that can perform a double strand rappel~ belay in guide mode and provides braking assist? Note: this rules out the gri gri (yes~ I know about reepschnur's/biner blocks) and plaquette style devices.,1
328,Gigajul,1
329,Why rule out the grigri though?,1
330,Edelrid Gigajul,1
331,Mammut Smart Alpine too,1
332,I dont think  the assisted is worth it as much as it is a pain in the ass,0
333,Ruling out the gri gri since it's heavy and rules out two strand rappelling,0
334,How's belaying in guide mode with let's say a 9.6-9.8? More friction than an ATC-guide? Would it work in a simul-ling scenario? I sometimes use a gri-gri as a second when simul-ing,1
335,So do you recommend the device as a single device to bring up a multipitch?,1
336,So do you recommend the device as a single device to bring up a multipitch? Sort of,1
337,If the raps are minimal then yes,1
338,The problem is defeating the assisted mode when rappelling~ it will wear you down over time,0
339,I use it in the gym only and a reverso most everywhere outside (or grigri if partner is gonna hang),2
340,In simul you can use the guide mode off the hip (alpine grigri) I guess but depends on your teams preference,2
341,GriGriandastandardATCforrappelling Does that count as one?,1
342,grigri,1
343,I just started using a Gigajul and it does everything you're looking for,2
344,Assisted braking when belaying on double ropes is a bonus.,2
345,How well does a gigajul work with roughly 9.5 mm ropes? I’ve heard there is significantly more friction than a reverso/ATC Guide when in guide mode on similarly sized single ropes,0
346,Smart Alpine I rap with it in ATC mode - you simply reverse the device~ and no braking/locking to defeat,2
347,If I need it~ I add an autoblock,1
348,Belays smoother than an ATC guide in guide mode when using thicker ropes,2
349,Big difference,1
350,I'm hoping they'll release a Smart Alpine 2.0 - my partner uses the Smart 2.0 for lead belaying me and it is an upgrade in handling/smoothness and braking over the original Smart.,1
351,The mammut alpine smart is a great devise that does all that you are asking if you use it right,2
352,The climb tech alpine click up works for everything you want as well- I find it works really well but is a bit more fiddle to start out with,2
353,Alpine up or gigajul..,1
354,The Gigajul is pretty decent,2
355,I've tried it on an old 9.8 and it's not terrible,2
356,Wouldn't be my first choice of rope/device combo for a longer day~ but functional,0
357,Use a round stock biner,1
358,Rap in normal ATC mode,1
359,On a 9.0 it works fine~ pretty close to a reverso or maybe even a touch easier.,2
360,I have used a MegaJul for a couple years now~ and like it well enough,2
361,You can rap in non-assist mode to speed things up~ otherwise it is hard to lower smoothly,0
362,Good with 7.9mm to 10.5mm ropes,2
363,My trad rope is a 9.4mm Sterling~ and it works well.,2
364,If your interested~ me and my climbing partner both have grigris and when we rap down we just both hook on to opposite ends of the rope to counter weight the other person and shoot down that way,1
365,You set it up like a double strand and everything and it works great if you and your partner are approximately the same weight (40ish pound different between me and my partner),1
366,The Edelrid MegaJul checks all the boxes you're looking for~ but I just can't bring myself to recommend it for everyday use,0
367,I like it for alpine since I can give an assisted lead belay on twin/half ropes and it's super light,2
368,For sport climbing the smoothness is nowhere near as good as a grigri and it's a pain to let rope out once it's weighted,0
369,Belaying in guide mode on a thick rope is a pain and way less smooth than a BD ATC guide,0
370,I haven't used a GigaJul yet~ maybe those issues are resolved with the newer device.,0
371,Since 2012~ I've exclusively used the Alpine Up,2
372,With a minor work-around to start free-hanging rappels~ the locking feature is great,2
373,However~ I only use double 8.5 mil ropes~ and think that it would be too aggressive if you use thicker ones.,0
374,and if you don't think about the consequences~ sure its just that easy/safe,1
375,and if you don't think about the consequences~ sure its just that easy/safe As long as you have good knots tied in the bottom of your rope the worst thing that could happen is one person gets down quicker and has to lower the other person,1
376,Nash~ I like simul-rapping too~ but what you just said is simply not true,1
377,"There are several more possible failure modes - with failure here meaning ""death of one or both members of the party"".",0
378,So which has less drag for guide mode~ giga jul~ alpine up or mammut smart?,1
379,working off of the assumption that gear will not fail and both climbers are comfortable rapping and know what they are doing then it is safe to go down,2
380,It is not as safe as using a Joker or a figure 8 like I would do in a canyon~ but it is not meant to be because of the situation,0
381,I agree that people can die~ but that can happen using any device or any technique if the person using it doesn't know what they are doing,1
382,Cue simulrapping thread in 3~ 2~ 1 ...,1
383,Cut it out.,1
384,Can you share a picture of this setup? I tried something similar once~ but thought I set it up wrong because the amount of friction was so low it felt nearly impossible to control my descent,0
385,I've found the Gigajul performs different based strongly on the size of the locking carabiner you use,0
386,I'm sure it also varies based on the rope diameter~ but I haven't tested that as much,0
387,I think a lot of the variation that people report is just because they use a single size of carabiner,0
388,If you try a few different sizes~ you can dial in whatever performance characteristics you're looking for in a given situation (i.e,2
389,maybe use a thicker one for lead belaying for smoother feeding and a thinner one for rappelling to get the full locking effect),1
390,Why is it so hard to get a straightforward answer on the amount of guide mode friction for these?!!! How much worse are they than an ATC/Reverso/Pivot/Gri Gri with the ideal carabiner selected,0
391,Because it depends on the rope.,1
392,Thanks! I'm glad you chimed in because up until now~ I didn't realize it was impossible to compare the same rope on two different devices...,0
393,I haven't tried all of them~ but the MegaJul is more friction than the grigri with a Mammut Infinity or a Sterling Fusion Ion R  both about 9.4mm,0
394,Not enough to bother me~ and you save so much weight and can rap two ropes,2
395,I really only use guide mode when on bolted anchors~ else I use a re-direct.,1
396,I have all three devices,1
397,With a single strand of 8.7mm mammut serenity the order is mammut smart~ alpine up~ giga jul from easiest to hardest,2
398,Personally I am surprised~ I expected the alpine up to be the most difficult but the giga jul was much more difficult.,2
399,I haven't used a giga Jul or alpine up~ by my experience is that the mammut smart has the same amount of friction in guide mode as a bd atc-guide when both are in guide mode,1
400,The smart is a great device with the exception of the extra work involved in rappelling with it.,2
401,Difference in weight between a gri gri and an ATC is the same as an extra .3 c4 without the biner,1
402,"It's heavier~ but calling it ""heavy"" is disingenous since the weight difference is almost negligible",2
403,Gigajul is the most versatile option~ and lead belaying is just as nice as with a GriGri,2
404,I've started to use it recently and really like it~ although a GriGri is just as good for most use cases~ rappelling being the exception.,2
405,Got you,1
406,It depends on the carabiner you're using for the guide mode,1
407,Adjusting that will adjust the friction to your liking on either device,2
408,I recently weighted a bunch of different devices to compare,1
409,I think it hardly makes a difference,2
410,Except for the grigri~ each device needs two carabiners to belay from an anchor~ so I added that,2
411,You could argue that the second biner could be reused for something else though,2
412,Mammut Alpine series,1
413,I use a Grigri that I added a piece of cord too so it is always clipped to something,1
414,For long routes I’ll just go with a good old ATC but I’m always fearful of dropping it,2
415,Not the end of the world I know but a PITA for sure,1
416,Just like in skiing~ there is no such thing as a quiver of one! I've been taking up an Edelrid Gigajul and a Kong GiGi on multipitch lately~ and I've been pretty happy with that system,2
417,I like the Gigajul a tad bit better than the Mega Jul for rapping~ and it also feeds out easier while lead belaying with thicker ropes,2
418,While I love the smoothness of a Grigri while belaying in guide mode~ the Kong GiGi is so much lighter and takes up so much less space on a harness that I prefer taking that now,2
419,The Kong GiGi doesn't quite feed as smoothly as a Grigri~ but it's still pretty good (just be sure you know how to use one SAFELY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkkFmLoFcFc),0
420,The other nice thing about the GiGi is it doubles as another belay device in case for some reason I drop my Gigajul (although you can always use a Munter hitch in that scenario I guess),2
421,I NEVER use my Gigi or Mega Jul for belaying in guide mode,0
422,my arms get too worn out pulling the rope through! The one advantage a Grigri has over the Kong GiGi is the ability to quickly and safely lower while belaying in guide mode with just a simple redirect,2
423,I suppose if I was on a climb with a big roof and thought I might need to lower my second~ I'd take my Grigri,1
424,But otherwise I find it is just too heavy and cumbersome given its limited functionality,0
425,Regarding the Climbing Technology Alpine Up~ I really had high hopes for it,0
426,It excels in rappelling~ and I love it for that purpose,2
427,But at least with the rope sizes I use (around 9.2-10.2)~ it locks up too easily on lead belay and pulls like a bear in guide mode,0
428,I think with twin ropes it might work great~ but with a single rope it's far from ideal.,0
429,You can rap with a gri gri - its not very difficult to acheive with a biner block,2
430,No need to also bring an ATC,2
431,I head up with only a gri-gri on every multipitch I do and I also rap with it,2
432,After years of use~ I haven't had any snags or issues and it's a smoother rappelling experience,2
433,Not futzing around with an autoblock and you can ascend your rope much quicker if you need to,2
434,You can also self-belay and TR moves quickly if you want to add that to your rappel experience (and dial in that beta to send the next time you attempt the route),2
435," ""Gri-gris are better in every single possible measure - from safety to user experience."" edit:  Not quite",2
436,Weight~ price~ double rope versatility~ and admittedly unlikely scenario of a violent factor 1 fall causing the cam to disengage on the Jesus piece,0
437,Additionally~ I have had a biner block get stuck before where a regular rope would not have,0
438,Once that happens to you~ who knows~ you may believe it's a possibility.,1
439,edit:  Not quite,1
440,Weight~ price~ double rope versatility~ and admittedly unlikely scenario of a violent factor 1 fall causing the cam to disengage on the Jesus piece,0
441,Additionally~ I have had a biner block get stuck before where a regular rope would not have,0
442,Once that happens to you~ who knows~ you may believe it's a possibility,1
443,I've had a biner block get stuck before - it's a quick fix to reascend the rope and has only happened once after hundreds of pulls,1
444,You can also test the pull before rapping to see if it will or won't get stuck,1
445,I’m going to throw in my two cents I suppose since we’ve gotten around to discussing the Gri Gri more in depth,1
446,All use cases are situation dependent,1
447,That said~ i’ll swap between using an ATC guide~ MegaJul~ Kong GiGi and a Petzl GriGri,1
448,Depending on what I’m looking for that day,1
449,Anyway~ for the fastest rappel descents I’ve ever accomplished~ my partner puts their ATC on rappel~ then I choose a strand underneath their device and rappel it with the Gri Gri,2
450,No carabiner block or anything else needed,2
451,The side I rappel down has a knot~ the side I don’t does not,1
452,I clip my tether to the other rope so that it stays within reach and control,1
453,When I reach the anchor~ I clip in to a quad with my tether~ give slack~ yell “off rappel~” untie the knot~ thread the rope~ retie the knot and wait for my partner,1
454,They clip the quad~ we pull the rope~ stack rappels again and commit to the rope~ remove the quad and zip to the next anchor,1
455,My partner had the option to use a fireman’s belay from me~ or can add a prussik backup while I’m already sliding down the rope,1
456,No one has to wait for anything and there’s no unnecessary risks added,2
457,Can you share a picture of this setup? I tried something similar once~ but thought I set it up wrong because the amount of friction was so low it felt nearly impossible to control my descent,0
458,It was shown in the original Mammut instructions that came with my Smart Alpine~ although Mammut seems to have removed them from their current IFU,1
459,I think we've noted this on MP before,1
460,You just turn the device around when you load in the two rap strands = ATC style rap,1
461,"I don't find it lacks friction unless the rope is quite skinny and a steep rap~ if so you can use it ""normally"" or add a ""third hand""",2
462,Rapping in the standard mode sucks big time and is annoying,0
463,Great device otherwise,2
464,Thank you,1
465,I did set it up wrong on my one attempt,1
466,I'll have to try this and see how smooth it is,1
467,The jerky rappel was the only thing about it that I didn't like,0
468,My personal approach is to bring two devices (ATC or GiGi + GriGri),1
469,Is it really worth pages of hand-wringing MP threads to save 68g (the weight of a GiGi) off your rack? Plus then you have a second device in case someone drops theirs,1
470,If so~ others have well addressed the pros/cons of all the various devices in this thread (mega jul~ giga jul~ alpine~ alpine up~ grigri~ etc.),1
471,They all involve some sort of compromise,1
472,If not~ just rack up your tube-style device + GriGri and go climbing.,1
473,I like the GigaJul,2
474,Its very versatile as long as you pair it with the right rope,2
475,If the rope is too big of too fuzzy~ it becomes really hard to use in break assist mode and then you only have a very heavy (but more durable) equivalent of an ATC Guide,0
476,It definitely does not replace a Grigri for single pitch cragging~ but it's the device I want on a multi-pitch.,0
477,Any max rope diameter you suggest keeping under? I know fat/fuzzy can add a handful of mm's either direction.,1
478,Any max rope diameter you suggest keeping under? I know fat/fuzzy can add a handful of mm's either direction,1
479,Try it on the ground first,1
480,I've had a 9.8mm rope work well while an another one of the same diameter was a total pain in the ass,0
481,9.5mm or smaller should be fine,1
482,Rappeling works in assist mode~ but I agree with many reviewers that you get a smoother ride in manual mode with a prussik,2
483,Hello outdoor recreation hive mind,1
484,Looking to crowd source some gear research,1
485,My wife and I are currently looking for a new tent,1
486,When we're on climbing trips we prioritize comfort over compactness,1
487,So we're looking for a tent with an epic vestibule (or option to add one),1
488,At present we've looked at the Marmot Orbit 4P and the REI Kingdom 4,1
489,It looks like some Big Agnes have the option to aftermarket a vestibule on for additional money,1
490,Two doors ideal and must be free standing,2
491,Has anyone seen or purchased such a tent? I've spent a bit of time looking around but there are so many manufacturers out there I know there must be something I'm missing,1
492,Thanks in advance,1
493,I'm also looking for something in the 4 person range,1
494,My last tent got destroyed during a windstorm at Jack's Canyon~ so I'm also looking for sturdiness/durability,0
495,I've had trouble singling out higher end car-camping tents - most tents are either nice and backpacking oriented or cheap/(flimsy?) and car camping oriented,1
496,The two you listed look great in terms of being sturdy/solid higher end~ but I'd love to hear other ideas in the same range.,2
497,Not sure what you mean by epic vestibule~ but I'd recommend the REI Basecamp 4 over the Kingdom 4 unless you really want the stand-up height,2
498,The Basecamp will still have plenty of room to spread out for two people~ is much more stable in challenging conditions and is a lot easier to set up~ especially if you're short,2
499,The Kingdom is an excellent fair weather flop and drop tent if you're gonna be in one place for a while~ but I think the Basecamp 4 is much more versatile if the conditions might get a little sporty and you arent sleeping more than two people on cots and dont mind not being able to stand up fully inside the tent,2
500,The MSR Habitude is also a really nice tent that's similar to the Basecamp in terms of build and intended use,2
501,The Nemo Wagontop is another excellent option that is more similar to the Kingdom build (tunnelish shape~ more headroom~ etc.),2
502,It might help for you to think about what sorts of conditions you intend on using the tent in,1
503,A dome style tent like the Habitude or Basecamp is much better in prolonged wind and rain~ while the tunnel shape of the Kingdom or Wagontop provide more vertical walls and more consistent standing headroom throughout,2
504,Are you looking for a mesh heavy tent that excels in more humid environments where you need maximum air movement? Or will you be in the desert where sand blowing into the tent is a concern and more nylon panels down low could be advantageous? Do you prefer having greater privacy without the rain fly on (more nylon panels down low)? Or do you not care about privacy panels or figure that you'll have the rain fly on most of the time anyways?,1
505,@Gregory~ if you're looking exclusively for car-camping applications~ a dome-style tent like a Habitude or Basecamp (see above post) is what you want,2
506,Tunnel or cabin style tents are sails in high winds in unprotected tent sites and will implode quickly if not aggressively staked out~ and even then the stakes will only do so much with a cross-section as huge as tunnel and cabin tents have,0
507,If you're looking for a backpacking 4 person~ that's a whole different beast but the REI HalfDome 4 Plus~ MSR Papa Hubba/Elixr 4 are good places to start,2
508,In general for wind resistance~ well-designed pole sleeves distribute stresses better than clips (but are more of a pain to assemble) and hubbed poles are weaker than individuals,1
509,Though modern aluminium hubs made by DAC do a much better job in wind than the old cheap plastic hubs made by others~ provided all of the poles are seated fully in the hub intersections.,2
510,My wife is claustrophobic so we bought the Kingdom 4 and it is amazing,2
511,We sit in chairs and have coffee in the “garage” with no problems,2
512,If I remember correctly we had to buy it separately.,0
513,I also have the kingdom 4,1
514,Super roomy and very nice,2
515,Haven’t spent a night in a storm in it yet~ but I don’t have super high expectations,0
516,The poles are pretty burly though so I expect it to fair okay in everything except some super serious winds,2
517,If you're a baller:https://hilleberg.com/eng/tent/black-label-tents/saitaris/,1
518,Thanks Ben! Not looking for a backpacking tent~ have a lovely REI Dash 2 that's been amazing,2
519,Yeah I do desert~ windy~ dry~ but also mountain thunderstorms~ but rarely humid,1
520,I'll look into your suggestions.,1
521,You beat me to it,1
522,I've been on a couple of trips where we used Hilleberg tents,1
523,They seem expensive until you use one,2
524,I recently got a North Face Wawona 6,1
525,It’s big for what you need~ but it’s vestibule is definitely epic,2
526,It’s a really nice tent~ well designed,2
527,But easily the biggest tent i’ve ever owned.,2
528,...and about to whip,1
529,Would you prefer that piece of pro to be a cam or hex?  Rock quality is good~ placement is good~ this is the only piece between you and the deck,1
530,Hex although I rarely carry them,2
531,Saved my life once while the 2 cams above pulled,1
532,If the rock is good and the placement is good then I'm equally amenable to either.,1
533,There is a reason that in this scenario an experienced climber never carries hexes unless the hex placement is textbook keyed in and extremely unlikely to fall out after you climb past it and he knows the route takes one right there where he needs it,0
534,Tell me the last time you saw a test piece crack climb sent on hexes? It can and has been done~ but nowadays virtually never,0
535,Ever see Tommy Caldwell or Honnold carry a hex? In experienced hands a cam is far more reliable in more placements~ was faster to place on the way up~ and has more utility for the weight in other varying size cracks on the route,2
536,If your cams are ripping its you~ not the cam.,1
537,The best possible hex placement is much better IMO than the best possible cam placement,2
538,That said~ good cam placements are good enough that I only very rarely carry hexes.,2
539," The ""best possible hex placement"" is not available 99.9% of the time and you just filled the best jam with it",0
540,I would prefer if my piece was Jesus.,1
541,Per the OP if the placements were good..,1
542,then a cam only because it would be easier to remove?,2
543,Is the hex placed like a nut? Then a hex,1
544,Is the hex placed like a cam? Then a cam.,1
545,Def Hex because then I could say I took a 50 footer onto a Hex! edit: which I've definitely never done,2
546,Good question,1
547,The scenario I envisioned had the hex placed like a nut~ not like a hex in a crack at Indian Creek,1
548,The cam placement was also ideal,2
549,I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes,1
550,So in this scenario both are ideal placements,2
551,Cam because if it’s a hex I didn’t place it and now I’m wondering who the hell just placed gear for me in the middle of a lead.,1
552,You mean a Jesus Nut?,1
553,Blue DMM Torque Nut = 14kn Blue BD C4 = 12kn You've already placed it and are far above it~ so ease of placing it is a non-point,1
554,Bomber hex in this situation is more bomber than the equivalent cam,2
555,Moving parts = more chance for failure.,0
556,But how bomber is TOO BOMBER?!?!?,1
557,bull,1
558,I’ve heard that at 12 kn you completely liquefy~ so it’s probably immaterial,1
559,I’ve heard that at 12 kn you completely liquefy~ so it’s probably immaterial  You will wish you turned to liquid if you generate a 12kn fall,1
560,I don’t think most people realize just what a crazy amount of force that is on the body.,1
561,It happen to me~ my biggest whipper was on a big hex placed like a cam in a horizontal,1
562,I still carry the old wired small bd hexes,2
563,Not the big hexes,0
564,Any well set chock is fine by me~ im not shooting to rack up and look like the pros,2
565,Hex~ nut~ rp~ tricam~ double axle cam its all good man!,2
566,bull,1
567,Wrong,1
568,Cams can walk precisely because they have moving parts,0
569,Hexes placed as passive chocks don’t.,2
570,Then why do we extend nut placements?,1
571," ""You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro and about to whip..."" I get that this is a fun hypothetical to gauge the intangible ""bomberness"" of hexes~ but I feel the need to mention the Law of the Anecdotal Runout here~ which is basically the same function as the Law of the Anecdotal Whipper",1
572,Claimed Runout/2 = Actual Runout,1
573,The math is usually as reliable as that bomber hex you're talking about.,1
574,Unlike a hex~ a well placed cam can fail if the friction coefficient is low enough.,0
575,Roll the example back 10' when you're 10' above your last piece and looking for your next placement..,1
576,rolling into that improbably last 10'~ what would you rather have on you rack?  Hexes or cams? It's all hypothetical~ but at this point you'd assume that you're gonna possibly find another placement and you may be pumped when you find that placement,1
577,So~ at that point~ would you rather have a hex or a cam? Personally~ I dunno if I prefer my coffee without cream instead of without milk~ but I for-sure prefer to have a cam I can't place before I'd take a hex I can't place.,2
578,This is a trick question,1
579,"If both placements are textbook and~ ""bomber"" then who CARES what it is",2
580,Neither one will blow,2
581,Then why do we extend nut placements? Because nuts are not hexes and they behave quite differently,2
582,A hex on a dyneema sling like the wild countries doesn’t walk,2
583,A wired stopper tends to walk because of the stiff steel cable...,0
584,Trick question point #2,1
585,Why is anybody getting runout? If you can't reach your next placement from your current placement just drill a rivet,1
586,Better yet~ drill a hand crack and place a perfect 2,1
587,Then why do we extend nut placements? Reduce rope drag same as cams,1
588,An experienced climber would double up~ an old Tony Yaniro strategy~ to make that twenty foot runout more palatable,1
589,Why not a Hex and a Cam,1
590,Then~ go for it.,1
591,Black totem or pink tricam,1
592,Reduce rope drag same as cams,2
593,Incorrect~ but good attempt!,1
594,Incorrect~ but good attempt! Please teach me great master,1
595,Please teach me great master  1,1
596,Kevin has more experience with cams than the average guy will get in 20 average climbing careers.,1
597,So why do we expend nut placements,1
598,That was the question,1
599,You extend both of them to increase their security and reduce rope drag.,1
600,If both placements are bomber then I guess it comes down to: which piece will be easier to remove after the fall?  I don't think I ever removed a hex but maybe they can get welded like a nut,0
601,So choose the cam.,2
602,I see you've never climbed Reids direct.,1
603,I see you've never climbed Reids direct,1
604,More times than you can imagine,1
605,Well~ probably more than 10 at least,1
606,:),2
607,You extend both of them to increase their security and reduce rope drag,2
608,"Winner! Cams don't walk because they have springs (though the springs do lend an assist)~ they walk as the rope moves them~ same concern exists with nuts being lifted (or~ in a loose sense~ walking"")~ thus~ the extension",0
609,Man~ nothing kills a tangential~ barely there joke like an explanation.,1
610,I’ve heard that at 12 kn you completely liquefy~ so it’s probably immaterial  At that point you are in-the-material.,1
611,I would rather be above the cam~ because I'd be less pumped than if I placed a hex and I might not fall.,2
612,I'm in this boat more and more,1
613,Any thought of the piece not being completely bomber makes me look for another,0
614,sometimes the magic/sliding death X comes into play even!,1
615,Cam,1
616,If it was a hex it wouldn't be mine and I probably wouldn't have clipped it since it was so far back in the crack that I couldn't reach it.,0
617,That is what they do in England when there is only one place to put pro on the whole climb,1
618,If 4 pieces equalized makes it safe~ why not do it?,1
619,You will never beat a solidly placed static piece like a hex....Never~ never~never!,2
620,...I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes,1
621,So in this scenario both are ideal placements,2
622,The most bomber hex placement I can imagine makes me feel happier than the most bomber cam placement I can imagine,2
623,That said~ I can't remember the last time I had a hex on my rack~ and I have no intention of climbing with them unless there is some special consideration (e.g,0
624,icy rock),1
625,I find it amusing that Reed's pinnacle direct came up,1
626,I was thinking of that exact same route~ which really says something about the rarity of such routes.,1
627,With the assumption of a good placement I'm ambivalent,2
628,Hex~ cam~ nut~ pin~ bolt - all satisfactory,2
629,Have pitched off onto all of them~ over time,2
630,I'd add that I haven't felt the urge to tote hexes along on a climb in more than 20 years,0
631,Even when doing super easy but long approach / remote alpine rock routes~ I tend to go with cams and nuts~ not hexes,1
632,I personally don't find them as versatile,0
633,I learned to trad a long time ago,1
634,Hexes were once part of my A Rack,2
635,They went to the B rack and then finally~ through the fact of simple disuse~ they went to the bottom of one of my oldest spare gear bins,0
636,They haven't been disturbed in so long I probably need a shovel to dig them out of there,0
637,I'm not passionate about gear~ frankly,0
638,Its like any other tool~ a means to and end,1
639,We can all revel in a perfect hex or nut or cam placement,2
640,But at some point~ its just a placement~ and so long as the pro is solid for that placement~ it doesn't really matter what particular piece of gear is,1
641,I sense crusty trad wisdom in this post,2
642,It is appreciated.,2
643,Last time I used hexes I dropped purple Wild Country one and almost took out me belayer,0
644,But~ due to his catlike reflexes he deflected it with his arm and got a nice cut on it,1
645,I still keep the hexes hoping maybe I’ll find myself in a situation that would make me wish I had the hexes on me.,2
646,I trust nothing more than a bomber hex,2
647,I carry both cams and hexes,2
648,When a climb gets technical~ steep and physical~ I would never reach for a hex,0
649,They are usually too fiddly! Hexes shine as anchor pieces and pro at easy stances,2
650,If I climbed at places with splitter cracks~ like Indian Creek~ I would never carry hexes,0
651,Granite has long cracks~ like at Yosemite,1
652,If I climbed mostly on granite; I wouldn't use hexes,0
653,As it is~ I climb most at Seneca~ which has predominantly irregular cracks,1
654,When the climbing is steep and technical~ I reach for cams,2
655,When the cracks are too irregular~ I place a nut or a hex,2
656,Both cams and hexes have a place on my rack.,2
657,You can’t beat a bad cam placement with a hex because it’s too far back in the crack.,0
658,Rather whip on a blue offset.,2
659,Can I get a bolt?,1
660,this post would be @justbombergear approved,1
661,This hex gave me the confidence a cam couldn’t to run it out 20 feet on my 5.2 chimney proj,2
662,Cant beat a well placed hex on quartz~ the rock known for spitting out cams,2
663,+1 for hexes when you grab them like a tomahawk and toss 'em in there,2
664,can't do that with a cam,0
665,"i guess you could ""rodeo clip"" one of those extendable dmm hexes too.",1
666," Cant beat a well placed hex on quartz~ the rock known for spitting out cams ""On quartz~ you can't beat a well placed hex~"" might be true",2
667,But I can sure beat a well placed pretty much anything if it's on quartz.,1
668,I would want to whip on a camp placed behind a restriction~ so that if it blows~ it will still hold as a passive placement,2
669,With cams you can just hold the end and launch them into the crack like you're spearfishing,2
670,What happens next is the seconds problem.,0
671," Cant beat a well placed hex on quartz~ the rock known for spitting out cams forgot an ""ite"" there...",1
672,What is that?,1
673,What is that? Apparently we’re all in time-out,1
674,You will wish you turned to liquid if you generate a 12kn fall,1
675,I don’t think most people realize just what a crazy amount of force that is on the body,1
676,If you fall on a piece of pro and it receives 12kn~ you are only going to experience around 7kn (which is still a lot),1
677,If you feel 12kn~ then your top piece probably held 20kn (which will destroy pretty much anything other than a good bolt),1
678,This assumes you clipped a piece of gear to redirect the force.,1
679,Apparently we’re all in time-out,1
680,Nick was twerking and accidentally booty bumped the hide posts button.,1
681,This actually happens if you top out on the nautilus after climbing Mother #1 in Vedauwoo,1
682,In that situation~ a hex placed like a chock both keeps the rope from getting wedged into the crack~ and prevents rope drag,2
683,It is much more than 20' run out though,1
684,it isn't really a runout if you are just walking up a low angled slab though :),1
685,fair enough.,1
686,satan would place the 666 pink tricam,0
687,Satan would place a Link Cam so that it would explode when you fall on it and then its carcass would gum up the placement so the next climber is facing a 40' runout,0
688,A list of who hasn't been frequently flagged in the past might be more interesting,1
689,Or a list of the flaggers.,1
690,I've never had a cam fail (knock on wood)~ but all the I'd-fall-all-day placements I have made have been hexes~ nuts~ and passive tricams,2
691,So given a choice~ I'll fall on a bomber hex,2
692,That said~ I rarely take my hexes on multi-pitch now and usually let them stay home for single-pitch unless I know I need them,0
693,Sometimes I think of selling them~ but every once in a while I find that sweet spot where only a hex will do,2
694,Unfortunately~ it's usually when the hexes aren't with me.,0
695,A list of who hasn't been frequently flagged in the past might be more interesting,1
696,Or a list of the flaggers,1
697,A sensitivity test when setting up your account: more sensitive fewer posts to read,1
698,Maybe read only files for those allergic to information.,1
699,Good question,1
700,The scenario I envisioned had the hex placed like a nut~ not like a hex in a crack at Indian Creek,1
701,The cam placement was also ideal,2
702,I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes,1
703,So in this scenario both are ideal placements,2
704,Whether you’d fall on a perfect placement in solid rock after you’ve already racked and placed it is just one small aspect of why people prefer one type of gear over another; and I don’t think it’s gonna get you the answer you’re looking for,1
705,Like most here~ I’d be equally happy to fall on a bomber cam or a bomber hex,2
706,But I’ve never routinely carried hexes and likely never will~ while I (almost) never start up a trad climb without some cams~ so yes I prefer cams and no I’d have no preference which to fall on,2
707,Fuck how do you get in this list ?,1
708,I think the 3 best uses for hexes are 1) if you have to bail and leave a piece of gear and 2 ) they worked really well to hammer on your nut tool to get up stuck nuts,2
709,3) to keep a rope  from getting sucked in to a crack,2
710,I would whip on either if the placement is good in good rock,2
711,A hex still receives a kn rating and is basically a stopper/nut,2
712,Hexes we're once the standard for racks but that was before cams were invented,2
713,They aren't sketchy when used properly~ cams are just easier to handle and place quickly which is why many climbers never will use hexes anymore.,2
714,Hex:  a large Black Diamond cowbell although I'd have to walk back to the car (or head home) to get it more than likely as I rarely carry them anymore,0
715,(route specific) That said~ I have seen both nuts and cams pull on people in falls,0
716,2 examples below,1
717,1st) Cam story,1
718,I once saw a single~ only 1/2 way in shitty placement~ crumbly rock~ original ridged stem friend~ hold about 300 lbs (2 people) who fell @ 200' together on to it,0
719,(double fatality) Lowering them to the ground was a nerve racking experience for 2 reasons that still make me catch my breath,1
720,1st) We 3rd classed the descent and were over 200' up off the deck with no gear other than their stuff that had been left on the ledge,1
721,(no harnesses~ not tied in),1
722,Next~ for whatever reason~ a crowd chose to gather directly under us~ and there was plentiful large loose rock and boulders in the work area that likely would have killed them below had we knocked a single one off~ and they couldn't understand our directions asking them to GTF out of the way,1
723,That said~ I believe that a cam would be more likely to fail from what I have seen,1
724,2nd) Nut story,1
725,"I once saw (We were on P2 of the next route over I ""heard"" it rather than ""saw"" it - then we gave CPR till a doc showed up and said stop) a guy eat dirt after he pulled 4 wired nuts in a row~ 2 or 3 of which he had already fallen on",0
726,"At no time did this fella take a 20' ""whipper"" onto a piece although it was @ a 70' fall in totality",0
727,This was on a route known for solid wired nut placements yet dude ripped out 4 in a row~ 2 (or 3) of which had already held him as he hangdogged his way up (fatality),0
728,It's possible that I prefer a hex because I've seen more folks fall onto cams than hexes,2
729,Lots more~ more falls = more placement failures,0
730,So nut or cam? Ya pays yer money~ ya takes yer chances.,1
731,Since he mentioned indian Creek i would go with the piece that has the most surface are in contact with the rock.,2
732,Decking might be the most likely outcome,0
733,Rope stretch~ slack~ belayer lifted after you fall 40 feet,1
734,I know this may surprise you~ but there are rock climbs longer than 40’.,1
735,Jesus dude you’ve witnessed a lot of fatalities.,1
736,Can you explain this accident for a gumby? How did they both fall a full rope length onto one piece?,1
737,Can you explain this accident for a gumby? How did they both fall a full rope length onto one piece?  Sure,1
738,A young couple~ both experienced climbers~ climbed a 2 pitch route,1
739,I suspect~ based on what I saw~ is that this happened (a single hiker saw the fall and ran and we were the first he ran into~ the hiker was not able to describe the scene correctly~ and there was no way he would know what occurred),1
740,"What we got out of the witness was similar to: ""THEWY FELL COME NOW THEY FELL HELP COME NOW",1
741,(repeat) NOWWWWWWW,1
742,""" 250 lb dude led P2 and got to the ledge",1
743,Belayed 90lb girl up,1
744,I belive~ guessing on this~ that she couldn't get a piece out so they set up for her to lower him down to get it out,1
745,She peeled off her shoes~ got comfy~ put dude on belay,1
746,In the usual hubbub and flifflaff~ they stuck in a friend in a crack above them which was @ 20 feet over to the bolts but didn't double check everything~ and the end of the rope was tied to the friend but she wasn't tied in to it,1
747,She had him on belay and was lowering him,1
748,His weight pulled her over and they both hit a ledge on the way down which killed them both,1
749,He was @ 20 feet below her~ the rope going through her belay,1
750,Both were hanging on the cliff off of the friend and they were on the same rope~ which had held their fall when they got to the end of the bitter end of the rope,1
751,Sure,1

765,Thanks for taking the time to explain~ Billcoe,1
766,Huh,1
767,So she lowered him off her harness without a redirect and wasn't tied into anything? I figured this was some simul-ing stuff I didn't understand,1
768,Yeah~ that's exactly it Josh,1
769,Similar to Woody Starks accident (except for 2 ropes and Al was tied off in the back with much too much rope between him and the anchor,1
770,Woody was 69~ still getting up 5.10 and had climbed most of his life,1
771,Al was experienced and methodical~ yet still......,1
772,http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=808573&tn=0&mr=0 Anyway~ thinking about that friend in the rotten seam that held a crazy long fall and over 300 lbs on a single rope makes me change my vote to cam...........,1
773,Or perhaps neither.,1
774,Cam,1
775,Hexes are dumb,0
776,HEX or a Nut would be my choice,2
777,Cool~ cowbells climbing Glacier Point.,2
778,Anyone have experience with the new butora approach shoes? They look cool but not sure how they climb,2
779,I haven't found much reliable info on this pack and was wondering if anyone on here has used one,1
780,Seems like a good option for what I need and they're on sale right now so I'm tempted.,2
781,I have the Alpha FL 45,1
782,"Not sure how much carryover there is between the ""all around"" and ""fast & light"" models~ but it's been carried around town~ recklessly tossed in the back of trucks~ and stomped on with crampons above 18k feet",1
783,Doesn't show much wear and for being so minimal I never seem to feel it on my back too much,2
784,Would recommend.,2
785,I like most things about mine,2
786,Comfy and light,2
787,Carries ice gear well,2
788,Nice and bright inside,2
789,Cons: The bottle pocket on the side is stupid short,0
790,Not quite enough storage in the lid,0
791,YMMV It took a lot of effort to capture the lid closure loops in the plastic hooks so I had to file down the bumps inside the hooks but that was an easy fix,0
792,Seems to be holding up ok,2
793,When I took my 10 yr,1
794,old Kata 45 in for repairs they gave me the option of having it fixed—which would take weeks—or picking a new pack,2
795,Good warranty if you ask me.,2
796,The Alpha ARs are nice but nothing special (which is probably why there is so little information about it available),2
797,I bought and returned it because the Osprey Mutant 52 is just a little nicer all around IMO~ especially at carrying heavy loads,2
798,The Alphas AR are fine~ just not outstanding and I hated the finicky buckles,0
799,The smaller version is discussed in this excellent comparo review:thealpinestart.com/2020/05/…,2
800,I bought it and returned it,0
801,To me it did not carry weight very well and I hated the closure snaps - had very hard using them even without gloves - did not feel like trying it on a frozen belay..,0
802,Has anyone tried these yet?,1
803,The description doesn't say much,0
804,What's the difference between these and the regular ones?,1
805,Black vs red suede,1
806,The website says that the rubber is slightly different (1.1 vs 1.5)~ which I guess is the coefficient of friction (μ)? Strangely though the weight is listed as exactly the same (57g)~ so I dunno...,1
807,Looks like they are reintroducing the original design?,1
808,Just got them in: I can confirm that they are not the same glove just in red,1
809,The finger holes appear to be larger and the backing material is stretchier,2
810,Size large is now too big for me~ which is actually good thing,2
811,I always thought that I was a medium except for the small finger holes on the old gloves,1
812,Both Size Large,1
813,"Old vs new ""Lite"" gloves",1
814,"As I said in my last post~ finger holes on the new ""lite"" gloves appear to be larger and the material is stretchier~ which means I can finally downsize to a medium without cutting off circulation to my two smallest fingers like the old gloves did",2
815,I'm stoked! Now I just have a pair of larges that I need to sell,2
816,lol,1
817,EDIT: Rubber also appears to be stickier,2
818,Not sure how this will effect performance or durability~ but we'll see...,1
819,Thanks~ very helpful,1
820,the ocun v2 ruined the glove~ happy to see that they seem to have undone a lot of the changes in v3,0
821,The finger hole fabric used to be a synthetic rubber type material,1
822,Now it is more breathable / flexible,2
823,"The ""velcro"" is the shiney super grippy kind but they didnt finish then end of the strap well",0
824,The first 2 gens that was gone well,2
825,The wrist strap is wider,1
826,I am hoping this is going to make the hole fot the velcro less likely to tear,2
827,Like previously mentioned i think i will have to go down a size,0
828,I failed to mention the because the backing material is thinner and it goes over the hand knuckles the gloves will be overal thinner,2
829,okay,1
830,i know all of you are experts,1
831,Some miscommunication between my gf and I resulted in our dry-treated (core and sheath) rope being left in the bathtub for 2 hours,1
832,Should I be worried about it's strength being compromised once it's dried out? FUCK.,1
833,In just water? No,1
834,Water and Sterling brand rope wash,1
835,Not at all,1
836,Certainly cheaper to get a new rope....~,1
837,I sincerely hope this did not cause any tension between you and your girlfriend,1
838,Did you raise your voice to her and say a bad word?,1
839,In my experience~ it sometimes rains for more than 2 hours at a stretch in the mountains,1
840,Isn't that what a dry rope is for?,1
841,Consider a day of spring ice climbing,1
842,The rope is more or less soaked for 8+ hours,1
843,If a dry treated rope can’t handle that~ it’s not worth the price.,0
844,No tensions haha,1
845,Besides~ it was my fault,1
846,I figured it's fine but I don't ice climb and wasn't sure fully submerging for 2 hours is more water logging than dragging across snow or ice,1
847,Thanks for the feedback y'all.,1
848,I wonder why anchor ropes are made of nylon......,1
849,2/10 ....,1
850,well 3/10 ...,1
851,since you made it to 6 hours till you got a troll rating,1
852,how can you see a troll rating?,1
853,You just request it.,1
854,You just request it,1
855,In my tiredness~ I thought a troll rating referred to a new MP feature under our new~ non-REI overlord,1
856,In my tiredness~ I thought a troll rating referred to a new MP feature under our new~ non-REI overlord,1
857,Nope,1
858,K Weber gave you a rating in the same post that they mentioned it.,1
859,Nope,1
860,K Weber gave you a rating in the same post that they mentioned it,1
861,Indeed~ this history is well documented here on the Proj,1
862,Praise be unto him.,1
863,I think this troll post deserves 0/10 since it was a serious question~ albeit a silly one,1
864,I don't do any ice climbing or lead climbing in torrential downpours~ so my experience with wet ropes is nonexistent,1
865,Common sense told me it's fine~ but I figured I'd ask the MP oracle~ since the interwebs has wildly differing thoughts on how long to soak a rope when cleaning,1
866,Let's keep this fine thread going,1
867,You probably shouldn't wash your rope at all~ especially with soap~ unless there is poop on it or something,0
868," It won't make it ""clean"" (i.e.~ remove the layer of aluminum oxide that typically makes a rope look filthy)~ but it will diminish the dry treatment and the quality of the handling",1
869,I learned this the hard way~ with a coupe ropes when I started out climbing,1
870,Best practice is to keep it clean~ by using a tarp/rope bag whenever possible~  If it's getting dirty~ use a wet rag to wipe it off,1
871,If it's picked up a lot of grit~ you can submerge it in clean water a couple times to get the grit to drop off,1
872,But the propensity to pick up grit means your rope is becoming worn out,1
873,It will still work safely~ but the handling will start to suck and it will wear out your gear much more quickly (due to the grit acting like sandpaper when you lower and rappel),0
874,Also~ if you got mad at your girlfriend for her somehow being responsible for the washing instructions of your rope~ you aren't going to handle it very well when she misreads the descent description of Forbidden Peak and you end up benighted in 20 below temps,1
875,This sounds like a personal experience,1
876,I'll be doing that climb this summer,1
877,What do I need to know to avoid this epic? PM me!,1
878,ya I didn't actually think it was a troll post~ that was just poorly veiled sarcasm,1
879,And though tents are also made of nylon~ they don't hold the lives of you~ your loved ones~ and your friends hundreds of feet in the air~ hence my question,1
880,I knew ropes can get wet~ just wasn't sure that the submerging them for 4x the time the rope soap instructed was good.,1
881,Definitely agree with this 100%,1
882,My rope was loving life and was unbelievably clean until my last multipitch route~ when high winds caused my follower to tuck away our rope tarp until we returned to Earth,1
883,On the last rap to the ground~ the rope of course pooled in a perfect pile of loose dirt- not the granite slab at the base we were aiming for~ promptly ending my rope's clean appearance...,1
884,I wonder if the chlorine in the water could do any measurable damage to the nylon? I highly doubt it would do anything--obviously not for just two hours~ but could there be a certain duration that might be unsafe?,1
885,Hey all~ I've got a couple questions (see bold below) about CAMP Photon wiregates as racking 'biners~ as I ponder an unnecessary switch from BD neutrinos,1
886,Searching forums has been inconclusive (surprise)~ so since MP is in no shortage of opinions~ I'd love to hear your experience with Photons~ knowing that I'm particularly interested in the downsides (if any),1
887,THIN NOSE PROFILE: -   Light and allows for more space on your harness..,2
888,GREAT,2
889,But I also read in a different thread that the thin/more sharp spot between the basket and the nose could result in rope damage if you somehow manage to fall there,1
890,Is that fantasy or has anyone had that happen? WEAK SPRING: - The old version was a little weak in the spring,1
891,Was this resolved with the 2017 redesign? Are Photon springs now snappy..,1
892,and how long do they stay that way? I've only owned two Photons and one would occasionally get stuck in the open position~ resulting in its early retirement,0
893,Was that a one-off? Thanks!,1
894,Yes~ it happens,1
895,But this is a small percent of the rope severing incidents~ which in turn is small number in its own right.,1
896,I have a lot of photons,1
897,When the gates get sticky I just lube them and they keep working fine,1
898,Not a deal breaker for me,1
899,I still think they are great for racking and alpine draws,2
900,I have a few I use on alpine draws,1
901,I've never had any negative thoughts about them,2
902,The size and shape make them good for taking a double length sling and making an alpine draw short enough to not get in the way,2
903,Basically~ I fold it over like usual to make an alpine draw~ then do the same thing again so my double length draw is the same length of a regular alpine draw,1
904,I can undo one iteration to get extension equal to a regular alpine draw fully extended~ then if I need more extension under the other iteration to get it fully extended,1
905,Need a big carabiner to make that work with nylon slings,1
906,I previously used photons and nanos on all my racking biners but stopped,0
907,The nose on the photon is just not a good design and they easily get hooked around each other if you are thrashing around,0
908,One simple design change~ making the width of the nose wider than the distance between the wires on the gate would resolve my issue,0
909,Also the sticky gates do get annoying because you have to lube them frequently.,0
910,My photons are five years old~ never cleaned or lubed but the gate is still quite snappy,1
911,I feel like I’m in the minority with that but that’s been my experience.,1
912,^same,1
913,The thickness of the Photon at the rope bearing surface is very thin,0
914,Theoretically~ this would make rope drag worse and~ if taking lots of whips~ wear out your rope faster,0
915,Not sure if these factors are significant in real life,1
916,Something like a Petzl Ange has much more surface area in the basket,2
917,My favorite racking biners to replace Neutrinos are the DMM Phantom.,2
918,All my photons are great~ no issues~ and work as expected,2
919,No spring issues~ rope-drag issues any of that,2
920,Have never lubed any of them,2
921,I will continue buying them as my racking biner and bolt side biner for my alpine draws until they stop production,2
922,Now my nuetrinos (think I have one sticking) and my BD Oz (I constantly have 1-3 sticking and requiring lubricant) those are another story.,1
923,I've used them quite a lot and the gate sticking issue was very common a couple of generations ago but was resolved a few years back,2
924,They still will start losing their spring tension/snappiness after 400+ days of use~ but that's to be expected of most wiregates,0
925,I've fallen on them quite a lot at this point and have never had an issue with them,2
926,I have experienced the hooking issue Parker is talking about~ (mostly in chimneys and flares) but it's never been bad enough that I'd want to change to a heavier/bulkier carabiner,0
927,The light weight and low profile is well worth it to me.,2
928,Been using them since they came out,2
929,I really like them~ especially for alpine stuff,2
930,Never had any issues,2
931,Lately however I’ve been switching over to Mammut Crag wire and solid gate biners,2
932,They are a little more robust feeling and confidence inspiring,2
933,I’m also starting to use the Camp Dyon and like them but they are pretty pricey.,2
934,I'd go with nano 22 over photons for racking,2
935,If you're not going premium like chimera/alpha/helium/dyon~ might as well get some lightness,2
936,You can find them on sale for not too much more than photons.,2
937,I use a mixture of Nanos and Photons and like them both a lot,2
938,All of my alpine draws are photons and have been great for the last three years,2
939,I have a mix of the pre 2017 (some of which have inconsistent spring tension) and current design ones,2
940,The current models are fix the spring and tension issues,1
941,I have also become a big fan of the Dyons.,2
942,Sorry photons are only rated to like 6000 lbs,0
943,How much more confidence you need?,1
944,Sorry photons are only rated to like 6000 lbs,1
945,How much more confidence you need? I am in full agreement with you~  but the Mammut Crag is just beefier and just gives me a little more confidence~ I’m sure it’s a totally unfounded and I’ve taken lots of falls on Photons and will continue to but the Crag is starting to become my new favorite,2
946,I am in full agreement with you~  but the Mammut Crag is just beefier and just gives me a little more confidence~ I’m sure it’s a totally unfounded and I’ve taken lots of falls on Photons and will continue to but the Crag is starting to become my new favorite,2
947,I have a handful of the Mammut Wall Lights~ which are their equivalent of the Nano,1
948,I REALLY like them,2
949,I had never seen a Crag until you mentioned them but that looks very similar to the Photon in size and utility,2
950,I have been on the eternal search for the perfect biner,1
951,Right now~ my racking biners are all CAMP Dyon's for my Dragon II's and Neutrino's for C4's~ just because they come in the correct colors,2
952,Dyon's have the thinnest nose profile~ yet retain a good sized rope bearing radius,2
953,The CAMP Photon~ Orbit and the BD Hotwire are about the same size,1
954,The Dyon is slightly smaller~ and the DMM Chimera/Phantom are the smallest carabiner I will carry,2
955,I threw the Spirit in there for comparison,1
956,I prefer a full size biner for sport draws~ no reason to try and save a few ounces for the pain of a mini biner,2
957,All of my alpine draws have either a Chimera or a Phantom~ since I also have a rack of gear on me and need to shave ounces wherever I can,1
958,The action of the CAMP Orbit/Photon is much softer than either the BD~ Dyon or DMM wire gates,2
959,Some people like snappy gates~ others like softer gates,1
960,Clock wise from top left:  DMM Chimera; DMM Phantom; Petzl Spirit; CAMP Dyon; BD Hotwire; CAMP Orbit and CAMP Photon,1
961,+1 on sticky gate issues with the photons,0
962,Personally I've had this issue with a couple of my newer ones (last two years) rather than the previous generation,0
963,Lubing the gates seems to do the trick,1
964,Still my racking carabiner of choice.,2
965,As important as the axis pictured here~ (if not more so) is the profile as it informs how many carabiners you can fit on a gear loop,1
966,I haven't used BD carabiners in years now~ but that and weight were the two biggest differences I noticed when I made the switch.,0
967,I use a gear sling if I am having trouble with too much gear on my harness,1
968,I actually hate the feeling of a full rack on my waist~ so I tend to use a sling for most multipitch climbing,0
969,Thanks for all the productive insight everyone~ I really appreciate it! There has been zero thread drift~ no infighting~ AND..,1
970,no one posted the DMM anchor failures video- I'm amazed! I rarely ever clip the racking 'biner directly (almost always use an alpine draw- either fully extended or folded)~ so snagless racking 'biners aren't really worth the investment for me,1
971,However~ for all of my alpine draws~ I will be upgrading both 'biners from neutrinos to snagless keylock DMM Chimeras,2
972,Clipping and unclipping cam slings with neutrinos is really my main carabiner pain point,0
973,And based on your feedback here~ my plan is to eventually upgrade my racking Neutrinos to Photons and accept the (very minute) risk that in the off-chance I clipped the racking 'biner directly and fell~ it might somehow land on the thin/sharpish spot I originally asked about,1
974,I might just stick with Neutrinos since I just got an MM Cadillac and now have 2 extra gear loops...,2
975,I actually find the reverse true...I can't stand a notched biner for racking,0
976,Nothing worse than being all scrunched up under a roof and having a racking biner get snagged on my gear loops,0
977,and this is yet another plus for the Dyon..,2
978,To my recollection~ the Chimera has a VERY wide nose~ which scrunches everything on the harness~ ugh,0
979,I use Dyon's exclusively for racking biners~ as well as the bolt/gear side of all my alpine draws (I think the weight penalty is worth having the Alpha Sport for the rope end of alpine draws),2
980,I seem to never see Chimera for less than $10/ea~ whereas the Dyon can typically be found for about $8-$8.50/ea~ which made a substantial difference when I bought  ~100 of them,1
981,Final point for the Dyon~ there is NO biner that snags less than a dyon~ period.,2
982,Totally agree with the Dyon nose design being both innovative and effective,2
983,I think I have 25 or so,1
984,I do like the Chimera/Phantom size for alpine draws,2
985,If I'm on a route requiring 10-12 draws~ I am probably wearing a gear sling for my nuts/cams~ with all of my harness gear loops open for draws~ I don't really worry about the width of the biner...but I did measure these with a caliper at the widest part of the nose that would have to go through a wire or bolt~ not the rope bearing surface,1
986,Dyon:  5.5mm Hotwire:  9mm Chimera:  12mm Photon:  8.5mm Phantom:  6mm Spirit:  7mm,1
987,just another 'I use to use photons~ but have now mostly switched to dyons and love it' user,2
988,Only con is the photons are cheaper I guess~ but before I discovered the dyons~ photons were my top choice,0
989,Edit: I've also treid heiums~ cause a friend raved~ but i'm not a big fan: Not enough colors~ 2 of mine got sticky gates now~ often find the nose doesn't fit through anchor chains~ and they take up noticebly more space on the gear loop..,0
990,EditEdit: Also~ I've come across some anchors before in which I would fir nothing but a photon,0
991,Cray,1
992,EditEditEidt: Ranting about my irrelevant gear preferences is nice~ haven't got to do that with any friends in a number of weeks....,1
993,I use the Photons on the rope side of my alpines and have loved them so far,2
994,I've put roughly 200 pitches and plenty of whips on them; no issues,2
995,I prefer snagless biners for racking and mostly use Hoodwires~ but I also have some Heliums~ Anges and Dyons,2
996,Heliums are probably my favorite but they don't come in enough colors and are super pricey,0
997,I extend almost every placement but after making a few desperate direct clips in the Creek~ I wouldn't feel confident in such skinny racking biner,0
998,Noticing how the biner would have been levered against the crack I was super happy to have a thicker Hoodwire there,2
999,The Photons are so long and thin it wouldn't take much to snap them,0
1000,Obviously no biner is intended to be levered but I think the Photons are particularly weak in this regard,0
1001,And that's the last thing I want to have in my mind as I'm pulling some desperate moves over them,0
1002,I actually find the reverse true...I can't stand a notched biner for racking,0
1003,Nothing worse than being all scrunched up under a roof and having a racking biner get snagged on my gear loops,0
1004,Buck- so interesting- I always thought I'd find notched racking 'biners annoying too~ but until very recently~ never once had one snag on me- under a roof~ or otherwise! Lately I've been trying to rack gates-out (for harambe!)~ and experienced my first ever snag on a racking 'biner this way (caught my harness),0
1005,I love how gates-out feels on the ground~ but when I'm pumped and fumbling for gear~ it always ends up more arduous for me,0
1006,Guess I'm just a 'gates-in' kinda guy since I learned that way and I'll just have to except the chiding from my friends...,1
1007,Totally agree with the Dyon nose design being both innovative and effective,2
1008,I think I have 25 or so,1
1009,I do like the Chimera/Phantom size for alpine draws,2
1010,If I'm on a route requiring 10-12 draws~ I am probably wearing a gear sling for my nuts/cams~ with all of my harness gear loops open for draws~ I don't really worry about the width of the biner...but I did measure these with a caliper at the widest part of the nose that would have to go through a wire or bolt~ not the rope bearing surface,1
1011,Dyon:  5.5mm Hotwire:  9mm Chimera:  12mm Photon:  8.5mm Phantom:  6mm Spirit:  7mm This is so helpful when visualizing/comparing! Do you have a WC Helium you could measure too?,1
1012,This is so helpful when visualizing/comparing! Do you have a WC Helium you could measure too?  https://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2017/09/13/comparison-review-lightweight-snag-free-carabiners/,1
1013,Christian- agreed~ Chimera seems wide~ but I always keep alpine draws racked on my back loop by themselves and can comfortably fit at least 6 on each side~ plus one quickdraw each (14 total alpine+sport draws)- usually more than enough,0
1014,Plus I have my belay device and a locker for tethering on the back-right and my anchor sling/cordalette on the back-left~ so that's 9 total biners on each back loop,1
1015,9 'biners isn't horribly cramped~ but that's with Neutrinos..,2
1016,I wonder if switching to Chimeras would make it a problem~ and perhaps I should consider the Heliums? I don't like the way the DMM Trad Alpha's kinked spine feels in your hand and I don't love the Dyons either,0
1017,The only problem with Heliums is they don't come in a non-racking color~ which is why I'm leaning towards gunmetal colored Chimeras~ but they're fucking $15 each (!!!) and I'd need like 34 of them..,1
1018,ouch!,1
1019,https://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2017/09/13/comparison-review-lightweight-snag-free-carabiners/ I literally have this bookmarked~ didn't realize it had measurements! I just saw the weight in the table and the helpful pictures,1
1020,Thanks dude!,1
1021,This is so helpful when visualizing/comparing! Do you have a WC Helium you could measure too?  Sorry Dude~ for some reason the MN is a wasteland for WC gear,1
1022,Thanks for sharing Matt,1
1023,I totally agree this is all a matter of preference~ that's why I don't just go with cheap and functional Dyons,1
1024,And ditto about just having fun- especially with trad,1
1025,I'm way more willing to push grade into the 11's on bolts~ but l'm kind of a weakling trad gumby (just shy of 2 years experience) and I don't enjoy climbing much harder than 5.9~ though I'm getting better all the time,1
1026,I too need all the help I can get.,1
1027,How much have you clipped Alpha trad/sport in the real world? The only reason I have them is the bent spine~ I found that I can lock it into my hand much more securely- obviously each UX is different but I was never able to ensure security every single time with a straight spine~ as there's nothing to catch my hand on...vs the Alpha Sport has not only the bent spine but also ribs to grip~ along with the nice bent gate to slam the rope through,1
1028,Heliums are nice and all~ but just too tough to get them less than $10/ea and the nose size limits it's versatility vs the Dyon~ which helped me make the wholesale switch,1
1029,Agree w/ Matt that they are almost as good to clip as the Alpha Sport though..,1
1030,;),1
1031,gonna point out another aspect that no one else has mentioned so far,1
1032,i've noticed Photons seem to have a higher tendency to get into crossload orientations w the clipped rope~ esp across its gate~ more so than most other biners,1
1033,i've climbed with people who owned them~ saw that many times i first noticed it out at JTree~ on multiple occasions that one day,1
1034,seemed and felt like too often,1
1035,then one time a borrowed rack for Indian Creek happened to come w numerous Photons~ so i played w them at home,1
1036,i simply rigged a sling on the high back of a barstool w a Photon to clip a rope into~ and flicked rope around w hand at various angles~ no diff than the way a clipped rope commonly moves around due to typical leader or belayer movements,1
1037,i could easily flip that biner to have its gate rest on the rope or sling and stay that way,1
1038,harder to do this with other biners,1
1039,very difficult to do this w the WC Helium~ another lightweight wiregate~ which i happen to have many due to other favorable factors beyond that~ i've done no formal studies on this,1
1040,if someone gives me access to a lab and a blank check~ sure~ i could put in some research hrs,1
1041," but i think there is such a thing as ""too light"" for some biner uses say hypothetically one could make biners out of a miracle material that's light as paper and still strong as aluminum",1
1042,everyone can see how that could be a bad idea in some situations~ right?  i mean~ with a biner that could get re-oriented by the faintest tug or a mere light breeze~ or could now get into and stay at previously impossible orientations bec it no longer has much heft~ like literally as flimsy as a paper biner cutout~ that should lead to some nervous concerns anyway~ i pointed this out to 3 people at the time,1
1043,told them what i had noticed~ but that they ought to check that out too and see for themselves,1
1044,2 have many Photons on their rack~ and 1 was considering switching to them,1
1045,they all ended up going w another option and i'm sure Photons do excel in some other aspects,1
1046,not saying they're bad in every way or anything like that,1
1047,am quite happy w other Camp biners that i own,1
1048,Last year I needed to swap out my first set of sport draws; it was around my birthday~ so I ran the numbers and figured an extra $100 over 12 cheap draws and I could get the Alpha Sport (on sale for $18 or less~ IIRC),1
1049,I treated myself,1
1050,They're pretty dang sweet and will last a long~ long time (don't sport enough to actually wear biners out~ it seems - dogbone age does it).,1
1051," Good point~ totally anecdotal~ but I have also noted that the light weight biners seem to get in bad loading configurations much more easily than what I would call ""Old School"" carabiners",1
1052,Some perspective on carabiner sizes...BITD~ most people used the BD ovals as the standard.,1
1053,you carry seventeen draws for single pitch devil's lake routes~ plus extra shoulder length?,1
1054,Don't you???,1
1055,Dude you're the best this is so helpful,1
1056,I just bought 18 DMM Chimeras for the gear end,1
1057,Stoked!,1
1058," forgot if I mentioned it in an earlier post but a reminder that lowering in guide mode (JARED!!!! ;) is rather difficult with many of the ""snagless"" biners...but the dyon works with every single device~ even the gigajul (has a rather restrictive opening)~ so might be worth having at least one on the harness for that possibility.",1
1059,Don't you??? On a lot of alpine pitches this is the norm,1
1060,Also quasi alpine routes too,1
1061,P2 of Physical Graffiti in Red Rocks is 180+ feet,1
1062,18 alpine draws would be a piece every 10 feet which if you fell plugging your next piece could be 20 foot whips each time,1
1063,Similarly P3 of R&D in Leavenworth~ WA has almost a full 70m pitch AKA even bigger falls,1
1064,These are really easy routes~ so it's more acceptable to run it out and carry less slings~ but point is~ 17 sounds like lot but it's not!,1
1065,FWIW~ I carry 14 draws (12 alpine/2 quickdraws) even on short trad routes (70-100')~ since I never know what side I'll want to pull them off,1
1066,Granted~ I'm only about 2 yrs deep into the trad game and when I'm pumped~ I'm not the best at switching hands to access the other side of my harness~ but getting better,1
1067,Never discount the over the head sling with one biner on it,1
1068,Sling it with one biner and you can clip it directly to the racking biner on your cam,1
1069,A few extra slings are not heavy~ and they can also be used to sling chicken heads or tie off pitons,1
1070,Am I the only one who carries some slings with single carabiners over the shoulder for extending cams? For the OP: Photons are nice~ I've only had mine for ~8 months though so can't speak to their longevity,1
1071,Getting them caught on gear loops has been a non-issue with a BD harness~ and I clip gates out,1
1072,I could see it potentially being more of a problem with less-plasticized gear loops like those on Petzl harnesses~ but I've never used such a harness,1
1073,Edit: Oh~ hey Buck.,1
1074,Thread Jack:,1
1075,Thread Jack: Haven't seen them in real life,1
1076,Looks like they still have a bit of a tack at the stitching though~ so wouldn't be as nice for alpines as the Mammut's.,1
1077,Haven't seen them in real life,1
1078,Looks like they still have a bit of a tack at the stitching though~ so wouldn't be as nice for alpines as the Mammut's,1
1079,The Mammut Contact is my default~ although it is because they handle so nice~ not because of the little piece of fabric covering the joint,1
1080,Never discount the over the head sling with one biner on it,1
1081,Sling it with one biner and you can clip it directly to the racking biner on your cam,1
1082,A few extra slings are not heavy~ and they can also be used to sling chicken heads or tie off pitons,1
1083,I do this on single pitch only when I know I'm going to have a good stance or if I can read the route from below,1
1084,Sometimes the position you're in when you need to plug pro makes it hard to swap hands to take the sling off your shoulder (e.g,1
1085,in dihedrals),1
1086,Like if you have the sling over your right shoulder~ across your chest~ and under your left armpit,1
1087,If your left hand is jammed you can't get it off your shoulder unless you're able to swap to a right jam,1
1088,Sometimes you can just make one more move up the crack to free the left arm~ but sometimes it's right before the crux.,1
1089,Yep~ I have one from Yates,1
1090,I think it is in a bin downstairs...,1
1091,Yep~ I have one from Yates,1
1092,I think it is in a bin downstairs..,1
1093,Dude I totally agree in theory~ I definitely think I just need more experience,1
1094,I'm just kinda bad at route finding,1
1095,"I'm the best in my friend group when it comes to trail finding on a hike/backpack~ and in the city~ I'm told I have an ""internal GPS""~ but when it comes to anticipating whats 30' ahead of me on a route~ I have a hard time visualizing the moves before I reach them",1
1096,I can accurately gauge cam size~ but I'm still working on anticipating what my exact body positioning will be,1
1097,Getting better all the time~ but sometimes I struggle.,1
1098,Never done it with a rabbit runner~ but I usually carry a couple 120 cm slings over the shoulder like that,1
1099,Definitely the best way to rack them.,1
1100,Like if you have the sling over your right shoulder~ across your chest~ and under your left armpit,1
1101,If your left hand is jammed you can't get it off your shoulder unless you're able to swap to a right jam,1
1102,Sometimes you can just make one more move up the crack to free the left arm~ but sometimes it's right before the crux,1
1103,Here's my solution: Don't put slings OVER your head and arm,1
1104,Use double length slings and wrap them AROUND your neck and arms and clip with a single biner down by your waist/under your arm,1
1105,When it's time to use just unclip the 'biner from one end with whatever hand and pull the sling straight away,1
1106,both hands can reach it,1
1107,No struggle,1
1108,I usually do about 4 60 cm slings w/ a biner over the shoulder and 4 alpines on both sides of my harness,1
1109,I can always extend whatever piece I need by just pulling extenders from the most convenient area.Never had any issues with that system - especially on easier terrain,1
1110,It must be a Minnesota thing~ Sam...I do the same thing,1
1111,Alpine draws on the hips~ a couple slings over my head with one biner on it,1
1112,omg twinsies!,1
1113,The thing is~ most people don't even carry enough protection to support 17 draws~ regardless of the route or pitch length,1
1114,I agree,1
1115,I have done a couple of routes where we linked pitches,1
1116,Longest was about 175 feet (Empor~ Cob Rock) I think I placed about 12 pieces,1
1117,But there aren't that many routes that require a lot of gear the entire way,1
1118,Most pitches have cruxes~ and then ease off,1
1119,I don't require gear every 10 feet if the grade is only 5.3,1
1120,And a lot of my cams have a sling already on them~ so I only need the racking biner,1
1121,But there are routes where you can sling a tree or a chicken head~ or a thread~ or a Chockstone,1
1122,That is when you want to have an extra sling or three,1
1123,Go lighter on gear~ heavier on the soft goods.,1
1124,Hey shoutout to everyone that shared their insight on this thread,1
1125,Just got back from my first weekend climbing with my new DMM Chimeras on the gear end of my runners,1
1126,They're awesome~ I knew it would make a difference~ but I didn't expect it to be so drastic,1
1127,And they're super lightweight!  Maybe I'll update my racking biners one day..,1
1128,Thanks again~ all!,1
1129,Wow~ that must have set you back a nickel or so....nice work,1
1130,What's a reasonable way to carry 4 doubles? One maybe two around the chest~ I can't imagine climbing with them tripled over like alpines and not getting them stuck on things,1
1131,So what's your method?,1
1132,What's a reasonable way to carry 4 doubles? One maybe two around the chest~ I can't imagine climbing with them tripled over like alpines and not getting them stuck on things,1
1133,So what's your method? I personally only carry one double~ and not all the time~ but I take it and double it and then make an alpine draw the normal way,1
1134,The only way this will really work is if you are using the ultra thin 8mm slings,1
1135,I only have nylon doubles...pic on the left is 240cm sling and a nylon 120cm,1
1136,Right is 240cm sling and 7.5ft cordalette(same length as sling),1
1137,What's a reasonable way to carry 4 doubles? One maybe two around the chest~ I can't imagine climbing with them tripled over like alpines and not getting them stuck on things,1
1138,So what's your method? Drape them over your shoulder and then clip with a carabiner at your waist,1
1139,That way to pull them you don't have to go over your arm and head,1
1140,Just unclip the carabiner and pull the sling through,1
1141,I usually carry about 4 that way,1
1142,I personally only carry one double~ and not all the time~ but I take it and double it and then make an alpine draw the normal way,1
1143,The only way this will really work is if you are using the ultra thin 8mm slings,1
1144,I only have nylon doubles...pic on the left is 240cm sling and a nylon 120cm,1
1145,Right is 240cm sling and 7.5ft cordalette(same length as sling) How is that cordalette tied? I'm sick of my mangled mess and that looks compact.,1
1146,How is that cordalette tied? I'm sick of my mangled mess and that looks compact,1
1147,There is probably a YouTube video somewhere...I wouldn't know how to go about describing it,1
1148,The gist is you build a series of loops (knot at top) and wrap the cord upwards until you can pass th strand through the loop formed at the top,1
1149,Sounds like a challenge.,1
1150,Thanks dude! I YouTubed it and it was very surprisingly the 1st thing that popped up,1
1151,While we’re in the minutiae of sling and cord storage~ my favorite way to carry a double-length is to make it an alpine draw as usual~ then twist one of the carabiners once or twice and clip it to the other,1
1152,- compact~ doesn’t hang lower than other draws - no fussing around neck/shoulder - can still be deployed and extended one-handed with same method as single-length draw (clip one end to you piece~ unclip other carabiner and nab single strand of sling~ pull to extend),1
1153,Thanks dude! I YouTubed it and it was very surprisingly the 1st thing that popped up Any chance you could post a link to that video?,1
1154,Hey guys ! I have a complet rack of c4 from .3to4,1
1155,Now i doubled the number 1 one with c4 and doubled .4 .5 .75 with the WC friemds ~that i really appreciate,1
1156,Now its time for me to buy some smallest one,1
1157,And im pretty confuse on which one to choose,1
1158,Heard of drangonfly ~ or kailas cam and the z4,1
1159,Someone have use this cam and can tell me what the tought about it ? Thx,1
1160,for little cams i have totems (black and blue are small) and alien revolutions,1
1161,totems are more secure but much heavier (and expensive)~ and they don't go as small (but i don't climb hard enough to really need anything smaller than a black totem).,1
1162,Find some TCUs or powercams for cheap (25-35/cam) and use those until you feel like you need something different,1
1163,I like mine a lot more than c4s up through the .4 C4 size.,1
1164,The black totem (about a .2 c4) is one of the most confidence inspiring cams on my rack,1
1165,The holding power especially in less than ideal placements is pretty impressive,1
1166,That said~ it depends on how small you wanna go,1
1167,If you need anything smaller than a black totem I would go with the z4s,1
1168,Yes but its impossible to find this black totems hahaha,1
1169,Yes but its impossible to find this black totems hahaha They have them on the totem website,1
1170,They have them on the totem website With the shipping in canada the black one cost me 160$ haha,1
1171,Didn't I see some TCUs in the FS forum a few days ago? Cheap too IIRC.,1
1172,Can you explain what this means?  Not understanding what climbing hard has to do with cam size.,1
1173,Can you explain what this means?  Not understanding what climbing hard has to do with cam size,1
1174,The harder the crack the thinner they tend to be I think is what he meant,1
1175,The harder the crack the thinner they tend to be I think is what he meant  There are loads of easy routes that you can use smaller cams on,1
1176,A tiny crack may be the only option for gear regardless of how difficult the route is,1
1177,Why limit your options,1
1178,Small cams are the most useful cams~ you can never fit a larger cam in a small crack but you can sometimes fit a small cam in the back of a large crack,1
1179,I’ve never understood the mentality that ”I don’t climb hard enough to use micro cams”,1
1180,It means you don’t have a good imagination when it comes protection.,1

1186,It means you don’t have a good imagination when it comes protection,1
1187,I agree~ but how many times have you placed a 00 or 000 c3 on a 5.10?,1
1188,I agree~ but how many times have you placed a 00 or 000 c3 on a 5.10? Quite a few times,1
1189,I’d rather be able to place a 000 C3 than nothing,1
1190,People seem to think that it might not hold a fall so why place it?  It just might hold your fall so why not place it?   Larger gear is great if you can get it but sometimes micro cams or wires are all that is available so why not use it?,1
1191,I agree~ but how many times have you placed a 00 or 000 c3 on a 5.10? Shoot I climbed 4 routes in a row one day where the first two pieces were 00 and 000 to protect the first 50ft,1
1192,These were 5.8 lines,1
1193,Slabby,1
1194,Fun~ not bolted,1
1195,Metoleus TCUs.,1
1196,I  just got a full set of z4s (and the offsets),1
1197,Even though I've only used them once~ they were awesome and a great addition to my rack,1
1198,Prob won't ever leave home without some of them ever again.,1
1199,the new BD z4s are pretty sweet,1
1200,I have then down to a .3 but i've played around with the .2 and .1~ Very nice cams,1
1201,The new generation aliens are the ideal small cams to me,1
1202,Very flexible~ small head width~ and the fact that they offer the doubled sling makes them my first choice.,1
1203,If you need anything smaller than a black totem~ ball nuts are pretty great,1
1204,And they are stronger than equivalent sized cams,1
1205,With the shipping in canada the black one cost me 160$ haha https://shop.climbonsquamish.com/totem-cam.html?id=12220919,1
1206,.1 size or smaller: I've only used for aid,1
1207,Haven't needed for free climbing,1
1208,Harder to place correctly due to small range~ and sometimes not as strong or pulls out easier than bigger cams,1
1209,.2 size,1
1210,(The Smallest the Totem comes in~ the Black one) Totem: holds very well,1
1211,Good in parrelel and flared cracks,1
1212,Expensive,1
1213,Bulky,1
1214,The following are all inspired by CCH Aliens: BD Z4 (replaced the X4),1
1215,New,1
1216,Not a lot of reviews on Z4s yet~ mixed reviews on X4s,1
1217,Metolius Master Cams,1
1218,Best Value,1
1219,Inexpensive,1
1220,Lacks a tumb loop,1
1221,DMM DragonFlies~ a favorite of some people Fixe Alien Revolutions~ a favorite of some people All of the above applies to .3 to .5 or.75 as well,1
1222,Go to a good gear shop and play with all of them,1
1223,Everyone has different preferences,1
1224,Of course climbing with them is even better if you have partners with different brands.,1
1225,I agree~ but how many times have you placed a 00 or 000 c3 on a 5.10? Every time I see something like this~ all I can think is how charmed a climbing life so many people live,1
1226,Around here a .4 is a standard midsize cam (and the most placed piece on my rack—I carry 3),1
1227,Every time I see something like this~ all I can think is how charmed a climbing life so many people live,1
1228,Around here a .4 is a standard midsize cam (and the most placed piece on my rack—I carry 3),1
1229,damn dude thats hardcore,1
1230,Z4s go to a double axle/double twisted cable from .3 up~ which changes them a fair bit,1
1231,They're the only double axles of the ones you've listed.,1
1232," Doesn't this belong in ""climbing gear discussion"" not ""climbing gear reviews""?",1
1233,If it’s worth anything~ I’ve felt totems are a tad overhyped (I’ve only used a few times and don’t own)~ but my .2 and .1 X4’s are my favorite pieces,1
1234,Not sure how others feel but I’ve whipped on both a number of times~ up to some 25-30 footers (nice soft catches) and trust them totally,1
1235,They place well and the flexible stem is nice,1
1236,With new Z4’s being sold out and expensive~ if you can find small x4’s cheap totally grab them~ I love then,1
1237,Totems are great in pin scars~ flared cracks and pods~ if most of your climbing is parallel sided cracks then there really is no added benefit~ any old cam will suffice in that case.,1
1238,Totems are great in pin scars~ flared cracks and pods~ if most of your climbing is parallel sided cracks then there really is no added benefit~ any old cam will suffice in that case,1
1239,That was probably a better way to say it~ “rock around me ain’t built for totems”,1
1240,https://shop.climbonsquamish.com/totem-cam.html?id=12220919 In stock at verticallstore.com in Québec,1
1241,Totems are great in pin scars~ flared cracks and pods~ if most of your climbing is parallel sided cracks then there really is no added benefit~ any old cam will suffice in that case,1
1242,If you take a totem and an equivalent sized BD cam and place them both into a somewhat flared crack~ the totems holding power is so much better its almost like a totally different tool,1
1243,Just seeing if anyone out there has had some experience with the Evolv Supra~ mainly with sizing,1
1244,I've owned a pair of Evolv shoes in the past~ the luchador's~ and needed to size up a full size from my street shoes 11.5 to a 12.5,1
1245,I've read things online of people sizing up a half to a full~ buying them in their street shoe size~ or even going small than their street shoe size,1
1246,Looking for any advice as well as the performance and fit of the shoes,1
1247,Cheers,1
1248,So I'm in the market for a ledge,1
1249,WAS going to Yosemite next month but that is in limbo...,1
1250,but not gonna stop training (at home) or give up on the dream,1
1251,The parks will reopen! Soon hopefully..,1
1252,anyways There's a lot out there~ where do I begin First~ is there any reason for a single portaledge?  Usually you bring a partner they need a spot to sleep right?  Can 2 single ledges join together? Or stack like bunks?  Or do u buy a single and expect that most big wallers have their own single too?,1
1253,A5/D4 Alpine Double is basically the standard though they may be a little tricky to find at the moment,1
1254,Single ledges are great for soloing,1
1255,Things have likely changed in the last ten years~ but at that time the Fish seemed to be the easiest to set up,1
1256,Always wished I would have been patient and bought one as they take a couple months to make~ but were the same price,1
1257,Where the cromoly steel fittings on the Fish just slide right in~ the BD fittings are tough,1
1258,The BD is super heavy and sucks to set up,1
1259,Nowadays~ I think I’d buy the inflatable one if I were in the market,1
1260,Better yet~ just sleep on natural ledges or do it in a push,1
1261,I have a Runout Customs Double~ actually it's their Baffin Ledge with is just an extra large double and I have a D4 Trapezium,1
1262,Customs is super comfortable and fairly easy to set up and breakdown,1
1263,For multi day walls its the way to go,1
1264,For one or two night walls I like Trapezium~ super easy set up like about a minute,1
1265,The downside is breaking it down and getting it into its original bag~ its not intuitive,1
1266,Practice makes perfect but I'm too impatient to practice and its easier to complain about it than to actually spend the time and learn to break it down correctly,1
1267,I ended up just getting a larger haul bag for it,1
1268,I'd check out D4 https://bigwallgear.com/ ~ John invented the portaledge and is the only person I know of to make one design and the completely change it,1
1269,That kind of deep knowledge and innovation probably bodes well for his products.,1
1270,Hard for me to say,1
1271,I wouldn't suggest buying a used ledge as your first ledge if you can afford a new one,1
1272,Better to learn on something where you don't have to always question if the issue was the eledge or the condition you got it in,1
1273,That said~ if money is tight~ used ledges are the way to go,1
1274,Find someone with experience to help you judge a ledge you're going to buy if possible,1
1275,We can usually tell from photos if it'll get you up at least one wall~ but caveat emptor.,1
1276,Completely false...,1
1277,the portaledge was in use DECADES before Jon starting making them,1
1278,He wasn't even the first in the US~ as that crown probably goes to Stonemaster Mike Graham of Gramicci.,1
1279,I'm obviously biased~ but after FISH~ I would go with a used anything~ but make sure the fly is cherry,1
1280,They are hard to get replacements for and are super pricey if you need a new one~ and that's if you can find one,1
1281,Plus if you buy from Russ (Russ is FISH) you can get a Snakecharmer while you're at it~ one of the best rope bags for walls in the business,1
1282,Then get some of his Beef Bags~ the best for your 2:1 kit,1
1283,Then get some of his Wall Bags~ some of the best wall bags out there,1
1284,Then get two Doubloons~ the rivet hanger you didn't know you needed until you really really do.,1
1285,I think choice of ledge should be informed by your target routes,1
1286,For routes with ledges that are good enough to hang out on but not good enough to sleep on~ I can't recommend the G7 enough,1
1287,I did the Nose in a party of 3 last year~ and we ended up having a double ledge and a prototype G7,1
1288,While my partners faffed and struggled to get their cliff cabana together~ I was phatty chilling with a sandwich and a doob,1
1289,The G7 is super comfortable for sleeping and weighs so little that using it seems like a no-brainer.,1
1290,Hey everybody~  I was wondering if anyone had any experience getting a no-edge shoe (LS Futura/genius/maverink) resoled with an edge,1
1291,I currently have two pairs of futura's and one desperately needs a resole~ and the novelty of having it resoled with an edge seems interesting,1
1292,I'm just not sure how it would affect performance,1
1293,I'm currently climbing on granite/metamorphic sandstone so it seemed like it could potentially be beneficial.,1
1294,Try it,1
1295,Worst case scenario it’ll be “no edge” in a few weeks anyways,1
1296,;),1
1297,I resoled my futuras with vibram grip2 rubber once and really liked it,1
1298,Essentially they became a pair of Python's with a more snug fit and better heel.,1
1299,I have some futuras that have had two resoles~ each time with an edge,1
1300,I didn't really do it by choice but no resoler near me has the no edge materials,1
1301,They climb pretty similarly~ maybe a little less sensitive for a while but it doesn't change the shoe too much,1
1302,Honestly I wouldn't do it intentionally~ but if its whats available~ its fine.,1
1303,I would call up Rock and Resole and see what they think - they're an authorized  La Sportiva repair shop.,1
1304,You can resole them with an edge or no edge,1
1305,There is a video out there by La sportiva saying that people resole them with an edge and they work fine.,1
1306,Just used some liquid chalk a friend gave me for the first time,1
1307,It appears to be hand sanitizer and chalk in one! Plus~ my woody and the room in my house it's in won't get all dusty! Don't know how much it costs or if it works,1
1308,Hope you are staying active during this!,1
1309,Yes~ this is one of the strategies gyms have identified for when they reopen.,1
1310,You can make it yourself in two minutes at like 5% the cost of buying some from friction labs,1
1311,It’s literally just powdered chalk and isopropyl alcohol,1
1312,Mix until toothpaste consistency,1
1313,Be careful using liquid chalk on your woody,1
1314,Be careful using liquid chalk on your woody risk of dry fire is real,1
1315," Needs to be at least 70% Isopropyl alcohol..( aka ""rubbing alcohol"") or 70% Ethyl Alcohol for anti-bacterial / anti-viral",1
1316,Yes~ both should burn nicely if ignited~ but I've never tried it,1
1317,The vapors from both will explode nicely (especially the ethyl alcohol) if the fumes get to the right concentration (like if you're making a 'big batch' in your basement or kitchen) and a spark / flame is in the vicinity.,1
1318,Old news,1
1319,And maybe not that helpful from a contact perspective but maybe more so by keeping down dust.https://www.gymclimber.com/can-liquid-chalk-protect-climbers-from-coronavirus-as-gyms-begin-to-reopen/,1
1320,I have owned several chalk bags made by Tufa~ and Josh Kornish is a great guy to work with,1
1321,I am psyched that Josh is now making packs,1
1322,In short~ the Tufa Mochilla is the best pack for climbing day trips I have ever used,1
1323,Over the past 20 years~ I have used packs from Black Diamond~ Wild Things~ Osprey~ Hyperlite Mountain Gear~ ZPacks~ Patagonia~ Grivel~ and others,1
1324,I now own 3 Tufa Mochillas,1
1325,The first Mochilla I bought for my wife~ and it is the ultralight Hybrid Cuben Fiber version here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-pack-cuben-fiber-hybrid-2-92-oz The Hybrid Cuben Fiber version is intended for ultralight applications~ and it is advertised with its limitations:  Note:  This pack is built from 2.92 oz Cuben Fiber hybrid fabric,1
1326,This  is a highly specialized pack for ultralight endeavors,1
1327,While not meant  to be hauled or heavily abraided~ this pack will last several seasons  with proper care,1
1328,In spite of these limitations~ my wife found that it carried so well that she wanted to use it as her daily climbing pack,1
1329,As such~ we have now put over 100 days on it doing everything from using it as a chest pack while bouldering in the rhododendron thickets of North Carolina to approaching the splitters of Indian Creek,1
1330,It is just now starting to show some signs of wear on the bottom panel:  So I now own two more Mochillas in the MUCH more durable D40 fabric: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-roll-top-limited-edition-d40 In addition to being made with a more durable fabric~ the D40 Mochilla has a rolltop rather than a drawcord closure at the top,1
1331,After putting about 30 days on each of our D40 packs~ they still look remarkably new:   Note that the packs above contain absolutely everything the two of us need to go trad cragging~ including a 60m rope inside the pack on the left,1
1332,Here are these packs' contents:  The Mochilla is a fairly simple pack,1
1333,It comes standard as a tube with shoulder straps and sternum strap~ small tab loops for a helmet~ a small zippered pocket between the shoulder blades~ two haul loops~ a rope strap~ and a removable foam back pad,1
1334,It can be made with either a draw cord top closure or a roll top,1
1335,I prefer the roll top,1
1336,It comes with a removable waist belt that I do not use,1
1337,My favorite thing about the pack is how well it carries when hiking and climbing,1
1338,The bottom rides just above my harness~ and the top is low enough that it doesn't interfere with looking up if I am wearing a helmet:  Even when hauling a helmet and rope on the outside~ it carries well:  The pack features haul loops that are actually big enough to use with gloves,1
1339,The pocket is just big enough for a phone~ headlamp~ keys~ and maybe a couple Gu packs:  I had Josh add an extra rope strap tab to mine above the pocket,1
1340,The back pad is removable and remarkably effective at giving the pack support:  Josh can do some customizations if you ask,1
1341,For example~ he can add traditional loops to the bottom of the pack for ice tools~ though he is currently working on a more modern solution,1
1342,He added an additional rope strap catch above the pocket on mine so that the rope strap didn't interfere with getting into the pocket,1
1343,He is considering offering a folding back pad that would be long enough to use as a torso bivy pad,1
1344,Daisy chains can be added,1
1345,Here is a video of packing mine for a day of trad cragging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=God1nw12Yzo&feature=youtu.be The standard Mochilla is $119~ and it comes in a few different fabric and construction options here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/peaksa-clim The ultralight Hybrid Cuben Mochilla is $165~ weighs 11.6 ounces~ and can be found here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-pack-cuben-fiber-hybrid-2-92-oz The burly as hell D40 Mochilla is $165~ weighs 14.9 ounces~ and can be found here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-roll-top-limited-edition-d40,1
1346,I have the same white X-Pac mochilla,1
1347,Had him make me one way back that was 1000D cordura,1
1348,the new one has such good updates~ the roll top~ the pocket on back~ the straps~ it's so good,1
1349,However~ the best thing about this pack~ above all other packs~ it fits so ergonomically,1
1350,I have a pack fetish,1
1351,I have a BD Zip 24~ a CCW Valdez~ and a slew of other common multipitch backs~ the TUFA is amazing,1
1352,Can confirm the above~ I love mine for car to car alpine climbs.,1
1353,Brian~ Thank you for taking the time and effort to do a thorough review on the Mochilla,1
1354,You and Dana have your systems dialed and I'm psyched the Mochilla has been serving you well,1
1355,The Cuben Fiber pack you have was the first production pack and it's cool to hear it's taken some serious abuse from the thickets to the desert,1
1356,Designing a single pack that excels at both technical climbing and hiking has been my primary project for the last four years; your feedback and suggestions have been incredibly valuable in this process,1
1357,I modified the webbing lengths and I'll be adding a double length bivy pad option to the site soon,1
1358,I'm also working on a bottom reinforcement for the Cuben packs,1
1359,"The ""roll-top"" closure is definitely the way to go",1
1360," I actually use it more as a ""flap"" closure which is super quick~ easy~ and secure:   Always happy to do simple modifications to the Mochilla and talk ideas",1
1361,The Mountain project community has been integral to the development of this pack and I'm incredibly grateful for the community support,1
1362,Thanks again~ y'all!   Happy climbing~ Josh,1
1363,I have the same white X-Pac mochilla,1

1402,Keep it up,1
1403,Thank you for your support~ Squiddo!,1
1404,Just finished up patterning a bottom wrap for the Cuben Fiber Mochilla,1
1405,Hardly any weight gains and the abrasion resistant bottom should keep the Cuben packs going strong,1
1406,I'll post up some photos once I dial it in shortly,1
1407,If anyone has any questions feel free to shoot me a message and I'd be happy to talk gear!,1
1408,Was the naming of these packs purposefully incorrect Spanish?,1
1409,Was the naming of these packs purposefully incorrect Spanish? Ranger~  por supuesto~ parce! :),1
1410,PACK IS EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE,1
1411,For the size~ took a full double rack~ 3L water bladder~ chalk bag~ shoes~ snacks~ keys~ wallet~ phone~ sunscreen,1
1412,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT,1

1415,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT Great shot~ FO!  Psyched the Mochilla is crushing it! <3,1
1416,Update based on Brian's suggestions,1
1417,I added a Double Length Bivy Pad to the Site  Perfect for those wanting extra back padding and a little more comfort on overnight bivies,1
1418,Single length foam insert comes standard with the Mochilla,1
1419,You can upgrade your pad to a double length or you can buy an additional double length pad,1
1420,The single length (standard) is ideal for cragging and multi-pitch climbing,1
1421,The Double length (Upgrade) is ideal for reducing pressure points on the hips and shoulders when lying down or insulating from the cold ground,1
1422,"Dimensions: 11"" Wide~ 35"" Long (Can be cut down) Weight: ﻿48 grams Made in USA  ",1
1423,Is it two-fa or tough-fa?,1
1424," Nate~ I pronounce it ""Two-fa""~ but I also don't correct people when I hear ""tough-fa"" haha Technical » Unique » Functional » Λrt",1
1425,These look really nice,1
1426,How do the helmet tabs work?,1
1427," Thanks~ Andrew! The helmet tabs are basically two loops~ 1/2"" webbing x 3"" long",1
1428,I thread my helmet buckles through the loops for carrying on approaches,1
1429,Great for those who need two attachment points but not full daisy chains.,1
1430,Couple of new improvements and additions to the D40 Mochilla and X-Pac Mochillas We're adding an elastic web to the 'Ice Daisy' version to hold crampons and extra layers,1
1431,The D40 is extremely durable and crampons won't puncture in the picture configuration,1
1432,The compression straps for the roll-top are going to be tucked in the seam to clean up the design a bit and improve load transfer,1
1433,Thank you for the support everyone~ we really appreciate it! Josh,1
1434,Got to try out my Mochilla (made from the the X-50 material) for the first time yesterday,1
1435,A few hundred feet of scraping up and then rappelling down through tight granite chimneys and dihedrals and nary a scratch,1
1436,It also carries well and the build quality is good,1
1437,Glad to hear you're enjoying your Multicam Mochilla~ Brandon,1
1438,Keep crushing it! I'm working through the last batch of the D40 Mochillas,1
1439,I'm condensing the rock and ice versions into a single daisy chain version better suited to modern tools,1
1440,The rest of the daisy chain packs will ship with elastic webs and tool keepers,1
1441,The rest of the daisy chain packs~ both rock and ice~ will ship with elastic webs,1
1442,Super custom D40 Mochilla going out to a Project member,1
1443,First D40 with a draw-cord shroud and maybe my favorite pack yet,1
1444,Custom strippable vinyl gear loops and other custom options available by request,1
1445,Josh~ question about the name Mochilla,1
1446,Is it pronounced Mo-chill-uh or Mo-chee-yah? Just wondering..,1
1447,Josh~ question about the name Mochilla,1
1448,Is it pronounced Mo-chill-uh or Mo-chee-yah? Just wondering..,1
1449,Mo-chill-uh ;),1
1450,Josh~ Thanks! Was just wondering because of the two L's make a why sound (in Spanish?) thing,1
1451,It would sound odd calling a Gorilla~ a Goreeyah~~~ :-),1
1452,Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify~ Locker,1
1453,:) When you're back in the studio I have some shoes I'd love to have done by the master resoler~ himself,1
1454,Cheers!,1
1455,Josh- My X50 multicam is sweet! Going to really test it good this weekend,1
1456,FFA attempt of 10+ pitches of granite chimney thuggery in Yosemite,1
1457,Will likely haul it several times~ and plan on using the bivy pad,1
1458,I'll report back!,1
1459,Josh- My X50 multicam is sweet! Going to really test it good this weekend,1
1460,FFA attempt of 10+ pitches of granite chimney thuggery in Yosemite,1
1461,Will likely haul it several times~ and plan on using the bivy pad,1
1462,I'll report back! Psyched for you to give it some abuse~ Max!  Sounds like a gnarly project~ go crush it!,1
1463,D40 packs are sold out~ just got a cool new fabric called Lite-Skin 42,1
1464,Super psyched on the Lite Skin series designed by Dimension Polyant,1
1465,A non-woven polyester face laminated on a 420d nylon backing combine to make a lightweight fabric that is abrasion resistant and completely waterproof.,1
1466,Stoked to see josh making more badass stuff! I remember my first tufa chalk bag several years ago!,1
1467,Psyched for you to give it some abuse~ Max!  Sounds like a gnarly project~ go crush it! Beat the living hell out of it,1
1468,Drug it~ hauled it and shiver bivy'd on it,1
1469,Couldn't be happier,1
1470,Love that shot!,1
1471,Been making some small adjustments to the Mochilla design,1
1472,New for Spring 2018: *Improved adjustable sternum strap with four vertical slots for a dialed fit,1
1473,*Roll-top compression straps tucked into seams for a cleaner front,1
1474,*Rounded back panel corners  *Logo tucked into the seam to reduce stitch lines on face fabric,1
1475,Little iterations~ continuous improvement..,1
1476,thank you for your support and feedback~ y'all!,1
1477,Just placed an order~ I’m psyched.,1
1478,Thanks for your support~ Tapawingo!  Finished up your Mochilla~ it'll be there soon!,1
1479,Damn that is sexXxy!,1
1480,Placed my order yesterday!!!,1
1481,Is there a waistbelt option on the mochilla?,1
1482,It comes with a 3/4” webbing waist belt.,1
1483,What's everyone's preference for the rain tight roll closure vs drawstring closure? I would assume the rolltop is best for precipitation (rain/snow) and the drawstring would be best for accessing the bag frequently since it's quicker? I can't decide between the two options..,1
1484,Depends on what you’re using it for,1
1485,I have both~ use the cinch on rock and the roll top in winter alpiney stuff,1
1486,Hey Steve~ I have both,1
1487,I really prefer the drawstring closure~ I feel that it allows the pack to have a little more volume than the roll top,1
1488,If I'm in a situation where the amount of precipitation is enough to penetrate the tiny hole left by the drawstring closure~ I'm going to be soaking wet no matter what I do! The ease of access is a plus as well.,1
1489,Hey Steve~ I have both,1
1490,I really prefer the drawstring closure~ I feel that it allows the pack to have a little more volume than the roll top,1
1491,If I'm in a situation where the amount of precipitation is enough to penetrate the tiny hole left by the drawstring closure~ I'm going to be soaking wet no matter what I do! The ease of access is a plus as well.,1
1492,Hi Josh~ I think you have done a brilliant job of this pack and it’s always exciting to see details that have clearly evolved to suit the task,1
1493,I am interested to know what the D40 fabric offers that~ VX42 does not? (I wondered if it’s being a bit more supple might reduce abrasion?),1
1494,Why do many people seem to prefer the rolltop closure? Is the rope strap tab positioned where it is (below zip) so that it doesn’t put direct strain on the zip? I build a pack with the tab above the zip~ and the zip definitely wore out quicker because of it,1
1495,Great work Josh! Get Outlook for iOS,1
1496,Hey Katie~ Thanks for the kind words~ I'd love to see the pack you made,1
1497,Both the VX-42 and DX-40 are great fabrics,1
1498,The DX-40 face fabric is a blend of polyester and Ultra-PE (Like spectra or Dyneema); it's more tear-resistant than the VX-42 and a bit lighter weight,1
1499,The DX-40 is definitely a bit more supple as well,1
1500,I typically recommend the DX-40 for people in thorny / sharp areas or those wanting the highest performance,1
1501,The Mochilla now has a rope strap tab above the zipper for easy zip access and a strap tab into the frame for carrying heavier loads,1
1502,I haven't had issues with these YKK Aquaguard zippers.,1
1503,Hey Katie~ Thanks for the kind words~ I'd love to see the pack you made,1

1509,I haven't had issues with these YKK Aquaguard zippers,1
1510,Are there any downsides to the D40 or advantages to the VX42? Sounds like the D40 is lighter~ more tear-resistant~ and more supple,1
1511,Is it just more expensive?,1
1512,Andrew~ One of the only downsides I've noticed with experimenting with DX-40 is that the seam strength is a little weaker than the VX-42,1
1513,This is because it's made with a slightly looser poly / dyneema blend vs,1
1514,the VX-42 nylon; not an issue I've had in the real world though,1
1515,I've had great feedback with it over the last 3 or so years I've been using it,1
1516,It's a pricey material for sure,1
1517,The VX-42 option is also a great pack and only an oz or two heavier,1
1518,I really like the white taffeta lining on the VX-42 and DX-40 over the PU coating on the X-50,1
1519,Let me know if that helps,1
1520,Feel free to shoot me a message with any other questions,1
1521,-Josh,1
1522,Just wanted to give a shoutout to Josh and his business,1
1523,I own a Tufa Houdini chalk bag (which I use for every type of climbing that I do) and it’s a great piece of kit,1
1524,It can really help to de-clutter your harness on multipitch climbs,1
1525,I also just received my Tufa Mochilla today~ which I ordered only 14 days ago — super fast turnaround! It looks awesome and I can’t wait to get out with it,1
1526,Check out Josh’s products — in addition to getting best-in-class gear~ you get to support a small~ climber-owned business,1
1527,Thank you~ Joel!  That really means a lot and I appreciate your support,1
1528,Enjoy the pack~ my friend!,1
1529,I’ve been using my VX42 Mochilla down here in Patagonia this season for almost every mission~ and even took it as my only pack on Fitz Roy for 4 days,1
1530,It’s the perfect on-route size and has stood up well to the abuse so far,1
1531,I wish it had a slightly more ergonomic axe-carry system for modern tools~ but other than that I can’t think of a single complaint! Highly recommended!,1
1532,I just took my Mochilla out for it's first day on ice,1
1533,Packed in a few miles with layers~ draws~ screws~ gloves~ etc,1
1534,Had crampons~ rope~ helmet~ and tools on the outside,1
1535,It got all the stuff to the climb and carried it better than expected for such a light pack,1
1536,Then it disappeared on the climb,1
1537,I never thought about it once or felt any strange pinches~ helmet hits~  or shoulder/chest discomfort,1
1538,I really dig the zip pocket location for ease of access at belays,1
1539,I'm really happy with it so far and can't wait to drag it up stuff in Red Rocks next week,1
1540,It is just a well executed clean design that is super functional and well made,1
1541,I'm already confident that I'd buy another one if needed in the future,1
1542,Solid work~ Josh!,1
1543,I bought one custom when this thread started and put my TUFA through the paces and will take it out again this weekend,1
1544,So 3 years of abuse and no sign of it quitting!  Thanks Josh Steve,1
1545,I own 2 Mochilla Packs~ hands down the best daypack I have ever used for leading multi pitch climbs,1
1546,I also really like theTufa Houdini chaulk bag~ incredible design (the best I have seen),1
1547,For me personally I wish you also made a slightly larger size Houdini chaulk bag 1/2” inch wider and 1”inch  deeper~ that would be perfect for me,1
1548,I normally wear size XL gloves,1
1549,Thank you Tufa for making such great products,1
1550,David Katz,1
1551,Ordered mine today! Can't wait! Thanks Josh for all of the Q&A really helped me make a choice :),1
1552,I picked up a pair of these this week.https://www.hmhoutdoors.com/butora/men-s/new-gomi-seagrass---wide-fit/ They are a moderately downturned shoe with very sticky rubber,1
1553,Previously I had tried the Acro but the heel was crushing my Achilles,1
1554,I read how they were moving to a new heel and the Gomi looked like the picture of it so I got one on the chance they would work on my wide forefoot and narrow heel,1
1555,I got them in street shoe size and they are very comfortable,1
1556,Toes bent but not the least bit painful~ heel locked on but no pain like the Acro,1
1557,I’d probably size down 1/2 size if I really wanted a super tight fit,1
1558,I’ve climbed twice in them in the gym and they performed great,1
1559,I purposely picked routes with slim~ slopey polished feet and they stuck on everything,1
1560,Its a softish shoe~ not super soft like a Drago or such but def not a stiff edger,1
1561,The toe is a bit blunter than others so maybe not 10/10 for precision but decent,1
1562,Its also not super downturned so perhaps not the very best for very steep pocketed routes,1
1563,Overall I feel it’s a very solid all around shoe,1
1564,I also like supporting Butora due to being USA based and hire they support USA climbing.,1
1565,I also bought them recently and I am not very happy with them,1
1566,I fit my foot very well and are uncomfortable to climb,1
1567,Greetings,1
1568,I’ve been eyeballing a pair to use in between resoling my dragos,1
1569,The rubber on them is the same neofuse as the Acro right?,1
1570,Yep~ same rubber - and they actually have a new Acro~ with the same redesigned heel as the Gomi,1
1571,Does anyone have an issue with the outer side of the heel cup rubbing too high up on the ankle bone? Wondering if I just need to size down.,1
1572,Yep~ same rubber - and they actually have a new Acro~ with the same redesigned heel as the Gomi,1
1573,Tried the “new Acro heel” on a demo night~ still felt the same as the old Achilles-biting heel,1
1574,The Gomi however was comfortable in that aspect...took quite a while to soften up~ but about 30mins into a session they feel great~ good balance of softness/sensitivity and edging,1
1575,Looking at buying a 70m 9.9mm glider dry rope,1
1576,I can get it for $175 brand new,1
1577,Does anyone have any experience with this particular rope?  It's a signature series bi pattern with Honnolds name associated with it,1
1578,It just seems like a really good deal,1
1579,If not~ what about maxim ropes in general? Any information/experiences with or about Maxim ropes would be greatly appreciated,1
1580,Thanks!,1
1581,They are expensive but durable and generally very well handling,1
1582,It's hard to swallow the price sometimes,1
1583,I mostly buy thinner ropes with out bipattern or dry treatment to save money and have not had many maxim ropes because you can't find many that are not set treated,1
1584,It's what I use for my roped soloing setup~ on about my 10th one...,1
1585,If you do go with the blue 9.9 Honnold~ it's still a good rope (my GF owned one)~ just a little heavy for what I typically like ( I mostly climb on 8.9 - 9.4),1
1586,It still handles really well though.,1
1587,They're reputedly very durable~ but they have a higher than average impact force,1
1588,Seem like a great sport project rope,1
1589,The Airliner is my favorite rope of all time.,1
1590,A climbing partner of mine bought a 10.2 Maxim rope a few years back,1
1591,What we both noticed about it is that it is really stiff,1
1592,It reminds me of typical gym top ropes in that it is not particularly easy to make knots in,1
1593,At one point during a climb I noticed my well dressed and tensioned double fisherman backup knot after the figure eight follow through on my harness completely unravel itself,1
1594,I also noticed well dressed and tensioned double fisherman stopper knots for rappels almost come undone,1
1595,We decided that for this rope it needed triple fisherman knots,1
1596,I'm not impressed with this rope,1
1597,Neither of us particularly cares for it,1
1598,I don't know if all of their ropes are like this,1
1599,My piece of advice is to not buy these without being able to feel and compare how supple they are compared to other brands,1
1600,I used the 9.9 Honnold Glider bi-pattern for a while,1
1601,It starts off stiff and smooth with good handling,1
1602,After I put it through its' paces the sheath softened up and it became extremely slow to feed and in general very poor to handle,1
1603,It's also heavy at 66g/m~ and at that weight I wish it were more durable,1
1604,I used the 9.9 Honnold Glider bi-pattern for a while,1
1605,It starts off stiff and smooth with good handling,1
1606,After I put it through its' paces the sheath softened up and it became extremely slow to feed and in general very poor to handle,1
1607,It's also heavy at 66g/m~ and at that weight I wish it were more durable,1
1608,All of the Glider 9.9's come with a twill-weave sheath and are stiffer than most ropes,1
1609,I like that because I use them for lead rope soloing and the combination of slightly stiffer than normal and a smooth sheath are an ideal pairing with the Edelrid Eddy I use,1
1610,As I said above~ been through about ten of them and~ while a little softer at the end of a season~ it's not markedly so from my experience.,1
1611,Used to get Mammut ropes almost exclusively~ now Maxim pretty much exclusively! Have not had that particular cord~ but was impressed with some other models,1
1612,I mean Honnold obviously doesn't trust it.,1
1613,I mean Honnold obviously doesn't trust it,1
1614,Does he trust any ropes?,1
1615,I had a 10.2mm one and LOVED the way it handled,1
1616,It turned 10 last year and I retired it~ though,1
1617,Great rope with a soft catch.,1
1618,had a 9.1 airliner as a redpointing rope,1
1619,ended up working it really hard and it's held up better than any rope I've had~ despite being skinny and dragged through all manner of dirt and grit,1
1620,Lasted significantly longer than any other rope i've had and kept a smooth sheath,1
1621,Sheath on my maxim glider gym rope melted through somehow in less than 6 months of use twice a week,1
1622,Will never buy their ropes again,1
1623,I've been very happy with my Beal Yuji and Blue Water Lightning Pro Double Dry,1
1624,Just bought yet another 9.9 Glider yesterday...,1
1625,I've only owned one of their ropes,1
1626,I bought: https://www.rei.com/product/869679/maxim-alex-honnold-signature-bi-pattern-glider-99mm-x-70m-dry-rope I took it climbing outside twice,1
1627,It got a random sheath tear that exposed the core on the 2nd trip,1
1628,I cannot figure out exactly how it tore as anchors were well extended,1
1629,I wouldn't buy maxim ropes again,1
1630,I think they have a problem with their braid,1
1631,Dunno~ as I said~ just bought my eleventh one and have never had a single complaint with any of them - and I don't coddle them in any way.,1
1632,I have owned two of the 9.9 gliders and now have a 9.5 Maxim,1
1633,I love everything about these ropes except the sheath durability and for that reason will not buy another one~ at least for a few years of exploring other brands again,1
1634,The super tight weave of the sheath gives these ropes their incredible handling of easier clips due to increased stiffness~ and fast handling due to the increased slickness/decreased friction,1
1635,Unfortunately the tight sheath~ in my opinion~ also results in much more frequent and greater sheath damage than ropes with 'normal' sheaths,1
1636,Think of the difficulty in cutting a rope that is limp versus cutting it while holding it in tension,1
1637,I have used other Maxim ropes that I liked~ but I had a Maxim Glider 9.9 and I absolutely hated it,1
1638,It was SO stiff and hard to belay with~ especially from above in guide mode,1
1639,Pulling slack through grigri kind of sucked too,1
1640,I sold it after using it a few times,1
1641,It might have broken in if I used it more~ but honestly~ I've used lots of other ropes and that was the worst,1
1642,Yeah the 9.9 Gliders are stiff due to the twill sheath weave which is quite a bit finer~ tighter and smoother than most rope sheath weaves,1
1643,In many respects it handles a lot like a Mammut SuperSafe 10.2,1
1644,But those qualities are what I need for pairing with my Edelrid Eddy for roped soloing - might look at other ropes for climbing with partners,1
1645,None of the ten that i've owned ever got much in the way of sheath damage to speak of except one that was a couple of years old and somewhat abused,1
1646,I've had a 60m glider (I think it's 10.2?) for 3 years and have found it to be very durable,1
1647,I paid $120ish when i bought it (60m~ dry~ no bi-pattern)~ and that seemed like a very good deal at the time when I compared it to others with similar specs,1
1648,I'd say it feels heavy for the diameter~ the pattern I have is not particularly cool (but whatever)~ and it's true that it doesn't hold knots as well as others when it's new,1
1649,But it broke in nicely~ seems durable as hell~ and was a good price,1
1650,My skinnier ropes aren't Maxims~ but I'll definitely consider one of their skinnier ropes when it's time to get another,1
1651,BTW~ FWIW~ Maxim is the climbing brand of Teufelberger,1
1652,They have a reputation for excellent cordage across many industries~ and are definitely not an unknown or bootstrapped operation.,1
1653,I have used other Maxim ropes that I liked~ but I had a Maxim Glider 9.9 and I absolutely hated it,1
1654,It was SO stiff and hard to belay with~ especially from above in guide mode,1
1655,Pulling slack through grigri kind of sucked too,1
1656,I sold it after using it a few times,1
1657,It might have broken in if I used it more~ but honestly~ I've used lots of other ropes and that was the worst,1
1658,I feel the same way~ Maxim makes (in my opinion~ based on my desired rope characteristics) the WORST ropes,1
1659,Names like Glider and Airliner should really be Steel Cable and Rebar,1
1660,If I'm cragging with multiple people and someone needs a catch on a Maxim~ I'll volunteer my own rope (usually a Sterling) instead of deal with what feels like 18.5 mm of high tension line stuffed into my belay device,1
1661,I can totally see why Honnold gets the ropes for free(?) and still doesn't use them :-P,1
1662,Yeah the 9.9 Gliders are stiff due to the twill sheath weave which is quite a bit finer~ tighter and smoother than most rope sheath weaves,1
1663,In many respects it handles a lot like a Mammut SuperSafe 10.2,1
1664,But those qualities are what I need for pairing with my Edelrid Eddy for roped soloing - might look at other ropes for climbing with partners,1
1665,None of the ten that i've owned ever got much in the way of sheath damage to speak of except one that was a couple of years old and somewhat abused,1
1666,Take a look at Tendon Hattrick series of ropes~ soon to be available through campsaver.com,1
1667,Nice smooth weave on the sheath~ but still has a really nice hand,1
1668,Falls nicely between the stiff Maxim ropes and floppy Petzl ropes,1
1669,Really good for rope solo and standard climbing/belay situations,1
1670,Take a look at Tendon Hattrick series of ropes~ soon to be available through campsaver.com,1
1671,Nice smooth weave on the sheath~ but still has a really nice hand,1
1672,Falls nicely between the stiff Maxim ropes and floppy Petzl ropes,1
1673,Really good for rope solo and standard climbing/belay situations,1
1674,I was using Tendon 9.8's before switching to the 9.9 Gliders~ will take a look next rope - thanks,1
1675,[EDIT: Just looked,1
1676,Unfortunately they dropped from the 9.8 to a 9.7 and I really feel more comfortable lead rope soloing with a 9.8 or 9.9 in the Edelrid Eddy,1
1677,Tuning the device / rope pairing is pretty critical and am not too inclined to move away from a combo I know works well...thanks anyway though,1
1678,],1

1680,[EDIT: Just looked,1
1681,Unfortunately they dropped from the 9.8 to a 9.7 and I really feel more comfortable lead rope soloing with a 9.8 or 9.9 in the Edelrid Eddy,1
1682,Tuning the device / rope pairing is pretty critical and am not too inclined to move away from a combo I know works well...thanks anyway though,1
1683,] They have a Hattrick 9.9~ as well as 9.7~ 10.2~ 10.5,1
1684,They have a Hattrick 9.9~ as well as 9.7~ 10.2~ 10.5,1
1685,Maybe they've stopped making the 9.9 - at least it's not up on their website,1
1686,[EDIT:  I did finally find it in their 2017 pdf catalog,1
1687,],1
1688,No problem~ I went through about a half dozen or so of the Tendon 9.8s before I decided that extra mm of the 9.9 was worth having in the rope solo rig,1
1689,Will take a look next time I'm getting one.,1
1690,Getting mixed reviews of the 9.9mm glider; I'm glad I purchased it at REI in the event that it doesn't work out so well,1
1691,Can't believe that no one's yet suggested getting Totems instead of the rope,1
1692,Must be a slow day.,1
1693,Just cut the new 70m Honnold Glider I got a deal on down to a 60m because that's what fits in the bag I rope solo with and I don't want to carry the weight of a full 70m at the start of pitches,1
1694,Don't think ill of me...,1
1695,I just cut my Maxim 70m x 9.5mm in half due to a weird fray and severe kinking and swollen section after about 5 uses,1
1696,This occurred in a rappel,1
1697,I inspected the core after chopping~ and could not find any damage,1
1698,I'm guessing one or two of the fiber bundles got severely twisted and pinched,1
1699,Like others have said~  very durable~ a bit stiff,1
1700,They tend to have higher impact force than other similar size ropes,1
1701,9.9 KN.,1
1702,I got a Pinnacle 9.5mm (really 9.7mm) for cheap in Squamish this year,1
1703,Whilst It's been durable enough to use as my primary line and even left for weeks at a time as a fixed line on the chief~ you can't overlook how poorly it handles,1
1704,The strange weave and stiffness make this rope a chore to clip and feed through grigri etc,1
1705,All in all a good rope as a durable and cheap workhorse but unsuited to more technical climbing.,1
1706,I have an older 9.8 glide 70m that I love,1
1707,My partner says it’s too stiff compared to his mammut,1
1708,Every time I buy a non-Mammut rope I'm disappointed,1
1709,These days I just go with Mammut,1
1710,I've never had one I didn't like,1
1711,I have the 9.9 Biweave and I love it,1
1712,Great general purpose rope for all types of climbing,1
1713,I’m on my 2nd season with this rope and don’t have any complaints,1
1714,Mostly outdoor sport climbing~ but used on a few trad routes as well,1
1715,I picked up a maxim 9.9 bi-color dry treated,1
1716,Paid a little over $200 because I like having the afore-mentioned features,1
1717,It’s much more stiff than all the Sterling ropes I’ve had~ but also a little bit thicker,1
1718,Ropes are ropes..,1
1719,go for the features you like at your chosen price point,1
1720,I personally don’t overthink it beyond that,1
1721,Bought another airliner and i dont think i will buy anything else ever again,1
1722,I also just went out and bought the airliner..,1
1723,Excited to try this out very soon!,1
1724,All of the last five maxim ropes I have owned have shown really poor durability compared to any and all other brands of rope,1
1725,They handle like a dream~ but are easily core-shot,1
1726,All ropes are not equal~ although most have very similar handling and durability,1
1727,Maxim ropes unfortunately just don't last,1
1728,I only have the Platinum,1
1729,I haven't been thrilled with its handling--even for the diameter it feels stiff--but the features make up for it,1
1730,I'd say durability is good-not-great for the diameter~ but I tend to be pretty tough on ropes and mostly climb on either rough granite or sandstone,1
1731,Thats really werid,1
1732,As my experience and many of my friends only buy these for their durability,1
1733,Hi everyone~ I'm in need of some help,1
1734,I'm studying how climbing brand's use educational content on social media for my master's in sports management,1
1735,I'd really appreciate it if you'd fill out my survey! Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0UCxjM_kZLfaUSr5Iv4dkwA4GYsUtLZOO-o_wV9XD_KFjbw/viewform,1
1736,Your questions are leading~ as if you know what you want to get in return - it's a great way to get the answers you want,1
1737,Right?,1
1738,You're off to a start,1
1739,Market research surveys take quite a bit of understanding,1
1740,keep it up and you'll get there,1
1741,Keep working on more objective questions,1
1742," A ""maybe"" answer would have been what I would check on most of these if it were available",1
1743,There are many factors that go into successful brands and products~ utility~ design~ style~ fashion~ and endorsement,1
1744,Omega Pacific was the cheap crap for decades,1
1745,Then a few years ago their design became brilliant and the brand became valuable over night,1
1746,Chouinard Equipiment was a powerful brand in the 70's and 80's,1
1747,Lawyers turned it into Black Diamond,1
1748,Same stuff but a different name and the brand became slightly less valuable,1
1749,As the founder moved away from the brand and it grew in the hands of others~ it started to have a big corporate look and lost respect from long term fans of Chouinard,1
1750,I could go on about many others,1
1751,The idea that training content is going to make the brand is only a part of the picture,1
1752,You could provide great content but if brand was made in an unpopular overseas country it would do little to move that brand,1
1753,Petzl was just another European brand decades ago,1
1754,But they really got their engineering going and came up with some clever and quality stuff,1
1755,They also have some nice content,1
1756,Your survey also implies that we are concerned about safety,1
1757,That may be true for that mass hordes of new climbers,1
1758,But not at all for real athletes who push the envelope and get printed up in the mags,1
1759,Climbing skill~ climbing efficiency~ these are far more valuable to many than safety,1
1760,Perhaps a survey that found out what qualities climbers seek,1
1761,"Another question you might consider is ""how much did you spend on climbing gear in the last year?"" with multiple choice answers",1
1762,Older climbers~ like me~ have lots of opinions but spend diddly squat on new gear so you could pretty much throw out our answers,1
1763,If you want to make money you have to find out who has it and research how to get it from them,1
1764,My 2 cents,1
1765,40 years marketing experience,1
1766,45 years climbing experience.,1
1767,Fourth question out of the gate is not really valid,1
1768,I’m not so confident there is any correlation between skill and the number of years spent climbing,1
1769,After my first 5 years of climbing I was still a total gumby and not ‘advanced’ by any stretch,1
1770,Also~ what is ‘skill’ in this context? The grade you can climb? Proficiency in rigging~ hauling and big wall techniques? Ability to recognize objective hazards in an alpine environment? I hate seeing the weekly survey picked apart~ but consider running this by your advisor and reworking some of the questions,1
1771,I’m in agreement with an earlier post that the questions are very leading,1
1772,An interesting concept,1
1773,Wishing you luck on your thesis.,1
1774,I understand how hard it is to create a high quality~ unbiased survey for data collections purposes,1
1775,It seems simple in theory but is actually quite difficult,1
1776,I took your survey~ but I agree with others that some weird assumptions were made~ i.e,1
1777,one is assumed to be an advanced climber if they've been climbing more than 5 years,1
1778,"Also~ a lot of climbers like myself ""abide by safety recommendations when climbing"" under variable conditions~ depending on the situation",1
1779,"It was also unclear if references to ""improving your skill/becoming a better climber"" meant improving one's movement technique~ or improving one's understanding of equipment handling techniques~ or both~ or something else~ or whatever the survey taker assumes it to be? People's assumptions of what this means as they approach the survey could muddy the results I think~ but not in a way you could dissect after the fact since there's nothing in the survey which allows people to let you know their interpretation",1
1780,Learning how to use a specific piece of equipment vs learning how to belay or how/when to sling out trad protection pieces are very different types of content,1
1781,I feel that climbers with 15 or 20+ years of experience vs climbers with~ say~ 2-6 years of experience will approach this survey very differently,1
1782,Which may be one of the things you're trying parse out with your data~ but I found there to be no nuance or additional selections or ability to comment to give you any information why I feel just because a brand teaches me something means I will or won't be brand loyal or more likely to trust their reliability,1
1783,Just some food for thought when it comes time to look at the results.,1
1784,The survey sucked~ unfortunately,1
1785,It reeks of bias,1
1786,On an anecdotal front~ I've always considered Petzl to be a great example of a brand that emphasizes the user-perspective educational strategy very effectively,1
1787,I can quickly read their cartoon-style instructions~ and could also watch how-to videos for their products,1
1788,That information is very easy to find on their websites~ etc,1
1789,That said I have never once bought a piece of Petzl gear simply on the virtue that the company emphasizes an educational strategy,1
1790,And I never made a decision not to buy a given piece of gear from a different company based on some perceived lack of educational material~ either,1
1791,I don't need a how-to guide attached to every claw hammer I might purchase,1
1792,Same is true for climbing gear,1
1793,Its actually kind of ridiculous to expect educational materials be made available at every point of purchase,1
1794,However I don't make or break buy decisions based on entertainment value either,1
1795,Patagonia makes some cool videos but never once did one of those cool videos prompt me to make a purchase,1
1796,In the case of Patagonia the only successful strategy is 40% off~ hah! I don't care who their ambassadors are or what they do~ I truly don't,1
1797,They can fire them all for all I care,1
1798,Oh wait~ they did that already,1
1799,I don't care~ they're just models anyway,1
1800,Good~ no~ great gear at a fair price~ that's what I'm after,1
1801,"If a brand were to ask me my advice it would be ""focus on making the best gear possible and then sell it at a fair price."" Edu material is a good attribute to add to a product line but at least for me that edu material is not actually material to a purchase decision.",1
1802,I'm trying to decide on a harness,1
1803,I'm thinking about the BD solution guide bc I want to start doing multipitch this summer,1
1804,I often do only single pitch outdoor climbing though..,1
1805,Right now I'm doing lots of indoor climbing,1
1806,So I need a good all-rounder..,1
1807,Any opinions?,1
1808,Gear loops are kinda small on the solution guide,1
1809,I like the Petzl Sama and the metolius safe tech,1
1810,Enough space on gear loops and comfortable (for me) at a hanging belay.,1
1811,Petzl Adjama,1
1812,One of the best all arounders I’ve ever used,1
1813,The harness that doesnt hurt you after a +30 minute hanging belay.,1
1814,Hey,1
1815,Thinking about the petzl Sana or black diamond guide,1
1816,My friends are saying go for the BD~ but I don't know,1
1817,Opinions on those two specifically,1
1818,FWIW~ I recently ordered a BD solution guide~ and can confirm Travis' comment- the gear loops are smaller than I'd like; but more importantly~ the non-adjustable leg loops were too small for my thunder thighs~ even while only wearing thin pants,1
1819,I ended up selling the harness to a scronny friend who is just getting into climbing~ and got myself a petzl Adjama- much more gear loop space~ super comfy~ and even has a 5th rear gear loop for anchor gear/extra stuff,1
1820,I agree with Layne~ great all around~ comfy~ lots of gear~ and not too expensive.,1
1821," Petzl Adjama for a ""low cost"" all around Harness~ and the Arcteryx AR series for ""High end"" all around",1
1822,The solutions gear loops are wayyyyy too small for multipitch.,1
1823,Also the key difference between the Sama and Adjama is that Adjama has adjustable leg loops; Sana’s are fixed and also not friendly for thunder thighs! Boo!,1
1824,Literally replying to up the Jeremy count,1
1825,Sad to see that Misty Mountain gets skipped,1
1826,I guess they don’t contribute enough ad dollars,1
1827,I think a MM will be my next harness if I can ever wear out this Adjama,1
1828,My last one was a Cadillac back around 1990,1
1829,I loved that thing,1
1830,These review sites make money when companies offer them kickbacks for a click-to-sale,1
1831,It’s called affiliate marketing,1
1832,Metolius and Misty Mountain may not offer as much (or any) money in comparison to Petzl or BD,1
1833,Always be skeptical of review sites with this business model,1
1834,I’ve never gotten the Misty mountain fan club,1
1835,I haven’t been impressed by any of their harness,1
1836,They are comfy if you are just standing there~ but the fleece lining gets so hot and sweaty so fast~ and the waist is basically just a 1” seatbelt harness covered in foam,1
1837,Every other manufacturer (yes I know that’s an exaggeration~ but most of the big names) has found ways to spread that load better than EVA foam,1
1838,Misty even had to stop selling a whole harness and a leg loop option because so many people were getting their family jewels crushed,1
1839,How does a company that only specializes in one thing get that one thing THAT wrong?,1
1840,There seems to be two camps here~ people who love MM harnesses~ and those that have never used a MM harness,1
1841,I'm on my third MM Cadillac~ and second Turbo,1
1842,The comfort is outstanding~ the gear loops are perfect~ they are extremely burly and they look cool,1
1843,I also own a BD Momentum and a Petzl Sama,1
1844,They are good gym/top rope harnesses~ and maybe sport climbing~ but they suck balls for trad climbing,1
1845,The loops are too small on the BD~ and the Petzl has a strange overlapping gear loop that makes it hard to pick gear out~ which is not good for hard trad,1
1846,So buy whatever you can afford~ and then go and buy a Misty Mountain when you age enough value comfort over trendiness (Arc'teryx),1
1847,I haven't owned one~ But I have climbed in both a Caddy and a Turbo,1
1848,Both were meh at best for me,1
1849,Agreed,1
1850,I own a misty,1
1851,It sits in my closet in favor of my camp energy which is both much more comfortable and lighter.,1
1852,I thought the whole point of the Solution Guide was to offer a model with larger gear loops than the Solution~ are you saying they didn’t even got that right? Also from BD’s website the Solution Guide does have a 5th gear loop at the back,1
1853,Misty Mountain Cady and Turbo are great multi-pitch harnesses that rack plenty of gear~ are comfortable~ and very durable,1
1854,Plus you can call them and discuss several customizable options,1
1855,Doubt any other manufactures will do that,1
1856,Made in the USA,1
1857,I haven't owned one~ But I have climbed in both a Caddy and a Turbo,1
1858,Both were meh at best for me,1
1859,I think they fit certain body shapes better than others...my buddy that is very thin with a long waist (5'10 and 140lb) does not like either the Turbo or the Cadillac,1
1860,Loves his Petzl Calidris~ even though they wear out every few years.,1
1861,I thought the whole point of the Solution Guide was to offer a model with larger gear loops than the Solution~ are you saying they didn’t even got that right? Also from BD’s website the Solution Guide does have a 5th gear loop at the back,1
1862,Yeah that was my understanding too~ but I was let down,1
1863,held them side by side with a BD Momentum harness and saw no difference,1
1864,"The 5th loop in the back is nice~ and there's a small ""0kN"" loop for a chalk bag~ but the main loops are plain ol'.",1
1865,My own two cents based on harnesses I have used: Petzl Adjama: -you will bruise with more than a light trad rack -I used it on RNWF of half dome~ massive bruises,1
1866,-small gear loops -good gym harness -good sport harness -cheap -not comfy for even semi-hanging belays Misty Mountain Cadillac -comfy af -the extra gear loops are good for walls and beginner trad when you feel the need to bring the kitchen sink -it is pretty heavy~ but not you still have a good range of motion and your rack will weight more -takes a beating (I've put over 1000 granite and sandstone pitches on mine in the last 2.5 years) -it's nice as a beginner when you aren't as dialed on light and fast systems Edelrid Ace Ambassador -super comfortable -roomy gear loops -cool color -light as all get out -holds the nose record -I use this for lightning fast climbs and projecting/hard onsighting -starts to droop a little past a double rack to 4 BD Momentum -jk~ just don't,1
1867,Yeah that was my understanding too~ but I was let down,1
1868,held them side by side with a BD Momentum harness and saw no difference,1
1869,"The 5th loop in the back is nice~ and there's a small ""0kN"" loop for a chalk bag~ but the main loops are plain ol'",1
1870,thanks for the feedback,1
1871,Disapointing cause I love my Solution~  but it's just not roomy enough for trad/multipitch and was hoping the guide would offer a good alternative,1
1872,Looks like they focus more on the material durability than loading capacity,1
1873,Damn~ need to look elsewhere for a multipitch harness then.,1
1874,I think you should hang in a harness before you buy it,1
1875,Hang in several of these recommended harnesses and then make your choice,1
1876,Most climbing shops will be happy to let you try them out.,1
1877,The best harness I have ever had was a Yates,1
1878,I've had a couple of BD they were ok,1
1879,I use a metolius now & have for several years~ I think I'm on my third one now,1
1880,I like it only because it fits me well and it has never hurt me in a fall,1
1881,I like Scott's idea~ go hang in them.,1
1882,Singing Rock Dome harness,1
1883,Comfort ***** Super big gear loops ***** Inexpensive ***** Saw a rigger/camera person from 'Free Solo' wearing one,1
1884,My favorite trad harness in 45 years.,1
1885,My girlfriend just got the Solution guide today...looks badass,1
1886,Material seems bomber~ the gear loops are pretty slick and she said it was quite comfortable,1
1887,Obviously haven’t put it through a “hanging belay” test yet~ but I’ve never been in a harness that made a hanging belay very comfortable anyway,1
1888,I’ve been wearing the previous version~ the chaos~ for years and love it,1
1889,I would only suspect BD made the current iteration even better,1
1890,Im curious about the bd technician,1
1891,It has 5 gear loops~ 4 ice clippers~ adjustable leg loops~ and possibly bigger gear loops than the guide,1
1892,Thinking it may have to be my do everything,1
1893,Also a fan of the Adjama,1
1894,I also have a solution for sport climbing~ but I don't think I've touched it since I picked up the adjama,1
1895,Maybe a couple times for gym sessions but that's about it,1
1896,Now that I think of it~ I am not even sure where it is....somewhere in the garage I guess,1
1897,The adjama is cheap~ flexible~ has a ton of room for gear~ and comfy IMO,1
1898,I also like the slanted gear loop~ although my partner has said they didn't like it,1
1899,Keep my gear in front and ready to grab,1
1900,Edit: the one thing that I don't like about the adjama is the leg loops....they don't go small enough to fit my chicken legs~ and i tend to like non-adjustable leg loops,1
1901,The adjama was a disappointment in the area of leg loops imo,1
1902,When in a hanging belay~ or when belaying someone who may hang dog~ the loops creep into my  crotch more than I'd like,1
1903,Although I do have fairly slender upper legs,1
1904,It's never mentioned in these discussions but my go to for trad racks is my DMM Viper 2,1
1905,5 loops with good room and it has a floating belt for making things even,1
1906,I really like the floating belt,1
1907,It solves another issue the adjama has,1
1908,It's lighter weight than harnesses like the Cadillac but is big enough to comfortable and handle heavy racking,1
1909,The only thing I wish was different is that the 5th gear loop connects low on the belt line whereas others~ like the adjama~ have the 5th loop connected towards the top,1
1910,Minor I reckon,1
1911,The Sama is the same harness without the leg buckles,1
1912,I have one~ like the fit~ don't like it for trad at all,1
1913,The rear gear loops are moronic,1
1914,Arcteryx harnesses are worth every penny.,1
1915,I second this,1
1916,Huge gear loops super comfy and some good covid-19 deals happening right now,1
1917,I currently use an Arc’teryx harness and I was pretty concerned because there was no padding but I’ve owned it for 4 months now and il have to say I’m in love yea it does cost a lot but usually harnesses last a long time unless you’re high-lineing,1
1918,Yea it’s expensive but the comfort and adjustability on the Arc’teryx harness is unreal literally everything is adjustable including the space between the belay leg loop like it’s in real how comfortable this is,1
1919,It’s 25% off at Arc’teryx try it use it don’t like it return it but I highly doubt you will,1
1920,Hands down best all around harness period And it’s a harness that will grow with you,1
1921,For example if you want to get into ice climbing it will do it it’s got all of it built in,1
1922,I’m a one and done kinda guy buy once don’t buy till it’s shot,1
1923,It’s worth it send it bro.,1
1924,I bought a solution guide recently and am really enjoying it fwiw,1
1925,I use the dead bird harness~ AR version,1
1926,Great harness and quite durable~ just get it on sale as some point,1
1927,Someone pointed it out as being trendy~ however I hardly see anyone climbing in them,1
1928,The company started out making harneses and they are great.,1
1929,thanks for the feedback,1
1930,Disapointing cause I love my Solution~  but it's just not roomy enough for trad/multipitch and was hoping the guide would offer a good alternative,1
1931,Looks like they focus more on the material durability than loading capacity,1
1932,Damn~ need to look elsewhere for a multipitch harness then,1
1933,I too liked my Solution and just ordered the Guide,1
1934,It sure looks like the Guide has bigger front loops than the regular Solution...,1
1935,I too liked my Solution and just ordered the Guide,1
1936,It sure looks like the Guide has bigger front loops than the regular Solution..,1
1937,I would agree from the pictures too~ but the feedback receive was that is wasn't the case,1
1938,Any chance I could convince you to post side-by-side pictures with dimensions/reference when you get the Guide?,1
1939,Will do,1
1940,I would agree from the pictures too~ but the feedback receive was that is wasn't the case,1
1941,Any chance I could convince you to post side-by-side pictures with dimensions/reference when you get the Guide?  Also curious,1
1942,I thought they were the same size..,1
1943,unfortunately.,1
1944,I would agree from the pictures too~ but the feedback receive was that is wasn't the case,1
1945,Expensive~ but Arc'Teryx AR395 is a really nice harness with large gear loops and adjustable leg loops,1
1946,Also allows great freedom of movement/feels like not wearing a harness IMO,1
1947,Arc'Teryx harnesses sometimes are sometimes described as uncomfortable for hanging belays~ but I and everyone I've spoken to who owns an Arc harness finds them comfy for hanging belays,1
1948,I use men's size medium AR-395 for ice season (need the adjustable leg loops for my layers and thunder thighs) and a women's large FL-365 (same at AR-395 but w/fixed leg loops),1
1949,Found the BD solution legs to be too confining at my waist size,1
1950,Arc makes the C-Quence harnesses now that I think replace FL-365,1
1951,Supposedly comfier.,1
1952," Just got my Guide and the front loops are 3.5"" inside vs 3"" of space on the rear loops",1
1953,Racks 10 full sized on the front comfortably~ 8 on the back,1
1954,Comfy to hang in for the few minutes I tried it out.,1
1955,I don’t understand what you guys are clipping to your waist when you trad climb,1
1956,Gear man! You?,1
1957,Gear man! You? Usually not much gear,1
1958,If I know exactly what I need~ that will go on my front gear loops~ and maybe a biner of nuts~ but otherwise I put most gear on the shoulder sling,1
1959,Usually I put draws on my front gear loops,1
1960,Nut tool on the left front,1
1961,Water~ shoes~ whatever left rear,1
1962,Spare biners~ belay~ anchor on right rear,1
1963,Shoes or water in the back,1
1964,I need to tell you guys though,1
1965,Today I was on a climb I’ve done several times,1
1966,I had maybe 25’ to the anchor and one #3 to get me there,1
1967,Just so happens that said #3 hanging from gear sling has intertwined itself with a locker on my harness in such a way it was impossible to undo with one hand (two lobes were through the locker),1
1968,So after a minute of switching hands and fiddling (and swearing and such) I down climbed 10 feet or so and had to take on my last piece so I could use two hands to unsnarl my gear,1
1969,Gear slings are awful for anything that isn't mixed climbing.,1
1970,Looking for recommendations on good places to get a resole,1
1971,In the past I went to someone who seemed to use rubber quite different (more aggressive) than what was on my original shoe and I didn’t love it,1
1972,If you could mention what makes your place good it would mean a ton!! Price and time are certainly factors but the QUALITY of the resole matters by far the most to me!,1
1973,Do you mean that the resole changed the shape of the forefoot/toe of your shoe?  The rubber itself~ contrary to what some will say~ won't change the shoe into a more aggressive last,1
1974,The rubber is either softer/grippier~ or slightly harder and will edge a bit better,1
1975,I've had good luck with Yosemite Bum~ but they only offer Evolv rubber- which works fine for me.,1
1976,Onsight Resoles!  Ian does great work!  He's already resoled three pairs for me~ and I have no intention of looking elsewhere!https://www.onsightresoles.com/,1
1977,I wonder if Alf still does mobile resoles,1
1978,Rock and resole in Boulder~ CO have been my go-to resoler's,1
1979,I sent them 2 pairs of shoes(Some TC pros and Mythos) and got both back a week and a half later with shipping,1
1980,Those cobblers know what they're doing,1
1981,And the do it well and quickly!  ​Rock and Resole​​​,1
1982,I've used Peach Cobbler Resole for the last 4 or 5 resoles/rands,1
1983,They do an awesome job with a fast turn around time~ I send two pair to them in Jan and turn around time was 4-5 days.peachcobbleratl.com/ Obviously I've used my shoes a bunch since then~ but you can still tell that they did a wicked good job on the resole/rands,1
1984,Wish I had pics from when I had just gotten them back~ edges were sharp,1
1985,If you live in Denver must go to rock and resole,1
1986,They always do a fantastic job~ always.,1
1987,They took 2 months on the last pair I sent them~ but they have done a fantastic job every time.,1
1988,I have had really awesome luck with The Rubber Room Resoles,1
1989,Tony does a really good job at re-skinning your shoes~ and he won't re-sole a basket case to make a buck,1
1990,Positive Resoles also has done good work for me in the past...,1
1991,Greater Tahoe Gripworks! Only does La Sportiva now but idk why you would be climbing in anything else.http://www.tahoegripworks.com/ Cheers,1
1992,Greater Tahoe Gripworks,1
1993,Has anyone tried out Unparallel for resoling?,1
1994,Yosemite Bum tends to have solid prices and shorter turnaround than Rock and Resole~ but I've had some touch-and-go customer service there,1
1995,I talked to one person on the phone who assured me they could turn around my shoes in 5 business days in advance of a trip to the valley; when I got there to drop them off the guy at the counter assured me that timeframe was completely impossible,1
1996,However~ I've been impressed with the job they do on the resoles themselves,1
1997,That being said~ the phone number to Rock and Resole is (303) 440-0414,1
1998,Has anyone had access yet to the new ATC Pilot? Any first impressions? Any word on release dates?,1
1999,There was discussion on MP.com earlier this year -  MP.com thread   My memory is little hazy~ but IIRC someone mentioned that ATC Pilot is remarkably similar to a belay device from one of the European manufactures,1
2000,You decide - ATC Pilot,1
2001,Thanks for the comparison,1
2002,Especially considering I just heard back from BD Pilot not released until Summer 2018.,1
2003,Thanks Jim - almost all the reviews are other than English~ so helpful to know what they have to say.,1
2004,I was able to translate several reviews on the Salewa Ergo - enough positives to give it a go until 2018 when hopefully the Pilot comes out.,1
2005,Happy New Year~ everybody!!   In my opinion~ the Salewa Ergo is quite good,1
2006,However~ I would much rather recommend this German creation: Edelrid Megajul   I've been belaying with it for more than two years now and~ although I am still an absolute BD-ATC-fan~ this tiny~ mega light German invention offers exactly the same belay functions as the BD-ATC but it weighs much much less,1
2007,"AND on top of that it works as a ""semi"" automatic blocking device (""semi"" as the are very carful not to call it ""full"" automatic as for example the Petzl Grigri~ for some legal reasons)",1
2008,I don't know whether it is obtainable in the US thogh,1
2009,Saludos~ Yelmo,1
2010,I just has a chance to use both the Mega Jul and Sawela Ergo,1
2011,Between the two~ I found the Ergo smoother for lowering and the MJ more grabby,1
2012,Also the Ergo more positive passive breaking,1
2013,The only downside I found with the Ergo was tendency for the break side rope to drift off the right side of the guide when lowering~ which is a narrow metal edge,1
2014,The pictures of the Pilot appear to have solved for this wear by rolling the edge of the metal.,1
2015,I hate rappelling with MJ~ can't get it run smoothly,1
2016,Makes me   Bounce to much,1
2017,Nice if you have to work the rope tho~ pretty much autolocks,1
2018,But just haven't figured out a smooth rappel down the rope with it.,1
2019,Flip MJ around and rappel.,1
2020,i would also recommend the mammut smart as a similar device,1
2021,Flip MJ around and rappel,1
2022,Fine for single pitch~ but if you go past a rap station and have to work back up that MJ is gonna lock the wrong direction.,1
2023,I think I mentioned the Pilot in another thread~ but after belaying a half dozen pitches I think it's a pretty solid device,1
2024,No rappelling so I can't speak to that,1
2025,It is definitely better than the Mammut Smart,1
2026,I can't speak to the Megajul because I haven't used one,1
2027,The lowering is REALLY smooth,1
2028,That's actually the feature I like most about it,1
2029,I think with more use I may start to prefer it to the grigri~ but right now I'm more used to the grigri so it's probably still my preferred device,1
2030,Tested it with a 9.7mm rope and the BD Vaporlock carabiner,1
2031,My partner also used it and said he liked it a lot and preferred it to the megajul,1
2032,It locks up well~ but does let a little rope slowly go through if you're not applying pressure to the brake strand,1
2033,Easy for boinging the leader back up the rope after a fall,1
2034," Haven't seen the ATC pilot but had an opportunity to use a "" Click-up"" in Kalymnos & thought it was DOPE despite writing it off as a gimmick at first",1
2035,Super smooth~ easy to lower/pay out slack~ etc,1
2036,Might be a viable option if you're not getting off the ground/rappelling and want an assisted-brake belay device,1
2037,"Plus~ that audible ""Click"" when you fall makes you feel all warm and fuzzy about the brake working properly",1
2038,http://www.climbingtechnology.com/en/outdoor-en/belay-devices-and-descenders/assisted-braking/click-up,1
2039,I've been using the ARC Pilot for about a month now~ and I'm really impressed with it,1
2040,It works great for toprope and lead belay,1
2041,Lowering is smooth,1
2042,It locks well to hold falls,1
2043,A slight lift on the thumb catch and you can pay out slack easily,1
2044,Durable and easy to use,1
2045,Comparable to the Jul 2,1
2046,Well suited for single pitch and gym use.,1
2047,I've been using the ARC Pilot for about a month now~ and I'm really impressed with it,1
2048,It works great for toprope and lead belay,1
2049,Lowering is smooth,1
2050,It locks well to hold falls,1
2051,A slight lift on the thumb catch and you can pay out slack easily,1
2052,Durable and easy to use,1
2053,Comparable to the Jul 2,1
2054,Well suited for single pitch and gym use,1
2055,I 100% agree,1
2056,I get asked about mine all the time in the gym,1
2057,I've used it a lot for both top rope and lead,1
2058,Tried the ATC pilot,1
2059,It's on display in BD store and for sale too,1
2060,It's smooth for lowering~ easy to use~ but just why....,1
2061,40.00 for a device for gym and cragging without the ability to rap in most situations..,1
2062,If they make a double slot model I'd be interested~ until then~ it's just like the jul~ or mammut device~ extremely limited,1
2063,It's a bit bulky too for those with small hands.,1
2064,Works great in the gym~ lowering a heavy climber is super smooth~ I can adjust the speed and it catches falls instantly,1
2065,For me~ autolock works on this device just as well as on Wild Country Revo~ which was 3x the price,1
2066,Hang dogging is a pleasure~ since the device holds the climber in place,1
2067,A lot less load on my hands.,1
2068,I just got one a week ago and have taken it to the gym to test twice now,1
2069,Obviously this is a purpose built~ assisted braking device~ designed for belayers on sport routes outside or in the gym,1
2070,I suppose you could take it out multi-pitch but I think I'd rather save weight in those situations~ although this device is by no means bulky or heavy,1
2071,If you know how to use a regular ATC style device it is totally redundant~ but I intend to keep it on my harness for when climbing with newer climbers for my own peace of mind~ besides the benefits that I personally see from using it myself for belaying my friends,1
2072,Anyway~ for its purpose its excellent,1
2073,It auto-locks effortlessly (I dont work for BD so I can say auto-locks without worrying about liability.) I weigh ~170lbs and the device took a lead fall in the gym with 10mm-ish rope~ no hands on the device and it locked,1
2074,I do not recommend you try this~ we did this indoors in a semi controlled environment~ Im sure there are scenarios where the geometry-based brake assist could be overcome~ such as if the finger/thumb loop were snagged on something~ causing the device to be pulled away from the belayer and disengaging the device,1
2075,Also~ I am clearly not a scientist,1
2076,The lock happens quickly~ and the disengagement is super smooth once you get the hang of it,1
2077,You simply roll the device back towards your waist to start lowering and away from you to slow it down or stop,1
2078,It's also intuitive as the rope runs just like a normal ATC,1
2079,A biggie for me is it's only $45 for a huge amount of additional safety on sport routes~ especially outside where anything could happen,1
2080,I also mentioned it is not bulky as some other posters mentioned,1
2081,I was actually quite surprised how small the device is,1
2082,"I have characteristically ""medium"" mens hands~ and you can see in these pictures it looks like Andre the Giants hands holding the device",1
2083,Pros- Auto-Locks No Moving Parts Light (much lighter than my old BD ATC ((did not have cut-outs)) Smooth lowering (also protects your hands from rope-burn) Cheap Seems to lower with more ease than my friends Mega Jul~ and my friend who already owns a GriGri2 plans to swap out to the ATC Pilot after one use,1
2084,Stows nicely with BD locking beaners and doesn't hang off the harness as far as a locker + atc (I just get personal enjoyment out of well engineered pieces of metal) Cons - Can't rap with it No top-down mode Redundant accessory purchase if you already own an ATC~ but good for peace of mind if you occasionally climb with less experienced belayers or just want an easier belay,1
2085,Bottom line~ its great for avid sport climbers looking for a little added safety who climb with a group and only rap ~50% of the time,1
2086,Anyone care to compare this to the old Wild Country SRC?  They seem to be a similar shape and function,1
2087,That has been my favorite device for being a belay slave or training new belayers,1
2088,I picked up one of the Mammut auto locking things with the big handle and have not liked it at all,1
2089,Reviving this thread to ask: Is there a certain type of biner to use with the pilot? I know with geometry based assisted lockers~ the biner matters,1
2090,Should I aim for the fattest~ roundest stock HMS biner I can find? Or any biner without weird kinks in it?,1
2091,Round stock works best.,1
2092,I believe most large HMS carabiners should work~ as long as the pilot does not clash with the carabiner~ when rotating,1
2093,I haven’t noticed any really significant difference in the assisted breaking~ when using round vs I-beam shaped carabiners,1
2094,For the assisted breaking function to work properly~ the belay device has to be able to freely rotate~ without obstruction,1
2095,Some mini-HMS carabiners or large HMS anti-crossloading carabiners could interfere with the rotation,1
2096,I found that the edelrid “bulletproof” biners  with the steel insert do not work well with the pilot; they are too smooth and the rope does not catch,1
2097,I have used the pilot quite a bit and that’s the only issue I have had so far,1
2098,I use it for anything other than multi pitch,1
2099,I use it for multi pitch~ it replaces my Grigr,1
2100,It’s lighter than a regular ATC so I just carry both,1
2101,I don’t always carry it but if I’m going to do a long climb I’ll take it instead of the Grigri,1
2102,You can rappel on a single strand with the ATC Pilot,1
2103,The set-up is exactly the same as rappelling with a Gri-Gri,1
2104,You can also use a carabiner brake rappel set-up~ if you want to rappel on 2 strands and do not want to bring an extra belay device,1
2105,My preferred set-up for multi-pitch is to have the leader carry a GiGi or Ovo for belaying the follower directly off the anchor and have the second belaying the leader on an ATC Pilot or GriGri,1
2106,When you transition to rappelling~ stack the rappel devices on the rope with the 2-strand device above the 1-strand device,1
2107,The 2-strand rappel device prevents the rope from being pulled through the anchor~ without requiring a carabiner or knot block.,1
2108,I gotta admit,1
2109,This method of stacking devices instead of the old eight on a bight and carabiner is fairly slick,1
2110,Kills two birds with one stone and keeps at least one climber alive,1
2111,Very smart method! Do you have a Youtube video of that?,1
2112,Very smart method! Do you have a Youtube video of that? No,1
2113,For someone who is already experienced with rappelling~ it is really quite simple and easy to practice,1
2114,Just practice it on horizontal ground~ first,1
2115,There can be a little bit of slippage through the 2-strand device~ which is easily stopped with either a friction hitch backup or a brake hand on both strands,1
2116,So~ the person stacked on top should be attentive and watch for rope slippage,1
2117,I think BD suggests you use their Gridlock pear-shaped locker with the device.,1
2118,I've spoken extensively in a previous thread~ I feel that the pilot is the absolute best belay device for the gym~ it's quick to learn to use and incredibly convenient- but that it doesn't have as much place outdoors,1
2119,I used to carry a Gri Gri and ATC on multi pitch climbs but more and more I’m brining the Pilot and my ATC and leaving the Gri Gri behind,1
2120,The Pilot weighs less than the ATC~ I get the auto locking of the Gri Gri at a fraction of the weight,1
2121,First~ these shoes have C4 rubber (EpicTV has them listed as HF)~ more stiff than the Aleon~ about as stiff as the new Hiangle.This shoe is what I thought the Aleon would be~ forefoot is quite flat and stiff~ very~ very comfortable,1
2122,Foot rests flat in the shoe~ think Skwama with less toe curl~ or perhaps Butora Acro Wide,1
2123,With how flat the forefoot is~ along with the relatively low volume of the front of the shoe~ I don’t think the shoe should be sized too aggressively~ but I’ll have a better impression once the shoe is properly broken in,1
2124,The heel is relaxed~ not as much as the Aleon~ but does make me wonder about aggressive heel hooks,1
2125,I tend to wear my street shoe in 5.10 shoes and that’s what I ordered,1
2126,Overall the fit feels right~ though I do have a bit of air when I go from standing on my toes to heels on the ground,1
2127,I’m tempted to try a half size smaller~ but I really don’t think the performance (besides possibly heel hooks) would be much better~ given how stiff and flat the forefoot is,1
2128,At that point~ might as well just pull out Hiangles,1
2129,The fabric on the inner sides of the shoes that the Velcro attaches to sits loose and looks a bit out of place~ but I don’t think will negatively effect performance,1
2130,Overall~ really great first impression~ looking forward to climbing in them,1
2131,With all the gym closures~ hopefully I’ll get outside within the next weekend or two.,1
2132,How's the new hiangles?,1
2133,They look pretty sweet~ I haven't heard about them until today,1
2134,thanks for the review,1
2135,Not the best moment to buy climbing shoes~ I'm afraid :-(,1
2136,I was never able to wear the old Hiangles due to the heel being too narrow; the new ones have a different heel (at least as far as I can tell) and they feel much better~ in my opinion,1
2137,There was an article or something that had a sketch of the prototype awhile back so I’ve been keeping an eye out for them,1
2138,It’s always the best moment to buy climbing shoes,1
2139,buddy tested a prototype~ said they were absolutely atrocious,1
2140,That settles it then~ end of thread,1
2141,For the past few years~ I have sworn by the La Sportiva Solution~ and pretty much refused to climb in anything else,1
2142,Given the high-end performance~ fit~ and last that I have always loved about the Solution~ I never saw any need to try a different shoe www.mcdvoice.com,1
2143,Hey Jacob~ nice review of the shoe,1
2144,Can I ask you how do you size other brands of climbing shoes (e.g,1
2145,la sportiva)? I am intrested in the crawe and I want to size it properly because I use to resole my shoes couple of times~ thus I would like it to last and not stretch a lot,1
2146,Thanks in advance!,1
2147,Hi there~ I am planning to climb Ben Nevis with my friends (once the weather gets better) and I am currently checking my equipment,1
2148,I noticed that my first aid kit certainly needs a refill,1
2149,I already stocked up most of it (bandages etc.) but I am still missing disposable gloves,1
2150,I did a quick research and found these,1
2151,I experienced some skin irritation in the past so maybe they will be fine since they are latex-free,1
2152,I hope that I won’t need to use them on our trip~ but you never know,1
2153,Does anyone have recommendations or tried these gloves out? Cheers~ Chris,1
2154,It's best to get tight fitting sterile gloves that are built with good integrity,1
2155,Im not sure those gloves meet either of those points,1
2156,You've been spammed!,1
2157,I have not used that brand~ but I have used similar ones for hand protection in my environmental career,1
2158,They are fine to protect the wearer~ but they do nothing to protect the person that you might be working on because they are not sterile,1
2159,Now~ if you do need them~ chances are you are not going to be able to clean out whatever wound you are dealing with~ so whatever contamination that you might introduce with the gloves would be minor.,1
2160,We don't even use sterile gloves in ambulances,1
2161,Your gloves are to protect you from other peoples bodily fluids~ not to keep someone in a very non-sterile environment from getting dirty,1
2162,Save your money on pre-packaged sterile gloves and just get a box,1
2163,I use them in the garage all the time and keep a few pairs in my trauma kits,1
2164,And the OP's linked gloves will not protect the wearer from pathogens,1
2165,Get some purple nitrile gloves and call it a day,1
2166,Pro tip: If things are looking to get really messy~ double or triple up your gloves so you can peel a layer off if you need to clean hands for a minute and then have to get back at it.,1
2167,Sorry~ I'm a bit late to the party but here's my .02 Don't waste money on sterile gloves~ you are not in a sterile OR doing a procedure so they will do you no good,1
2168,I work in EMS and in an emergency department at a hospital and we use regular old nitrile gloves 99% of the time,1
2169,Before all this covid crap started you could pick up a box at Harbor Freight for just a few bucks,1
2170,Honestly if I am climbing with family or trusted friends I'm not taking the time to glove up before I go to work on them but I do carry a couple pairs of nitrile gloves for when I come across someone I don't know who needs help.,1
2171,Has anyone used the beal birdie for lead rope solo? What has your experience been and how does it compare to other abd's like the gri gri?,1
2172,Haven't roped soloed with it~ but do own a birdie,1
2173,The construction is solid~ but it feels like the cam is a little slower to engage than a grigri~ so that's worth consideration,1
2174,Also definitely use an anti-cross loading carabiner~ BD gridlock is probably the best option.,1
2175,Ryan~ thanks for the reply! Using a gridlock is definately a good idea,1
2176,No worries man,1
2177,Just in case you're not aware the recommended way to load a Birdie (or any camming device) into a gridlock is with the device in the little keeper basket~ the opposite of how you'd load a tuber,1
2178,This keeps the Birdie from being able to get caught on the gate locking mechanism~ which can potentially lead to a torque failure when loaded (here's an example of that with a Spoc).,1
2179,Glad you mentioned that~ I would not have guessed!,1
2180,I'm wanting to start some bouldering projects outside~ and have been looking around online for a pad to save up for,1
2181,The thing is~ there are so many options out there~ and I'm not sure which is worth my $$,1
2182,Any suggestions for a first pad? Or any input on how you went about finding Your first pad? I'm wanting to stay on the cheaper side if possible ($150) and would love to find a pad that's on the easier side to lug around from route to route,1
2183,Thanks in advance! *this has been cross-posted*,1
2184,either buy the cheapest pad you can find (metloious~ or whatever~ on sale for like $100-$120)~ they are all pretty much the same~ or buy an organic~ they are a little better (better foam~ made in usa~ they last longer).,1
2185,I’d checkout the Mad Rock R3,1
2186,It’s a great pad~ environmental friendly~ and pretty affordable,1
2187,It was my first pad and I still have it to this day,1
2188,It’s on the heavier side because of the foam used to filled it~ but it’s definitely a great value,1
2189,Packs down nice~ carries a lot of gear if wanted~ and has a nice coverage area (especially designed for uneven landings),1
2190,When every fall is a ground fall~ spending a little more to keep those ankles intact is worth it~ imho,1
2191,Organic is the way to go,1
2192,Go big is my 2 cents,1
2193,If your only going to have one pad and especially if you are going solo get a big pad~ you can always add smaller ones later,1
2194,My first and only pad is the metolious collosus trifold,1
2195,Best part is it is the exact size of my tent so its like a queen size matress,1
2196,A bigger pad is nice,1
2197,I prefer Metolius pads after having tried a BD one,1
2198,The metolius pads have the extra cloth so when you shove stuff inside the pad while on the approach~ said stuff doesn't fall out,1
2199,I would also recommend seeing if your local shop has pads to rent~ that might be a good way to try one out,1
2200,Otherwise head to a crag with some other boulderers and see what you like,1
2201,I have a Metolius Session and a regular sized Organic Pad~ both good options~ but just picked up this BD Drop Zone at a really good sale price from Backcountry,1
2202,The taco style is helpful when there are weird/jagged landings to cover,1
2203,Also it's larger than standard pads~ but pretty much the same price with this deal (plus Active Junky).,1
2204,Metolious > BD Drop Zone,1
2205,Check craigslist and OfferUp,1
2206,Someone is always selling a pad or 3,1
2207,I just snagged a brand new Mad Pad for $50,1
2208,Kid only used it twice for some very light bouldering.,1
2209,Metolius session is the best starter pad,1
2210,You can find them for cheap~ they have carpet square to wipe your feet off on and they're nice and light,1
2211,The Madrock R3 is super cool and effective but its fucking HEAVY,1
2212,If I remember it weighs like 19 pounds.,1
2213,Well~ I would go for cheap and fits in the car,1
2214,A nice big and thick one is great as the main pad~ add a smaller one to add coverage/cover other boulders you might hit went falling,1
2215,If the pad doesn't have a mat to clean your shoes; just get a cheap floor mat (can be cut in half to save weight/bulk).,1
2216,In my opinion~ just go with an Organic,1
2217,The cheap pads do the job but they wear out fast,1
2218,You may spend a little more on an Organic at first but it will last much longer.,1
2219,Organic!!! At first I started with metolius but very soon after went to organic things last forever definitely worth the extra bucks,1
2220,I rarely boulder right now but when I go I tend to go by myself~ otherwise when I buy a house and move far away from a gym I plan to build a woody,1
2221,Thus need probably more than the one crash pad I have right now,1
2222,I have never seen this crash pad but the pink looks sick any thoughts Black Diamond Circuit ? Or would I be better served waiting and buying a tri-fold on sale? This seems like a killer price,1
2223,I am reopening this thread so if this pad continues to be this cheap~ others can find it.,1
2224,I'm debating myself whether or not to buy this one as my first pad,1
2225,Can anyone else offer any suggestions?,1
2226,I'm debating myself whether or not to buy this one as my first pad,1
2227,Can anyone else offer any suggestions? I bought it it seems similar to the build quality of the cheapest mad rock pad at $50 less so I’m happy,1
2228,I haven’t used it yet but hopefully it holds up!,1
2229,Find a nice and cheap pad online~ in case anyone is interested,1
2230,https://www.geartrade.com/item/653260/x-metolius-party-pit-crash-pad-duck-green-one-size-fair,1
2231,Just released this year~ has anyone looked at it?,1
2232,Yeah~ it’s rad! It’s like a textbook of crack climbing technique,1
2233,It’s super thorough,1
2234,I’d say my crack climbing skill was decent before reading through the book~ but I’ve learned so much from it as far as different variations on techniques that have improved my abilities a lot,1
2235,I’d definitely recommend it!,1
2236,304 pages of jamming,1
2237,Rad,1
2238,I have not looked at it~ but do have The Crack Climber's Technique Manual: Jamming with Finesse Paperback by Kent Pease and thought it was pretty damn informative at 200+ pages,1
2239,I have it on audiobook~ not exactly helpful..,1
2240,It's pretty darn good in my opinion,1
2241,helped alot for my wide technique.,1
2242,It's good,1
2243,Super thorough,1
2244,Almost better for referencing then attempting to read through entirely,1
2245,Which he does state at the beginning,1
2246,I really enjoyed The Crack Climber's Technique Manual (probably more in fact),1
2247,I read through that entire thing,1
2248,But it's less information packed,1
2249,I'd say The Crack Climber's Technique Manual by Kent is your notes from like a college course,1
2250,And Pete's book is like the textbook you reference when confused about said notes.,1
2251,Take the book to the crag to reference while trying,1
2252,You can learn nuggets from the couch but this book is best while out there,1
2253,I guess my plan is either to get this or the CCTM and figure out how to really jam on site,1
2254,My technique sucks and i always go to laying back which just doesn't get the job done,1
2255,There's a steep crack climb that absolutely spanked me a couple of summers ago that could be a nice route to throw a solo top rope on until i get dialed in~ but maybe either book would have a better idea of how to get started.,1
2256,I've only done a single read through~ but I feel it's missing at least a few bits that are in The Crack Climber's Technique Manual,1
2257,"Overall it seems more ""fundamentals"" based~ going deeper into the intricacies of jams~ whereas TCCTM has more of a ""tips and tricks"" feel and focuses more on sequences and full body movement",1
2258,That's just emphasizing the diferrences though~ they both cover the basics pretty thoroughly.,1
2259,+1 for Kent Pease! Be sure to buy it from the publisher (on sale now) or your local shop instead of Amazon,1
2260,That way you benefit the man instead of The Man!,1
2261,Great book,1
2262,I’d say that any of the books published by Mountaineers Books are worth the money,1
2263,Just got my copy and it's awesome,1
2264,Can this please be the new MP like button???,1
2265,I have both this and The Crack Climber's Technique Manual,1
2266,Both are great~ but Pete's book is way more in depth,1
2267,The quality of the illustrations is great in both~ but Pete's takes the cake~ the little arrows indicating how forces are applied in various jams are excellent,1
2268,The Crack Climber's Technique Manual is like a freshman high school book on cracks~ Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide is like a 300s level college textbook.,1
2269,so if you sucked at crack climbing would you get the 100 level or skip to the 300 class? both?,1
2270,so if you sucked at crack climbing would you get the 100 level or skip to the 300 class? both? I suck at crack climbing and got the 300,1
2271,Lol,1
2272,It's easy and clear,1
2273,Already helped a lot,1
2274,Yeah and don't buy it from Walmart online either,1
2275,I tried that and they screwed me with an in-store pickup fiasco.,1
2276,Has anyone actually done this in real life and gotten it to stick?  I find all of the wide fist extensions pretty silly and usually just go into tight butterflies at that size.,1
2277,Has anyone actually done this in real life and gotten it to stick?  I find all of the wide fist extensions pretty silly and usually just go into tight butterflies at that size,1
2278,I may be wrong (still waiting for my copy of the book in the mail) but I believe this technique is only used to hold body tension/readjust body positioning~ not to actually pull on,1
2279,I have used variations of that maneuver several times,1
2280,As Tyler said~ always for stability while I work on something else like getting my feet up,1
2281,I also use wide fist extensions often as a stability jam,1
2282,The one that looks like a squid where your finger tips press on one side and the back of your wrist on the other,1
2283," For what it's worth~ using ""TIMETOREAD"" for a promo code basically gets the buyer free shipping~ so the book is $26 via mountaineers books.Pete Whitakers book that said~ there's a used copy on amazing right now for about $16~ shipped...",1
2284,Just got some Z4's and Z4 offsets and wanted to provide my initial opinion,1
2285,This is my first set of offset cams and no I haven't been outside with them (and probably wont for a while) but in the northwest basalt and volcanic rock I assume they will be quite handy,1
2286,In addition to the offsets~ I got a .5 regular (its what was in stock),1
2287,After playing with them for a little bit~ bending the stems around~ and looking at the lobes I found some interesting things and would be curious if anyone has something similar on their cams,1
2288,Keep in mind~ none of these cams have been outside and were unpackaged about an hour ago,1
2289,.1/.2  trigger: firm and squishy,1
2290,towards the more cammed end~ the trigger is very stiff lobes:  round on both,1
2291,the .1 side lobes look hyperextended,1
2292,the springs on the axle are quite a bit larger in circumference than the axle itself other: not impressed with the trigger~ curious if others have seem similar things on the lobes,1
2293,I've been a fan of my .2/.3~ its slightly larger than the purple/blue Metolius that fits so well in the pnw granite,1
2294,My trigger has remained stiff despite multiple whips,1
2295,Beer Can Test!,1
2296,I'm a not-new but not quite experienced climber looking to buy my first rope (I've been spoiled by a friend group who has had all the gear for a while now) and I'm looking at buying the Beal Karma 9.8 70m rope,1
2297,I'm looking for an affordable rope I can take trad and sport climbing on lead and some occasional top rope,1
2298,Any reviews or suggestions?,1
2299,I haven’t used that specific Karma rope by Beal~ but I’ve used and abused 2 of their 10.0mm Tiger~ 2 x  9.1mm Joker~ and 1x of their skinny Iceline double ropes and I’ve always been very impressed,1
2300,Beal has become my number one rope brand now.,1
2301,I have that exact rope,1
2302,I like it,1
2303,2 years in and it's holding up well,1
2304,The price was fantastic and the handling qualities are top notch,1
2305,9.8 mm is a good diameter for a first rope,1
2306,Beal is a reputable manufacturer than makes good ropes,1
2307,An affordable 9.8 from Beal..,1
2308,should be a good choice,1
2309,I have this rope,1
2310,It does what it’s supposed to do with no problems,1
2311,Pretty durable too.Ropes get beat up and need to be replaced relatively often if you’re using them a lot,1
2312,Buy the cheapest rope available at your desired diameter - that’s my 2c,1
2313,I fell into the trap of buying a $200+ rope with all the bells and whistles,1
2314,Turns out that I don’t climb when it’s raining,1
2315,Plus~ I spent more time babying my rope than climbing.I do like a middle marker~ though.,1
2316,Mammut Revelation 9.2 versus Beal Joker 9.1,1
2317,I have an Opera 8.5~ so far so good~ not enough time on it to tell,1
2318,A Mammut Infinity 9.5 that has lasted forever but its time is drawing nigh,1
2319,Both handle quite well,1
2320,I will still use my Opera or a half rope for long approach easy stuff,1
2321,And I have a couple 10mm-ish cords for workhorse use,1
2322,But the Revelation or Joker will likely be my daily driver for cragging~ and moderate approach multipitch,1
2323,So which one should I get? Or does the MP hivemind recommend another?,1
2324,60m? Beal based on pricehttps://shop.epictv.com/en/products/single-ropes?f%5B0%5D=field_brand%3A1047 sign up for $5 off first purchase too hard to beat those prices (I've bought a few things from them in the last 6 months~ they're legit,1
2325,Use a credit card with no FOREX fee if you have one~ otherwise figure 3% more),1
2326,Pricewise~ I can get the Revelation for a bit cheaper than the Beal,1
2327,I will get a 70m or 80m,1
2328,I am mainly curious which is the better rope.,1
2329,I have a Revelation,1
2330,Typically great Mammut rope,1
2331,If you like your Infinity 9.5 it's like that~ only thinner and a bit more slippery (mine is dry coated).,1
2332,I really like my Sterling 9.2 if you're looking for another option,1
2333,It's called the Evolution Aero.,1
2334,I do like the idea behind unicore ropes but honestly~ I’ve never owned one,1
2335,I’m working on changing that,1
2336,I’ve also never jumped on the Mammut bandwagon like most,1
2337,In my opinion ( I’ve owned several [infinity~ revelation~ serenity]) they handle well but aren’t as durable as Bluewater Icon (9.1) or Wave (9.3) which are my favorite ropes ever and my only beef with is the sheath slippage,1
2338,I’ve almost considered getting a Joker but I always remember that one time a dude unpacked a brand new Beal Joker at the base of the Yellow Spur~ climbed~ fell~ and died after his rope cut,1
2339,I had a Joker that I liked quite a bit—no complaints,1
2340,It was a very good rope,1
2341,B+ or A- from me,1
2342,But I prefer the Mammut lineup for handling and durability,1
2343,I’ve never been on a rope with better handling.I haven’t used a Revelation~ though~ just an Infinity and an Eternity,1
2344,My next rope will be the Revelation,1
2345,Don~ there’s a bit of humor in describing Mammut’s broad fan base as a bandwagon,1
2346,They’ve been around for~ you know~ a while,1
2347,I am very disappointed that I was not greeted with a jerry-rigged tension tester that would pull two ropes in series to see which broke first~ possibly with a metal cage over the top giving it that thunder-dome vibe,1
2348,Again~ I am very disappointed,1
2349,Misleading title,1
2350,Need to watch Mad Max.,1
2351,Wow~ not to derail the thread but do you have a link to more information on that? Ropes cutting and rockfall are two scary things (not saying there was rockfall involved~ just the two things that scare me in rock climbing).,1
2352,No experience with either but I have been shopping for a similar rope lately and have given some thought to both of these options,1
2353,It came down to weight for me,1
2354,In a 70 m the Joker is going to be about 12 ounces lighter,1
2355,I ruled out the revelation because it's not that much lighter than the infinity,1
2356,Maybe I'm missing something but trading off the durability advantages of the infinity to go 5 ounces lighter (on a 70m) with the revelation didn't make sense to me,1
2357,I know every ounce counts but the trade off just didn't seem worth it,1
2358,I have a Revelation and have not been super happy with it:  it started out kinky and never got un-kinky,1
2359,In the old days I'd be accused~ rightly or wrongly~ of not properly unwinding it the first time I used it~ but this rope is sold lap coiled or whatever they call it so you apparently don't need to engage in any particular unwinding,1
2360,And it feels a bit stiff for my tastes~ although that may be just user preference,1
2361,Ropes are strange:  it seems that different people have different experiences in terms of kinks~ longevity~ and other characteristics with the same model of rope~ so I'm not surprised that other people have had a different experience with a Revelation~ and I'm not strongly opposed to the rope or anything,1
2362,Just of the many ropes I've owned over the years~ I'd put my Revelation on the lower end of how much I like it,1
2363,On the other hand~ the two Beal ropes I've owned have probably been my two least favorite ropes :),1
2364,I recently saw some Infinities on Backcountry.com for about 40% off,1
2365,Might be worth looking into,1
2366,I found this but it makes no mention of what rope he was using,1
2367,Beal Joker sticks in my mind for some reason,1
2368,I'm sure there is an MP thread on it somewhere.,1
2369,Link doesn't work.,1
2370,You didn't say what type of climbing you 'll be doing,1
2371,I am a huge fan of my Sterling Fusion Ion R 9.4mm for everything except top roping,1
2372,Kind of a do-it-all rope in a decent weight/diameter,1
2373,My buddy has the Sterling Evolution Helix (9.5mm)~ which is almost identical to the Fusion series but claims it is lighter??? I think they are both good ropes,1
2374,I have a Sterling Marathon 10.5mm from 1998 that is still going strong~ for non climbing purposes.,1
2375,Link doesn't work,1
2376,I believe this is the incident Don Ferris is referring to~ but in the article~ post-accident investigation said it was an abraded slicing of the rope~ possibly a pendulum over an edge which caused the failure,1
2377,But~ perhaps I'm reading it incorrectly~ so check it out:,1
2378,Revelation will be more durable~ Joker will be softer catches~ lighter~ and I like the handfeel better,1
2379,I've been using a Petzl Volta recently~ which is my first experience with Petzl ropes~ and have been pretty impressed,1
2380,Similar stats to the Revelation~ with higher sheath % and a little lighter,1
2381,Out of the 3 brands my favorite ropes have come from Beal~ with Petzl making a strong case currently,1
2382,But any of the options would do you just fine~ as I'm sure you're aware,1
2383,Still fun to split hairs though,1
2384,In Eldo~ it was definitely a substantial pendulum over a long length of sharp rock that cut the rope,1
2385,I would not fault the rope,1
2386,No rope could have withstood that.,1
2387,Per your original question:   I've had both those ropes and absolutely prefer the Joker,1
2388,In fact the Joker has quickly become one of my favorite ropes I've ever had,1
2389,Super durable~ and Unicore is pretty awesome,1
2390,Generally speaking I do love Mammut ropes~ but I had the same experience as someone else up thread where the Revelation just never broke in the way I wanted it to,1
2391,I wonder if the Revelations just aren’t as good as the Infinity,1
2392,I’ve heard several complaints about the former~ none about the latter.,1
2393,Except for maybe a fatter~ tougher rope with a high sheath percentage but yeah I wouldn’t exactly fault the rope here either,1
2394,I just always think about it when I pull the trigger on a new 9mm lead line,1
2395,Unjustifiably puts a bad taste in my mouth,1
2396,I'll mainly~ but not exclusively~ be climbing UP,1
2397,I have started using half ropes for most ice climbing,1
2398,I will be using thicker cords for the couple walls I intend to do this spring/summer,1
2399,I have a Beal Opera for long approaches and alpine,1
2400,So this rope will get used for sport and trad that is relatively close to the car~ or longer approaches where I think I have a decent chance of taking some falls~ or anything I need a long cord for (I plan on getting a 70m or 80m),1
2401,I've never owned a Revelation~ but the Infinity is my go-to affordable gold standard and I just bought a joker,1
2402,I love the joker,1
2403,It handles really well~ but I'm not sure how long it'll last,1
2404,That's not to say I don't think it'll last a long time -- it actually feels like it will,1
2405,I just can't say yet,1
2406,I had a nondry treated Aero that I loved but I beat the shit out of it and it ended up too short to use pretty quickly,1
2407,I'd say I get more whips out of the Infinity than I did the Aero~ but that could be any number of thins.,1
2408,I'm pretty much an aid climber these days~ and a longtime fan of Bluewater,1
2409,The extra weight of a thicker rope doesn't bother me when I am someplace extremely exposed,1
2410,Ryan~ I'm curious~ why are you considering the 80m? What are you planning on using it for?,1
2411,There are a lot of climbs that an 80m is helpful for at Pine Creek~ ORG~ City of Rocks~ Indian Creek...,1
2412,I’ve owned both ropes and still occasionally use the revelation after 6+ years,1
2413,The joker is long gone,1
2414,(Despite being purchased later than the revelation),1
2415,Just curious~ does anyone ever think about their partners~ when picking ropes? What handles best in the device they are accustomed to? Weight differences and rope stretch? Etc? I don't recall a single comment~ ever..,1
2416,sure~ we should be able to handle anything you put in our hands~ but some ropes are just awful to be stuck with on the nonsharp end,1
2417,Just a question~ truly! I am a newish climber~ and different ropes have been very ​different to belay with,1
2418,My first visit to COR (Castle~ actually) climbing on Poptart is why I bought a 70 for my first rope,1
2419,It's pretty interesting needing to climb part way up~ to have enough rope to tie in! Best~ Helen,1
2420,It's a good question~ actually,1
2421,Maybe starting a new thread is called for~ in fact,1
2422,I think if one is thinking about the ropes brought up in this thread it's most likely crossing people's minds,1
2423,At least you'd know what belay device/s your partner/s have and whether they have a device that meets the criteria for thinner ropes,1
2424,Maybe you know if they are gear adverse or not and whether they be willing to buy a new belay device~ if needed,1
2425,They'd probably be climbing with partners who are willing to go thin or climb with twins and understand what's involved with that~ including how to rappel on them and how thin ropes feed and handle etc,1
2426,They'd probably have fatter rope/s for use with beginners for sport and TR etc,1
2427,"and save these for more ""advanced"" climbing",1
2428,They'd have enough experience to trust who to use these with and who to use something else with (or just not care cause they trust everyone and or have no amygdala.)  They are probably talking about the ropes with their partners~ for buying advice~ before they buy but~ are wanting more advice from the community to help them make a better decision; especially since new ropes come out all the time,1
2429,And~ well~ none of this crosses anyone's mind and it gets figured out after the fact,1
2430,That happens too~ I'm sure,1
2431,Max~ good to know! I have a Mammut Infinity and that thing handles great and wears like iron,1
2432,Have heard great things about the Serenity~ and have used one~ although I don't own one,1
2433,I had heard that maybe the Revelation is different construction and isn't as good~ but maybe that isn't the case! Helen~ I do think about partners when buying ropes~ but not too much typically,1
2434,I give a lot more thought to my partner and their device when picking a rope from the quiver for a given climb,1
2435,And we communicate about this as well,1
2436,Relatively speaking~ a lot more money goes into a ropes than belay devices,1
2437,They cost more initially and wear faster,1
2438,There are several fun climbs at the City which require shenanigans with a 60m~ but can be rapped or lowered from very simply with a 70 or 80m,1
2439,Tie a knot! I am really looking forward to climbing there again this fall!,1
2440,Sorry~ it looks like this is my week to resurrect old threads,1
2441,Just wanted to comment here because I've been researching ropes~ and someone else might find this comment the same way I did,1
2442,I'm pretty sure that Yellow Spur accident was not with a Beal Joker,1
2443,The accident report (looking at the 15-page PDF version) doesn't name the rope but says it was a 9.7mm Beal,1
2444,The Joker is 9.1mm~ not 9.7,1
2445,Also~ the accident report makes no mention of the unicore sheath-to-core bonding technology that the Joker ropes use~ which seems like it would be worthy of mention since protecting the rope from severing in a cutting scenario is unicore's sole purpose,1
2446,I'm not an expert on this~ but the photos of the damaged climber's rope don't appear to be a unicore rope.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/552e8f43e4b07f0b3920027b/t/566b4b8869a91af72b2a1640/1449872264027/YellowSpur2010v6.pdf Based on the color of the climber's rope in the accident report photos~ I'm thinking it was the Beal Booster Golden Dry~ which does not have unicore,1
2447,https://www.ems.com/beal-booster-9.7-mm-x-60-m-golden-dry-climbing-rope/1313089.html  Note - the report specifically says there's no reason to believe this rope was flawed or more susceptible to cutting than other normal ropes,1
2448,It was just a terribly unlucky scenario where the rope got pinched while the climber pendulumed~ sliding the weighted rope across an edge,1
2449,Having a regular climbing partner is so 1989,1
2450,Can’t remember the last time I climbed with the same person more than a couple consecutive days,1
2451,Thanks for the tip,1
2452,Looks like a one-product company,1
2453,Had never heard of them before,1
2454,Just wrote them~ suggesting they offer a short~ but wide version.,1
2455,I have never had great luck with these light inflatable type pads,1
2456,I use a Paco pad in my truck~ and a regular thermarest when backpacking,1
2457,I had a Klymit that leaked after four nights in a basecamp setting~ I would not trust my life to an inflatable pad in any sort of alpine environment,1
2458,Might be an ok cheap pad,1
2459,See below for a rambling opinion.The biggest thing that would turn me off of it is the lack of an R value/any insulation info,1
2460,It just says “no heat loss” which is just a false statement,1
2461,Also~ as a side sleeper these ultra thin pads are a nightmare,1
2462,I do really like the integral pillow idea though,1
2463,Overall take: it’s probably a mass produced import,1
2464,That being said it might be great! But usually even great cheap imports are plagued by quality issues To back up the import theory: amazon.com/ZOOOBELIVES-Ultr…,1
2465,Every once in a while you crack me up Frank.,1
2466,According to the website~ the R value is 4.2.,1
2467,According to the website~ the R value is 4.2,1
2468,Ah~ my refrigerator blindness must have been in full effect,1
2469,Good call.,1
2470,I have had the opposite in that my klymit pad probably has at least 200 nights on it,1
2471,I think for how cheap you can get them they make awesome pads if you have good luck like me I guess.,1
2472,Looks like a poor design in my opinion,1
2473,"All those areas in between the raised ""bubbles"" will leak heat",1
2474,Klymit pads do this too~ it's why they're never as warm as their R value suggests compared to eg Thermarest,1
2475,Think of a box baffled VS sewn thru down jacket,1
2476,Klymit always claimed your sleeping bag lofted and filled in the gaps but that's wishful thinking,1
2477,Have you still not resealed your NeoAirs? :-) Just attack the seam with some Thermarest adhesive if you don't want to go near it with an iron again,1
2478,Have you still not resealed your NeoAirs? :-) Just attack the seam with some Thermarest adhesive if you don't want to go near it with an iron again,1
2479,Ha! Thanks for remembering,1
2480,Both the Neolite and the Uberlite were successfully resealed- with the iron! Still~ I like seeing new products,1
2481,I'm a certfied gear hoarder.,1
2482,Has anyone had a chance to try these out? I'm wondering how well they penetrate ice being only 480 grams? Also~ is the fully carbon handle suspect to breaking if dropped while mixed climbing? Overall they look awesome and seem like they would be a great tool for alpine given their light weight and new pick/accessory options.,1
2483,Unless someone managed a demo last season it will still be a bit before anyone can give feedback,1
2484,I checked with Liberty Mountain (distributor for grivel) last week and they hadn't received them yet,1
2485,Currently they don't show the item yet either~ but it sounds like the first batch might all go out to retailers who pre ordered,1
2486,I've been trying to get my hands on a pair too,1
2487,"US distributor still doesn't have them~ they told me they expect a limited ""first batch"" soon but no dates and can't say which retailers they'll go to",1
2488,UK distributor received them today~ should be in stores there 1-2 weeks,1
2489,I'll order from across the pond if there are no news stateside by Black Friday,1
2490,I'm psyched to try them,1
2491,I've had rotator cuff issues on both sides~ hoping the light weight is kinder,1
2492,The North Machines (also light) are much easier to swing than my Petzl tools though I haven't used them on enough cold~ brittle ice to comment on penetration.,1
2493,Excited to hear what you think of them.,1
2494,I’ve tried the north machines and found that they didn’t penetrate as well as the quarks~ as though the head needed a bit more weight behind it,1
2495,I wonder if the new dark machines will be the same,1
2496,I haven't tried them yet~ but I can probably answer your questions about as well as anyone that didn't design or use the tools,1
2497,Has anyone been able to find these yet?,1
2498,Nope,1
2499,I thought I had a pair from an online shop in the UK~ my credit card got charged but then I got an apologetic email the next morning saying someone else had ordered their only pair just before me,1
2500,UK distributor is out~ no ETA on the next batch,1
2501,I've not seen them for sale in the US yet and I can't find a pair anywhere in Europe - I've searched UK~ France~ Italy,1
2502,Kinda lame but the firstest of first world problems~ to be sure :-),1
2503,I haven't tried them yet~ but I can probably answer your questions about as well as anyone that didn't design or use the tools,1
2504,Curious - from my time playing hockey I know carbon fiber to be extremely resilient and resistant to breaking~ but when it does break~ it does so very unexpectedly,1
2505,Curious - from my time playing hockey I know carbon fiber to be extremely resilient and resistant to breaking~ but when it does break~ it does so very unexpectedly,1
2506,I don't think it is very common for modern carbon fiber composite tools to break,1
2507,I haven't heard of anyone breaking the shaft of the north machine carbon or tech machine carbon,1
2508,I have seen some delamination between the carbon fiber composite and the underlying aluminum~ but not an actual failure,1
2509,I don't think it is likely that a carbon wrapped aluminum shaft (i.e.~ north machine carbon) will unexpectedly fail in a catastrophic way~ without someone first noticing that the tool was severely damaged,1

2513,I don't think it is likely that a carbon wrapped aluminum shaft (i.e.~ north machine carbon) will unexpectedly fail in a catastrophic way~ without someone first noticing that the tool was severely damaged,1
2514,Didn't know the north machine had an aluminum core! TIL!  The first one scenario is the one I'd imagine breaking an all carbon shaft,1
2515,Yikes,1
2516,Anybody whos witnessed somebody smash a composite shaft on a goal post knows what I mean,1
2517,That being said~ I'm sure the ice climbing tools are built to a different standard,1
2518,They seem hefty for carbon fiber,1
2519,Liberty Mountain had a note of 12-6 ETA on the dark machines for a bit now~ logged in today and 0 quantity shows and the eta note is gone,1
2520,This was the response back I had from them in early November: We have some Dark Machines coming in stock in the next couple weeks~ but not our full shipment of them so I’m not sure how many will still be available after our pre-orders are shipped out,1
2521,I know that’s not a great answer~ we will be receiving more in after the initial shipment but we do not have the ETA yet for the remainder,1
2522,My best advice would be to check in a couple weeks to see if we have any after the preorders have gone out.,1
2523,I'm not sure what to think of these stories of carbon tools breaking,1
2524,Grivel use to make a tool called the Carbon Race (maybe Monster Race)~ there's even a video on youtube with Steve House soloing some climbs back east,1
2525,Also~ Grivel isn't the first to make all carbon tools; Eliteclimb(Polish) and Icerock(Russian) have been at it for awhile,1
2526,Also~ weren't some of the later generation Lowe Alpine Big Bird and Hummingbirds available with carbon shafts? But~But~ if one has ever cruised Neptune's in Boulder~ what about all those broken tools being used for benches? I think aluminum is used primarily because it's cheap~ pliable and light;another curious thing is why would BD use stainless on their old Reactors? I have an Eliteclimb Salamandra; incredibly light~ and so far~ so good,1
2527,I also have an Icerock Idol~ (carbon)which is just too beautiful to take out and bash,1
2528,Both of these tools are UIAA rated.,1
2529,You're kidding~ right?,1
2530,You're kidding~ right?  Nope~ with a bit of tremor in my voice.,1
2531,Got a chance to put a couple of pitch's on the Dark Machines last week,1
2532,They swing and penetrate great,1
2533,The center of balance is much closer to the head than other tools so it feels like you are swinging a tool with pick weights on it but they carry much lighter,1
2534,Hope that makes sense,1
2535,I was impressed,1
2536,Highly probability it will be my next tool.,1
2537,The ice screw sculpture was made from donated Ti screws from (probably) Ushba and they were twisted and bent by Jeff Skoloda an artistic welder in Ouray,1
2538,The bench was made from retired Trango demo gear that we gave to Skoloda in 1995,1
2539,Some of the picks were from a batch of recalled picks that we were about to recycle,1
2540,Mal,1
2541,Where did they get them? Was it a demo?,1
2542,One of the Grivel athletes had then at the Bozeman Ice Fest.,1
2543,Mal,1
2544,Mal I think Skoloda made a few benches and sculptures,1
2545,The one in front Neptune is all old Trango gear,1
2546,The vertical members are stacked and welded Pyramids~ the arms are Captain Hooks and the webbing is from demo Trango Vertical harnesses.,1
2547,I got a chance to fondle and swing the tools at Ouray Mountain Sports,1
2548,Here are my initial thoughts,1
2549,Despite the relatively low overall weight~ the swing feels head heavy~ more similar to a Nomic with head weights than either the Tech Machine or North Machine Carbon,1
2550,The tool rotates easily around the pinky finger,1
2551,There is no “cup” or trigger to facilitate rotating the tool around the index finger,1
2552,The handle is long and should accommodate any hand width comfortably.The front of the lower handle is very wide and flat (very similar width and shape to the Petzl Ergonomic),1
2553,I have the Ergonomics and personally do not like the wide~ flat front of the lower handle,1
2554,I prefer the narrower / more rounded lower handles of the North Machine Carbon~ Nomic~ Tech Machine~ and X-Dream,1
2555,The upper grip position with over molded rubber is very comfortable and the tools feel very nimble and easy to control~ when using the secondary grip,1
2556,In my opinion~ this feels like the best upper grip on the market,1
2557,I wish Grivel had used the same geometry and rubber on the lower handle.TL/DR: The Dark Machine seems like it will be a great option for both ice and mixed climbing~ if you like the relatively wide and flat shape of the lower handle,1
2558,I'm based in the UK and have just replaced my battered metal shafted tech machines,1
2559,The only flaw with the Techs was the handle as it was too small and the rubber grips on my pair were failing,1
2560,Grivel have addressed this with the Darks~ the carbon handle has perfect clearance and geometry,1
2561,The handle certainly feels sturdy enough and overall integrity feels first class,1
2562,During two days use in Scotland I encountered no issues with any aspect of the design and certainly no flex or creaking from the carbon handle,1
2563,I haven't had a chance to play around with the modular head/adze/hammer combo but I've reason to suspect they'll work flawlessly,1
2564,Pros                                                                                        Cons,1
2565,@piers,1
2566,You did well getting some in the Uk before they sold out,1
2567,How did you manage that lol,1
2568,Pros                                                                                        Cons   To put this in perspective~ they cost less than a good pair of AT skis~ will last longer and won't go out of fashion in 2 years.,1
2569,To put this in perspective~ they cost less than a good pair of AT skis~ will last longer and won't go out of fashion in 2 years,1
2570,Well said!,1
2571,I finally got to put some miles on them and I agree with what Piers said,1
2572,I was worried that the bare handles would be slick~ but they’ve added just a little bit of texture and I think it works pretty well,1
2573,Take a look a the picture,1
2574,We can see the handle and the grip.verticallstore.com/GRIVEL_D…,1
2575,Further update..........Just had a further two days in Scotland with my Dark Machines on Minus Three Gully and Minus Two Gully,1
2576,I'm very impressed with what Grivel have done with these,1
2577,Great Geometry and clearance with superb picks and build quality,1
2578,Top tip.........Used the retro fit hammers and I would suggest the Micro Hammers over the heavier weight Hammers,1
2579,As well as making the tools more versatile~ they add a little head weight without affecting the swing,1
2580,I use North Machines which are only 450g and they penetrate ice just as well as nomics (which i also have) ..,1
2581,So i would not worry about it..,1
2582,Also climbing on a set of Grivel Dark Machine X's,1
2583,Excellent for very steep and overhanging,1
2584,The mid tape is for bite holding at the gym,1
2585,Last night at the Ice Coop in Boulder.,1
2586,Kristian~ where did you get them?,1
2587,I've had a couple days on Dark Machines in the Northeast,1
2588,Overall I'm psyched~ like I mentioned previously I've struggled with shoulder issues and I think with hundreds of swings in a day the light weight really helps me,1
2589,That said my impression is that (predictably) Petzls with pick weights and Pur'ice picks (factory setup on the latest Nomics) do penetrate cold/brittle ice better,1
2590,Definitely bounced in a couple of spots that I don't think my Nomics would have,1
2591,I wouldn't necessarily bring the Nomics instead because for me over the course of a typical day I think the Grivels are a net plus~ but in some spots you might miss the Petzls,1
2592,I will try the Grivel total ice vario picks when I find some~ that may be next season though,1
2593,Edit: just want to add that they are very well balanced and the weight is appropriately biased towards the head,1
2594,It's not a balance issue (like on a set of Petzls if you remove the pick weights),1
2595,On most ice the Grivels are magic~ there just comes a point where the ice sucks and more weight helps,1
2596,If you've climbed on a set of North Machines they're very similar~ these just have a nice handle to hang onto for steep stuff,1
2597,Thoughts on X vs,1
2598,non-X? What I've compiled so far:,1
2599,I've had my hands on the X but haven't actually climbed on it,1
2600,Have you ever used a tool with that aggressive of a handle/angle? What kind of mixed are you thinking of? I would have to be climbing pretty steep rock regularly and very little else to consider it over the regular DM which is a better rounded tool,1
2601,With that said it's very personal and I've met competent climbers who have been doing everything including easy ice with Petzl Ergos (by choice) for years,1
2602,See if you can put hands on the X's in a shop at least~ or maybe swing a friend's similarly aggressive tools (X dreams~ Ergonomics),1
2603,In the US~ you can call Grivel's distributor Liberty Mountain,1
2604,They have a pretty good idea about where/when stock is located,1
2605,I never expected to want or need tools this aggressive,1
2606,They are instantly a must have now,1
2607,(In fact~ I was doing alpine WI5 on Petzl Gully tools to save on weight,1
2608,),1
2609,Is the dark x geometry similar to the new petzl ergonomic,1
2610,These tools are absolutely fantastic! Potentially the best balanced one on the market! Stunning in steep ice and secure and stable in mixed—- climbed wi5/6 and up to M8/9 in them!! Can absolutely recommend!,1
2611,Question here~ has anyone else experienced a change in attitude by Arc'teryx in their evaluation of gear for warranty repair and replacement since they started their used gear sales offerings?  In my prior experience they would either repair or replace gear that had obviously failed as a result of construction as opposed to mis-use (the core vent zippers on my Alpha SV delaminated and detached from the body of the shell),1
2612,Now they seem to involve an arbitrary Practical Product Lifespan standard and offer to sell replacement gear at 50% or wholesale,1
2613,To me~ this change uncannily coincides with their offering to sell used gear,1
2614," Are they monetizing this on the backs of their loyal customers by offering a ""deal"" at 50% off retail and then repairing and reselling the equipment",1
2615,My cynical suspicions tell me that they are,1
2616," I guess if I acquire more Act'teryx shells~ I will need to go over the ""welding"" with a healthy dose of aqua seal (just like the old tents) to make sure the gear doesn't fail in the middle of some gnar.....",1
2617,I found some of the Goretex delaminating on my older pair of Alpha AR pants,1
2618,I dropped them off at an Arc’teryx store~ and a few weeks later I got a voucher for the retail price of current Alpha AR’s~ no questions asked,1
2619,This was a couple months ago,1
2620,YMMV.,1
2621,I had a 2 year old alpha AR replaced for some small holes and snags in the fabric,1
2622,No questions asked,1
2623,Brand new jacket,1
2624,Face fabric on a Theta AR jacket delaminated 8 months ago Got a voucher for the price of its successor~ Beta SV~ no questions asked,1
2625,Just told them what I wanted,1
2626,Great service.,1
2627,I gashed my Alpha FL with an ice screw and sent it off to Arc’Teryx for repair~ at my cost,1
2628,They contacted me weeks later saying they’d detected minor delamination around the zipper,1
2629,Gave me credit for a new Alph FL,1
2630,top notch customer service IMO,1
2631,This was 2 years ago,1
2632,I just had the same thing happen as the OP,1
2633,Sent in my Alpha SV after it fell apart around the cuffs and skirt,1
2634,They offered me 50% off retail,1
2635,I was surprised as I’ve always had great experiences in the past with them,1
2636,I’ll most likely be picking up my next jacket from OR,1
2637,You should pick up your next jacket from patagucci if you want to do business with a company that will honor their word.,1
2638,Their shit warranty has been in effect since at least 2 years ago.,1
2639,my friend just shipped in 12year old bib that had a problem with snow gaiters separating from the main fabric and they offered credit for the full value as it was clear that the pants have not been used much..,1
2640,Got my cerium LT replaced for $40 shipping included when it was pretty thrashed after ~4 years of regular use,1
2641,No complaints here,1
2642,I've heard there are some QC issues on the jackets that are laminated? Hardshells~ basically,1
2643,Idk though~ don't have any of those.,1
2644,The drawstring on my arc'teryx chalk bag tore out of the fabric after 10 years of ownership,1
2645,I contacted customer service to see if they would repair it,1
2646,I was initially confused~ but they asked me to cut the bag into pieces and send them a photo,1
2647,They sent me a new bag asap after I emailed them a photo of my newly mangled bag,1
2648,Seemed pretty wasteful,1
2649,They also warrantied an Atom LT 2 years ago with no questions asked,1
2650,Can't really complain.,1
2651,You should pick up your next jacket from patagucci if you want to do business with a company that will honor their word,1
2652,I've never had Pata honor their warranty,1
2653,I've sent back a few used things (including a completely delaminated H2No hardshell that retailed for $450 or so at the time,1
2654,They gave me $70 store credit,1
2655,Yippee,1
2656,I've never had an issue with OR,1
2657,They're great in terms of returns,1
2658,I'd much prefer to support Pata's sustainability initiatives~ fair-trade push~ etc,1
2659,though so I just buy knowing they don't have a water-tight return policy~ no pun intended.,1
2660,Had an alpha fl~ had it for about 2 years but mostly sat in the closet hung up and un used~ used for 2 months in the alps in the summer~ leaked at a seam that fall~ sent it to arcteryx and the said the membrane had been contaminated and wouldn't warranty it~ got them to send it to goretex and they honoured their gaurenteed to keep you dry,1
2661,Arcteryx has fixed zippers on my and my wife's 7+ year old Atoms~ both I think within the last couple years~ for free minus the cost of me shipping to them,1
2662,I haven't noticed any downhill in product repair/replacement but I'm scared about the future as they definitely seem to be going the way of the North Face with all their advertising and the fact that their clothes are just a status symbol nowadays,1
2663,As far as Patagonia goes~ I brought in a pair of jeans that were worn through in the butt and a knee asking if they'd be able to repair them,1
2664,They weren't but gave me a gift card for what I paid for them,1
2665,They've also fixed small issues on my wife's fleece jacket like missing buttons~ burn holes~ etc,1
2666,I'm pretty confident in them.,1
2667,My old Kata 45 had some broken buckles and one shoulder strap was starting to tear out,1
2668,I took it in and they offered to repair it (weeks away) or send me a new one of equivalent value so I picked the Alpha AR 55,1
2669,Quite like it except for the fiddly loop and hook things it has to fasten down the top.,1
2670,If I send in my hammered harness will they replace the worn out tie in points? Would rather fix than trash.,1
2671,I have an old (made in Canada) jacket that some of the seams were delaminated where they were once glued,1
2672,Due to the age they discounted it as wear and tear and would not warranty it,1
2673,to add to the discussion: I just warrantied my old~ used but not abused Theta AR that had delamed around the wrist and the waist pull cord,1
2674,They offered to repair or replace it without a hitch,1
2675,took a some time but otherwise no other issues,1
2676,I have bought~ used~  thrashed~ worn out and torn up~ quite a bit of Arcteryx (and many other brands’!) gear over the years,1
2677,Warranty on most used to be amazing - no questions asked~ pretty much,1
2678,"More recently~ here is how I would characterize my experience in the past couple years or so with a sample of a few: Patagonia: ""Of course! We are so delighted that you are a customer and totally stand behind our gear",1
2679,"We can repair this one for you~ that one is too badly abused~ so we'll replace it~ and this one is 20 years old and has lived a great life~ so we'll give you some reasonably prorated store credit for it."" OR:  [I send in pictures",1
2680,"Warranty guy thinks to himself: Dude~ clearly you thrashed these gloves and let's be real~ they are mixed climbing gloves with pittards and you did a lot of rappelling in them and that's not the intended use.] And writes ""Those look pretty worn",1
2681,"But if you haven't had them for very long why don't you send those in and we can have a look at them."" I read his thoughts and respond ""No worries~ thanks for taking a look",1
2682,"I'm good and I’ll just buy a new pair."" A new pair of gloves shows up the next week~ to my great surprise",1
2683,"Arcteryx: ""Well~ we'll repair or replace it~ but only grudgingly and with a 6-12 week wait~ and don't forget we're doing you a huge favor and I'm making an exception this time."" [Just my sense of the attitude of the reps I've engaged with over email~ almost like they are trying to signal to me to back off on my warranty inquiries",1
2684,But I may be overly sensitive on this.],1
2685,It's important to acknowledge that these companies have no obligation to stand behind their gear in what I would see as far above and beyond expectations in any other sport or activity I've been involved with,1
2686,My comments above are solidly #firstworldproblems and I receive all of the repaired or replaced goods with some sense of amazement and gratitude every time,1
2687,That said~ the warranty these companies explicitly promise~ and the reputation they gain for interpreting their own policies loosely and generously~ is I believe part of their offering~ and part of how they justify a significant price premium,1
2688,Also~ it's good business for them to keep the hard core users/influencers happy since so much of what they sell including technical gear goes to light hikers~ around town users~ or light volume users,1
2689,For my part~ I pay the price premium because I like pimped out gear~ but I do so with the expectation that it will last~ sometimes through multiple patches and incarnations,1
2690,I would guess that Arcteryx has been bought by a big conglomerate or something in recent years~ and serves its investors as much as it does its core users now~ but that's speculation,1
2691,Amer sports which is now owned by Anta sports~ big Chinese firm,1
2692," Hey all With some of the recent threads about rescues and the AAC podcast encouraging a 2 way system rather than a ""push button and hope"" I've been thinking to upgrade",1
2693,I have an older spot device (v3 i think) with the non 2 way functionality,1
2694,I know spot have a 2 way now~ but I was leaning towards inreach because it sounded like their network was better,1
2695,I then noticed there was also a new garmin G66i~ this seems like the future for garmin to integrate inreach functionality into more of their existing GPS lines,1
2696,SO it seems like: Inreach Mini $350 + sub - Requires phone to text message - I don't like to rely on a 2nd piece of hardware that may run out of batteries or break,1
2697,Inreach Explorer + $450 +sub - Gives you everything the mini does plus poor GPS/mapping functionality and I believe you can still message albeit slowly without using the app? Garmin G66i $600 + sub - seems to combine the inreach explorer + functionality into a possibly better GPS Is this fair? Can you actually text with just the explorer+ if your phone is dead?  Also has anyone tried the new garmin unit?  Is the GPS decent as a standalone?  Is the inreach functionality the same?  I have an old  garmin oregon but it goes through batteries and the screen is dreadful so it might be nice to combine functionality and get rid of that.,1
2698,You can text on the mini without a phone~ it is just tedious,1
2699,Since I always have a phone with me and could go without in an emergency~ I find Iran acceptable compromise.,1
2700,You can text with the Explorer + using the toggle,1
2701,It's not as fast as using a phone~ but it is decent,1
2702,Also~ the maps/GPS capabilities on the + aren't bad~ depending on what you want,1
2703,I bought mine as an emergency device~ and limit its use (e.g,1
2704,off on a 43 day remote trip--I did not want to use up its batteries),1
2705,I used a Garmin eTrex 20 for GPSing~ but we used maps for the trip--GPS was for befuddlement and entertainment (e.g,1
2706,how fast were we sailing?),1
2707,Simon~ you can text from the Inreach Mini without a phone,1
2708,I have one and really like it,1
2709,"You can set up preset messages like ""I'm safely in camp""~ or ""Made the summit"" or ""Running late~ don't worry"" that shortcut a lot of the tedious entering of letters",1
2710,"It also has a preset ""yes"" and ""no"" so in an emergency you can easily answer questions from emergency services folks who are texting with you",1
2711,The think with both the Explorer + and the new G66 is that they pretty much suck as navigation devices compared to just using an iPhone or a an Android phone with GaiaGPS or Garmin's own software~ Earthmate,1
2712,My system is that I use an iphone (in airplane mode most of the time) running GaiaGPS for my navigation app,1
2713,The Inreach Mini is just clipped to my backpack or harness in case of an oh-shit emergency,1
2714,And it's nice~ when in the backcountry~ to be able to type out a text to my wife right from the phone and send it via the Inreach system,1
2715,I have the $11 per month subscription and find it to be more than adequate,1
2716,Inreach mini saved me from paying for a helicopter rescue in the alps this year~ was overdue and my roommate got concerned so he went and contacted the mountain rescue folks but eventually I was able to get in touch with him and tell him while I'm an idiot I am in fact safe,1
2717,I tend to use my inreach about once every 1.5 months~ generally to tell someone hey I'm not going to be home tonight but I am okay,1
2718,The $11 a month kills it for piece of mind,1
2719,I wouldn't want the bigger inreach because as others have said their mapping abilities are meh compared to a phone~ but it certainly has given me piece of mind both in the moments where I knew I was okay but people may be worrying about me~ and the fewer moments where I wasn't sure if everything was going to be okay.,1
2720,Thanks everyone I think im persuaded to go with the mini!,1
2721,I recently was on a backpacking trip where we went 18 miles in to the base of the blue glacier at the base of mount Olympus in Washington,1
2722,As we set up camp my buddies wife texted me via in-reach that her dad just had a massive heart attack,1
2723,We bailed out the next morning and am NEVER going without an in reach again,1
2724,Even on day hikes that thing is on and tracking and someone knows how to track me and my plans,1
2725,It’s 2019 and there is no reason to be out without something in my opinion,1
2726,Not at least for me,1
2727,I understand the soloist mentality but if I don’t return home after a trip~ the entire trip was a failure,1
2728,Summit or not my life is more important and so is my entire team,1
2729,For anyone else looking for a device don't overlook the Somewear Labs device,1
2730,It's a super simple locator device that pairs with your phone that allows you to text,1
2731,The device by itself has an SOS function but you need a phone for texting,1
2732,I have had the Spot and InReach,1
2733,The InReach has more bells and whistles but the Somewear is cheaper and has been more reliable than the InReach,1
2734,My InReach was spotty in the sense of getting messages out~ it didn't have to do with signal it turned out to be more software related,1
2735,Anyway the Somwear Labs device has been great and is worth a consideration.,1
2736,Love the mini,1
2737,huge fan,1
2738,Been wanting to buy one~ and then I saw all these reviews about quality control issues,1
2739,I see they've updated it this year and I'm wondering if anyone has tried out the latest version? I know they switched the insulation too,1
2740,Thanks for reading!,1
2741,Just got the new version yesterday~ just called the “Belay parka”  It’s a nice coat but i think i’m going to send it back,1
2742,it’s too heavy and too bulky for me,1
2743,But i do long distance stuff and weight/pack space is important to me,1
2744,As far as the warmth it’s toasty,1
2745,the insulation in it is dense and not “puffy” like down,1
2746,it packs down to a small sleeping bag and is 12oz heavier than my Pat hyper puff,1
2747,It’s a Slick looking parka though~ HUGE hood and covers your ass,1
2748,hope this helps,1
2749,Any La Sportiva Testarossa devotees out there try out the redesign?  If so~ do you like it?  Sizing the same? How's the new heel? Thanks.,1
2750,I haven’t climbed in them yet~ but I have tried them on~ and I was very happy with how they felt,1
2751,I have been wearing testarossas forever~ and was very apprehensive about the change~ but now I’m cautiously optimistic,1
2752,I tried the same size as my old ones~ and they felt right,1
2753,The biggest difference is the heel~ it is much stiffer now~ but it also felt smaller~ somewhat less incut on the Achilles’ tendon~ and for me this was a good thing,1
2754,My current pair of old-style testarossas is only two months old~ so I probably won’t be buying a new pair until the fall,1
2755,Maybe by then I’ll get to try them on a shoe demo~ there is usually one at the rocktoberfest~ so dear La Sportiva rep~ if you are reading this~ please have a pair in size 36? Please? ;),1
2756,They are my favorite shoe~ but I’ve never been crazy about the squishy heal,1
2757,The new version made the shoe complete~ imo,1
2758,However~ if you liked the old heal~ it may not be an improvement for you,1
2759,Sizing-wise I found it to be the same~ maybe a tad tad tad bigger (Less than 1/4 size),1
2760,I wouldn’t size any differently,1
2761,The new heal is very similar to the Genius,1
2762,Great shoe that got even better~ go get’em!,1
2763,Just spotted this: https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNtKNOn2C4/ La Sportiva saying to downsize a half size further from your old Testarossa size,1
2764,Ugh,1
2765,Why oh why do they insist in changing what was already great??  I actually love the heel the way it is.,1
2766,Just try it~ I was saying the same thing~ the old heel was just fine! I expected to dislike the new heel~ but didn’t.,1
2767," Bought a pair simply to try them on and see how they compared~ side by side~ to a brand new pair of ""old"" Testarossas~ and low and behold~ they are very different",1
2768,The new ones fit about a quarter size larger~ which sort of f****s me over because a half size smaller will be impossible to get into~ and excruciating even if I can get into them~ and the current size is just slightly too big,1
2769,Also~ the new heel is exactly like the Genius~ which I think sucks,1
2770,F*** YOU~ LA SPORTIVA! Guess I'll be stocking up on old pairs anywhere I can find them,1
2771,Weird~ it felt different than Genius heel to me..,1
2772,I   anyway~ good luck finding the old ones,1
2773,Hopefully you are one of those less-in-demand sizes,1
2774,2 months ago GearExpress was the only online source that had my size,1
2775,Weirdly enough~ they seem to be the only retailers that haven’t discounted old model of testarossas..,1
2776,they still list them for $180...,1
2777,Luckily there are a few pairs of the old version floating around the net in my size (43.5) ~ no deep discount~ though~ which is a bummer,1
2778,Have you ever resoled a pair?  I never have,1
2779,Perhaps I will have to now,1
2780,If so~ how have they taken to one?,1
2781,I've had a couple pair of old version Testarossas resoled,1
2782,They're a very soft shoe~ sensitive~ so you have to send them in very early~ pretty much as soon as the rand peaks down the sole line -- otherwise I doubt you'll be happy with their future performance.,1
2783,I have resoled  my very first pair of testarossas~ and was disappointed,1
2784,I felt that the shoe completely changed shape~ even though I did send it to a resoler recommended by la Sportiva,1
2785,I have not bothered resoling since then,1
2786,But that was 10 years ago~ things may have changed since then,1
2787,Just bought a pair of the new ones~ in the same size as the red-and-yellows,1
2788,I stocked up on the old ones because I was paranoid about the redesign~ but I think that was unnecessary,1
2789,It seems to fit the same in the forefoot,1
2790,The heel is more snug~ which I like,1
2791,I'll have to spend some time using them to know if the heel performance is better or not~ since I liked the old one just fine,1
2792,To the resole question~ my one resoled pair is 95% as good as a new pair,1
2793,They did stiffen up just slightly~ in a way that doesn't hurt performance but does hurt comfort.,1
2794,2 full resoles on my old testarossas from rock and resole,1
2795,Downturn and fit are like new,1
2796,They still had a good bump up under the big toe on the resole? I've got 4 pairs of the old style stock piled~ but eventually they'll wear out,1
2797,I love the original since I have bone spurs (haglunds deformity) that get painful pressure from stiff heel cups.,1
2798,REI still has some old model for sale in smaller sizes,1
2799,After wearing my black/red pair for a day~ I feel like they might be a bit bigger than the red/yellow,1
2800,They definitely have less-pronounced heel tension,1
2801,I'm not unhappy with them at all but next time I need a new pair I'll at least try a half size smaller.,1
2802,I can confirm~ after trying both 43.5 and 43 (my size in the old Testarossa is 43.5) that they run approximately 1/4-1/2 size bigger,1
2803,Closer to 1/4 size~ with my foot,1
2804,Will be buying 43's in the new version~ and they'll definitely be more painful,1
2805,Oh well,1
2806,Weird~ it felt different than Genius heel to me..,1
2807,I   anyway~ good luck finding the old ones,1
2808,Hopefully you are one of those less-in-demand sizes,1
2809,2 months ago GearExpress was the only online source that had my size,1
2810,Weirdly enough~ they seem to be the only retailers that haven’t discounted old model of testarossas..,1
2811,they still list them for $180..,1
2812,You can compare prices on the old model here! https://www.footbeta.com/s/ls_tes_o/,1
2813,You can compare prices on the old model here! https://www.footbeta.com/s/ls_tes_o/ What do you think is the advantage of your website~ over the same thing that google search gets me?,1
2814,What do you think is the advantage of your website~ over the same thing that google search gets me? True- having size information would be super handy..,1
2815,Something to add for the future,1
2816,Thank you for your feedback!,1
2817,Relatively good price on the new model ($141.47 shipped) from this German retailer on Ebayhttps://ebay.to/2Qt6ZS2,1
2818,This is the new version,1
2819,We’re looking for the old version,1
2820,Sheesh~ I don’t know what you’re looking for~ just thought I’d share a good deal on the 2019 Testarossa in a thread called “2019 La Sportiva Testarossa”.,1
2821,Thanks,1
2822,Maybe read some of the thread to see what it’s about before just posting something?,1
2823,I did read it and saw a few people saying they enjoyed the new one and saw you saying you were gonna buy a size 43 in the new style,1
2824,In fact~ I have been following the thread since you started it since I was curious about the new model also,1
2825,Sorry if my post disrupted the flow of your thread,1
2826,Still better than 75% of the nonsense posted in the “great online deals thread” imo,1
2827,I got the new style Testarossa half size smaller than the original per La Sportiva’s Instagram post and they are indeed more painful but I still like em.,1
2828,Weird~ it felt different than Genius heel to me..,1
2829,I   anyway~ good luck finding the old ones,1
2830,Hopefully you are one of those less-in-demand sizes,1
2831,2 months ago GearExpress was the only online source that had my size,1
2832,Weirdly enough~ they seem to be the only retailers that haven’t discounted old model of testarossas..,1
2833,they still list them for $180..,1
2834,I agree about the heel,1
2835,I found the Genius very difficult to fit as compared to the new ones on the testerossa,1
2836,Have used mine now for 3 weeks .about twice a week.They do seem a bit bigger and sometime I might try to down size,1
2837,For now they feel fabulous with any real extra space on my left heel...just a tiny bit.The toe box seems perfect though.,1
2838,I agree about the heel,1
2839,I found the Genius very difficult to fit as compared to the new ones on the testerossa,1
2840,Have used mine now for 3 weeks .about twice a week.They do seem a bit bigger and sometime I might try to down size,1
2841,For now they feel fabulous with any real extra space on my left heel...just a tiny bit.The toe box seems perfect though,1
2842,Do you think the forefoot is remains same between half sizes or goes smaller? I am debating about going half a size down as is being recommended~ but my issue has always been a wider forefoot,1
2843,I wear 40s in the old model~ and the heel is already a bit loose,1
2844,Based on what's being said I'm afraid going 40 in the new model will leave way too much space in the heel and going 39.5 will leave me with too little in front,1
2845,Do you think the forefoot is remains same between half sizes or goes smaller? I am debating about going half a size down as is being recommended~ but my issue has always been a wider forefoot,1
2846,I wear 40s in the old model~ and the heel is already a bit loose,1
2847,Based on what's being said I'm afraid going 40 in the new model will leave way too much space in the heel and going 39.5 will leave me with too little in front,1
2848,I tried the size down in the store here in London,1
2849,Would concur with others IE they run bigger now I wore 36.5 in the old originals these I would guess would be equal to the 36 in the new version.I bought these in 36.5 and have used them quite a lot,1
2850,They seem great.I have a narrow forefoot but medium/wide middle and narrow heel..Up sizing works but downsizing in the new sizing does as well.,1
2851,Thanks David,1
2852,Okay~ since consensus seems to be that they are about half a size larger than the old version~ I went ahead and ordered a 39.5,1
2853,Wish I could try them on first~ but they aren't available in the country I'm in at the moment but also got a pair of the old ones in my normal size as insurance.,1
2854,Hello!  Did anyone downsize a 1/2 size (EU) and find they were still too long? I wear a 41.5 in the original and they fit perfectly~ but a 41 in the new model is definitely too long for my feet,1
2855,"From the sportiva instagram post referenced earlier in the thread they suggested an ""extra 1/2 size"" which would seem to imply downsizing 2 half-sizes~ given the use of ""extra""",1
2856,However~ after reading this thread a 1/2 size smaller was what a few people said fit best,1
2857,I didn't want to risk going down too small as I ordered them online and also wanted a slightly bigger pair for long days outdoors - so worst case scenario I have that bigger pair,1
2858,Which is the case,1
2859,Now to find the size that would match the fit of the originals,1
2860,If anyone has a 40~ 40.5~ and/or 41 and can measure them in centimetres that would be most helpful,1
2861,Highly unlikely my 41s were mislabled as a 41 but a length comparison would be great,1
2862,Also~ anyone notice that they seem ever so slightly less downturned? unless the added length creates an optical illusion lol,1
2863,thanks!,1
2864,I interpreted the IG post as going down .5 EU size from your old model size,1
2865,Since I wore a 41 in old model~ I bought the new model in 41 and 40.5 to try out,1
2866,Comparing the two new models both visually and by fit~ 40.5 is shorter,1
2867,My experience: New model 41 was a bit loose/long straight out of the box,1
2868,40.5 started off tight~ but has broken in,1
2869,It is tighter than my old model 41 still~ but nothing crazy,1
2870,The heel is much better/more snug,1
2871,I agree~ the new model does look less downturned.,1
2872,I would agree with everything here in terms of sizing,1
2873,I wear a 43.5 in the old version and a 43 in the new version,1
2874,It’s certainly tighter than the old 43.5~ but not to the same degree that an old 43 would’ve been,1
2875,I still prefer the old heel~ the old colors~ and the old sizing~ but I guess this is what we’re stuck with,1
2876,I think the stiffness of the heel makes the shoe appear less downturned~ whereas before it just flopped down,1
2877,If anyone on this thread is still looking for old Testarossas (size 41)~ I'm selling some,1
2878,See link below.https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/117521465/fs-testarossa-size-41,1
2879,Still looking for 43.5~ if anyone has em!,1
2880,I picked up the 40.5 and they fit a wee bit tighter (on my left foot) than my 41.5 OGs when new~ but feel like they're close to becoming a perfect fit after a few routes indoors,1
2881,I think?!?!  Right foot feels perfect'ish; left foot soso'ish,1
2882,They're still in that kind-of too painful/too stiff break-in period so fingers crossed they fit even better than the OGs after a week of climbing,1
2883,Thankfully~ the 41s (new model) are great for outdoors when my feet swell up and the 41.5 OGs become too tight for my sore toes.,1
2884," I read it as you did at first (and in relation to this thread) but they didn't say go down a .5 EU size~ they said an ""extra .5 size"" which could have been a colloquialism but if you care to indulge my nerdiness for a moment~ no need to say extra imo lol - either way~ the 41s turned out to be a worthwhile buy as they come through outdoors when needed",1
2885,I love the OGs but the wee bit tighter feel of the NMs may prove to be a winner after they've broken in,1
2886,Good luck to every ones feet! And that can be said when purchasing: indoor vs outdoor use,1
2887,I can climb all day indoors and there's not much change to how my shoes feel,1
2888,Outdoors and the OGs can become too painful to wear,1
2889,I agree about the heel,1
2890,I found the Genius very difficult to fit as compared to the new ones on the testerossa,1
2891,Have used mine now for 3 weeks .about twice a week.They do seem a bit bigger and sometime I might try to down size,1
2892,For now they feel fabulous with any real extra space on my left heel...just a tiny bit.The toe box seems perfect though,1
2893,Thanks,1
2894,Maybe read some of the thread to see what it’s about before just posting something? Just cause you’re on the internet doesn’t mean you have to be a jerk.,1
2895,I got the same size as my old pair and honestly they don’t feel any different~ maybe a bit longer to break in,1
2896,How do you size testarossas compared to katana laces? My street shoe size is US 13; I wear 45.5 in katana laces...,1
2897,Ive got a brand new pair (old version) with tags still on in 41.5 if anyones interested,1
2898,$110 shipped,1
2899,How do your Katana Laces fit? If they are comfy(ish)~ all-day type fit then these reference points might be less useful~ but here they are anyways...,1
2900,But this video is,1
2901,Hey guys~ So I'm looking to get into some serious mountaineering after doing some fun alpine hiking in NZ a few weeks ago,1
2902,I'm an experienced climber and do all sorts of other activities (canyoning~ caving etc) but this NZ trip was my first taste of actual mountains and I just want more...​https://testmyspeed.onl/​​​ A guided tour would be a fantastic intro~ such as from NZAC however they 1) don't run in winter 2) are expensive (even though i'm aware that they’re the cheapest option - I’m a student alright haha),1
2903,This leads me onto my main question: what do I need to do to meet the people that could teach m e the skills necessary to navigate the mountains? I’m willing to be the pack horse of a group just to get into the mountains and learn… ​https://xender.vip/​​​ I have a month off from June-July so I plan on spending as much as that time in the NZ alpine gaining experience and alpine knowledge,1
2904,I’ve been reading books (mountaineering: freedom of the hills~ Training for the new alpinism) however nothing beats 101 face time with an experienced person to tell you what you missed~ what you’re doing wrong~ how to improve… I can use crampons and self arrest~ do anything climbing related rope work etc~ however I specifically lack snow/glacier travel knowledge and anything that’s mountaineering specific..,1
2905,I love hiking and climbing (most notably solo)~ the adventure~ pure hardship and independence; I want to push myself this winter and climb some bloody amazing mountains! However~ I also don't love dying so I’d love to hear all of your advice on how I can achieve these short term goals over the coming months! If you have literally any sort of advice you’d like to share~ I'd love to hear it; Cheers!https://19216811.cam/,1
2906,If you are in New Zealand~ just join a climbing/tramping (aka hiking) club,1
2907,They tend to run regular trips~ with a lot of people developing their skills there,1
2908,Many even run their own intro to snow courses over the winter,1
2909,Try either the NZAC~ CMC~ the university tramping/climbing clubs~ or your local tramping club,1
2910,Harder tramping in NZ blends into easy mountaineering~ and there's a fair amount of overlap in outdoor skills.,1
2911,Where are you based? It matters a lot how easily you can access the mountains...,1
2912,When looking at MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna~ they both look very similar,1
2913,Yes~ you enter the end from different side~ but overall structure is similar,1
2914,Is it safe to assume that both tents would perform the same as a 4-season tent?,1
2915,One is a 3 pound single wall tent and the other is a 5 pound double wall~ so pretty different in those ways,1
2916,I have the Unna and like it~ but actually would prefer the Advance pro for most of my climbing goals,1
2917,I think the Unna is better for base camp style whereas the AP2 I'm guessing would be better for alpine style pushes where you're carrying your tent up routes,1
2918,Thanks for the reply,1
2919,One last question,1
2920,What is your opinion about choosing Unna or Advance Pro for Denali West Buttress expedition?  Also~ how would you compare Hilleberg Soulo and Advance Pro?  Soulo has three poles~ where Advance Pro only two,1
2921,Do you feel strength of the Advance would be enough for the wether conditions on Denali?,1
2922,I would recommend neither tent for a Denali trip as they are very small and not very enjoyable for waiting out storms,1
2923,I hope you aren't planning on climbing Denali solo as the lower Kahiltna glacier is very heavily crevassed.,1
2924,It's not a solo West Buttress Expedition~ I'm just solo in a tent,1
2925,I have three tents/options: Option 1:https://www.msrgear.com/tents/all-season-tents/advance-pro-2-ultralight-2-person-4-season-tent/13110.html Option 2:https://hilleberg.com/eng/tent/red-label-tents/soulo/ Option 3:  https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/82300156/katabatic-2-tent?sp=1&color=Limeade&size=ONE%20SIZE Advance and Soulo are both light and strong and since I will be solo in a tent only~ I feel that one of those will work.,1
2926,If you're intent on using one of those three~ I would get the Unna and upgrade to 10mm poles,1
2927,It's roomier then the Soulo,1
2928,The single wall MSR would be silly,1
2929,Jdejace~,1
2930,Same answer as for the Direkt when you asked last year.,1
2931,How do they compare to Dragonflies and Totems?,1
2932,They are very similar to dragonflies,1
2933,They are not yet totems because the 2 sides of lobes arent independently loaded like the totem,1
2934,I’d say biggest benefit of Z4’s are weight~ grip power (from the soft metal on the lobes)~ and #1 benefit is that they won’t walk as much as the cams they replace,1
2935,They also have the G-factor and look cool,1
2936,I've never placed DMM dragonflies~ but I've worked extensively with X4s and Alien Revolutions,1
2937,I now own a set of the Z4s and have placed them a few dozen times,1
2938,I am all in with the Z4s for several reasons~ although the Aliens are a close second,1
2939,The Black Diamond Z4s are much lighter than X4s and Dragonflies,1
2940,Aliens are slightly lighter~ but the difference is negligible,1
2941,However~ you get greater durability with the Z4s over the aliens~ and you also get the double axel down to 0.3,1
2942,DMM dragonflies have a smaller range than both Z4s~ X4s~ and Aliens,1
2943,Aliens have the greatest range of them all~ but BD microcams are close,1
2944,The Z4s have the new trigger system that stiffens up the cam while placing and loosens up when released to provide greater holding power for horizontal placements and for reducing walk potential,1
2945,This actually works and the difference is noticeable,1
2946,The Z4s have pretty solid construction,1
2947,The lobes are softer than the X4s~ which provides greater grip in placements,1
2948,The aliens have even softer aluminum~ but to a fault; alien cams become deformed easily,1
2949,I've heard people are having problems with the springs and trigger action with their DMMs,1
2950,Although I haven't used my Z4s for very long~ I believe this won't be an issue,1
2951,The plastic around the trigger of the Z4s seems solid and ample in providing protection to the stem/trigger system,1
2952,The Z4s have a single sling,1
2953,This is largely preference~ but I prefer the simplicity and don't like fumbling with a double sling,1
2954,It doesn't seem to reduce the need for alpine draws,1
2955,Lastly~ the Z4s are cheaper than the dragonflies~ X4s~ and Aliens,1
2956,For now~ I think it is the best microcam on the market,1
2957,But we'll have to wait and see what Wild Country comes up with,1
2958,Totems are a whole other animal,1
2959,They are expensive~ heavy~ awkward~ and more difficult to clean,1
2960,However~ friends swear by them,1
2961,The independent loading can remove the need for offsets~ but I  don't know if the holding power is better than a well placed offset,1
2962,And for parallel placements~ I'm just not sure the holding power is much better than any other microcam to justify the cons,1
2963,Disclaimer: I haven't fallen on a Z4 yet,1
2964,Maybe the cam will reveal its faults after I do,1
2965,Listening to you let's us believe the Totem is the deepest shitty cam while it's the best,1
2966,I just got the smallest one~ it’s more in line with a C3 in head-width and is small,1
2967,Getting that inject the pro in the crack ninja feeling y’alls.,1
2968,Every other cam seems to run 25% off deals on independent websites~ making the totem roughly $40 more,1
2969,Either way~ its $20 more than a Z4,1
2970,C3,1
2971,RIP,1
2972,Every other cam seems to run 25% off deals on independent websites~ making the totem roughly $40 more,1
2973,Either way~ its $20 more than a Z4,1
2974,This person obviously doesnt use Totems,1
2975,All of the negatives he's stated are untrue,1
2976,They arent awkward~ they're ABSOLUTELY the easiest cam to clean becasue of their lobe shape~ and they're one of the few cams that can be placed easily with winter gloves on,1
2977,Opinions are opinions~ but this is an odd takeaway to have~ and is the exact opposite of everything I think about them.,1
2978,Hey everyone! A buddy and I split 200m of static rope and cut it in half,1
2979,I’m wanting to make a mark in the middle of the rope but am not sure what the best way to go about it would be? The rope is black so most of the solutions I’ve seen online won’t work as well as I would hope,1
2980,I’ve seen tape and buying specialty markers as to not damage the rope,1
2981,The tape idea could work for a short time but It will eventually come undone as it moves through metal and across Rock,1
2982,And I’m sure we wouldn’t be able to see the dye.Has anyone done anything that has worked well for them? Open to all ideas,1
2983,With that being said I also have a rope that has been used pretty much exclusively for top rope and the middle marks have become faded,1
2984,I was going to mark it with a dye or specialty marker but also wanted to know if anyone has done anything that worked really well for them,1
2985,I’m assuming marking dynamic and static would be different,1
2986,Please let me know! Thank you all!,1
2987,Sharpie,1
2988,I use Beal's rope marker and it works well,1
2989,For the black rope~ sew some white dental floss into the sheath at the middle.,1
2990,Whipping with dental floss~ nylon twine~ or that red/white cotton twine from an Italian bakery,1
2991,Or white tape of your choice.,1
2992,TL~DR I’d describe the Acopa Spectres as well-balanced,1
2993,Edge well~ smear well~ heel hook well,1
2994,Quickest break in of any shoe I’ve had~ and immediately comfortable,1
2995,I love the aesthetics and build quality.,1
2996,Quick update I’ve now climbed 18 pitches in the shoes~ from 10d-13b~ all around vertical sport climbing,1
2997,The combination of edging and sensitivity is holding true~ they have broken in nicely without excess stretch,1
2998,A lot of my sport climbs in the Upper Gorge have had foot jams~ or rand smears in corners~ and they excel in that role,1
2999,The rubber has great friction~ I’m still adapting to it~ I think it’s probably more similar to Vibram Grip than Vibram Edge (which I use more) on the softness/firmness spectrum,1
3000,At some point I’ll get some photos out on the rock but my time has been a little tight,1
3001,Anyone else try these?,1
3002,Great cross between Edge and Grip,1
3003,Not quite as hard as Edge rubber with all of the grip if XS Grip,1
3004,Sounds about right to me Layne,1
3005,I keep comparing them to my long term favorite Katana Laces~ I left the Spectres at home and used my newly resolved Katanas yesterday and I felt like they weren’t quite as good as I remembered,1
3006,Maybe it’s the 2nd or 3rd resole and the liners being worn but the Spectres seemed more sensitive but also weren’t slowly slipping off of holds,1
3007,I've been using BD's positron screw lockers for a while and can't find them anymore,1
3008,Are they discontinued? If so~ what's the new version that's replacing it? Thanks,1
3009,They were discontinued and have been replaced with the hotforge lockers,1
3010,They moved most of their carabiner production to the world's largest carabiner factory based out of Taiwan,1
3011,CIC~ I believe,1
3012,Literally every carabiner manufacturer makes a small modified D screw gate locker,1
3013,Find one you like and buy it,1
3014,I'm sure BD still makes something just like it.,1
3015,Time to find a new favorite? These are slick: CAMP Photon Locker,1
3016,I have been wandering in the mountains for several years now and I have been evolving my mountaineering skills step by step,1
3017,From simple hiking to rock climbing~ alpine climbing up to demanding mix climbing techniques.See full review with many photos here:https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2020/02/17/cassin-alpinist-tech-crampon-first-thoughts-review/ While evolving and acquiring new knowledge~ it has been necessary to update my mountaineering gear too,1
3018,My first pair of crampons were the Rock Empire Mackhi~ and my second pair the Grivel G12,1
3019,While my general mountaineering skills got more advanced~ I felt the need to update my crampons too,1
3020,The Grivel G12 are exceptional~ though I was feeling that the G12 were limiting me on the mixed climbing and Dry Tooling fields.,1
3021,I recently got all my cams re-slung and wanted to write a review of the process as I had never done it before and had a lot of questions,1
3022,I used three different companies to re-sling: Metolius for Metolius cams~ Black Diamond for Black Diamond cams~ and Mountain Tools for miscellaneous cams (aliens~ dmm~ omega-pacific),1
3023,1.Metolius # of Cams: 8 Length of service: few weeks Recommend? Definitely,1
3024,Review: Awesome service! Also the cheapest--$3/re-sling plus they inspect and lube your cams as well!   2.Black Diamond # of Cams: 34 Length of service: 1 month Recommend? No,1
3025,Review: The quality of the work was of course~ great,1
3026,However~ they ran out of blue slings and chose to mail my package back (all re-slung cams + blue cams w/o slings) first~ and then they sent an email to notify me,1
3027,Had they called to explain or even waited for communication via email~ I would have opted for another color sling,1
3028,The color doesn’t matter—I just want operational cams especially because I had cut the slings off originally before mailing,1
3029,Mailing my seven blue cams back to me with nothing done to them was a waste of time and money,1
3030,Shipping is expensive,1
3031,#3s are heavy,1
3032,And now I can't even climb on them,1
3033,They said they will be out of blue slings for another 3-4 months,1
3034,3.Mountain Tools # of Cams: 13 + 2 tricams Length of service: 1 month Recommend? Yes,1
3035,Review: The quality of the work was great and Larry and Jane kept me up-to-date on the service via email,1
3036,My only complaint--their online ordering system was outdated and not user-friendly,1
3037,Wicked neat post~ I appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences,1
3038,I’ll be sending some pieces in for new slings soon and this will certainly be some useful info (some of my slings are blue!),1
3039,Thanks.,1
3040,Which DMM cams did you resling with Mountain Tools? Wondering if the Dragon 2s are reslingable through mountain tools instead of shipping to the UK,1
3041,Yes they are~ I think Mtn Tools is the only DMM certified reslinger in the US,1
3042," Triggered response moved to ""pet peeves"" or ""what do you hate about older climbers"" Just said that  I  don't get what makes you all think that you need to replace good webbing with new webbing ?  If its a modification to add redundant extendability sure but you almost certainly did not wear out the existing webbing & the durability of what you replaced it with might be less that~ of the stuff you cut off for no good reason(s)",1
3043,i have old slings on all my cams,1
3044,i keep my gear in pretty damn good condition too,1
3045,lucky for me~ when i do think a sling needs to be replaced~ i can just head out to my shop and bar tack a new one on myself,1
3046,whole process takes 5 minutes~ including cutting a piece of sling and melting the ends~ and putting 5 or 6 bar tacks on it,1
3047,simple to do and i still very rarely replace any,1
3048,people are being conditioned to think sling replacement is neededwhen its just not,1
3049,someone came up with an industry safety standard for manufacturers of climbing gear to cover their asses,1
3050,on the other hand~ the manufacturers do replace slings for a paltry sum~ so if it makes you feel better and you can do without your gear for a month and dont mind paying the shipping too~ and youre anal~ then go for it...,1
3051,im going to send that ryan jenks dude some 30 year old well used well taken care of slings and see what happens.,1
3052,I'll add my experience,1
3053,BD contacted me before I sent in my cams about being out of blue nylon~ so I canceled my order and sent my camalots to Runout Customs,1
3054,Luke did a great job with quick turn around (10 days?),1
3055,Metolius is the way to go for their cams,1
3056,Regarding not needing to replace webbing:  You're probably right~ but I do it anyways,1
3057," The cost is relatively cheap~ and the corresponding ""cost"" of failure could be high",1
3058,I put bike helmets in the same category as nylon climbing gear,1
3059,The cost of a brain injury from a possible failure of an old helmet is not worth the $100 bucks or whatever every couple of years for a new mtb helmet,1
3060,Regarding replacing old gear with new lighter gear: I'm getting older and lighter gear keeps me in the game (or~ at least makes the game more fun),1
3061,That said~ I try to balance gear longevity/durability with weight savings,1
3062,What kind of bartacker did you go with?,1
3063,What kind of bartacker did you go with? picked up a juki on the cheap from a sewing machine place in upstate ny when i went to get a 308 machine i bought off ebay,1
3064,I personally change the dogbone/sling on sport draws (they do see more abrasion~ generally~ at least in my experience)~ but I haven't reslung cams,1
3065,As far as I have seen~ nylon doesn't degrade due to time alone in a significant way (exposure to UV or element may be different),1
3066,Therefore my personal criteria is just inspection & replacement on visible wear,1
3067,If the question at large does interest you~ there's a few topics on MP on that subject with links to various tests & studies on older material,1
3068,It's interesting reading/viewing.,1
3069,Mountain Tools (Larry and Jane) are great,1
3070,Used them a few times and am very satisfied.,1
3071,My choices these days are Metolius for Metolius cams and Luke at Runout Customs for everything else,1
3072,He did 25 cams for me~ and the work is top notch.,1
3073,I can't speak to Mountain Tools~ but Luke at Runout Customs did a superb job on my C4's~ aliens~ and Metolius cams,1
3074,Will be sending him my Friends one of these days soon!,1
3075,Another vouch for Runout..,1
3076,Luke did my cams when he (and I) lived around Moab,1
3077,Top notch work; quickly done,1
3078,Thanks again~ Luke!,1
3079,I had BD resling my cams a year ago and they were out of blue,1
3080,"I guess they most frequently run out of that color because that's the first ""double color"" (.3 and 3) that people get when building their rack.",1
3081,I had an amazing experience with Metolius too - I really like that they add a new date tab to the webbing letting me know when I should probably get them reslung next,1
3082,Anyone  had a chance to try out these new  Scarpa boots? Comments?,1
3083,I can only comment on fit as I did not pull the trigger on them: I have a wide-ish forefoot~ regular heel~ and low arch,1
3084,I felt that for me~ the new phantom tech was too loose in the heel~ little too low volume in the forefoot~ and a bit less wide toebox than what you would expect from Scarpa,1
3085,I have not been able to compare with the previous PT model (trying to score a couple discounted pairs to try on as they are no longer in stores around me)~ but I can compare with the old Mont Blanc GTX (not Pro) and La Sportiva's line of ice boots,1
3086,The Mont Blanc GTX was a pretty great fit for me~ I was expecting something similar from these but was let down,1
3087,Most Scarpa rock shoes also fit me well,1
3088,Compared to the average la sportiva fit~ the new PT feels just a tad wider but fairly similar in volume and little sloppier in the heel,1
3089,From what little reviews there are online~ I saw a few agreeing sentiments on fit - but hey YMMV~ I may just have a weird or hypersentive foot,1
3090,They feel super light though~ and I was looking forward to these because of the more durable sole and normal lacing/zipper~ but I'm still on the hunt.,1
3091,I just got it,1
3092,I was using Nepal Cubes before~ except my left heel got murdered on approaches~ despite any adjustments I made,1
3093,Unfortunately~ my heel is still messed up~ so in trying on different boots~ the new phantom tech was the one in which my left heel hurt the least,1
3094,Compared to a nepal cube or a Trango Ice cube~ these walk much easier and climb the same~ for me,1
3095,Also~ I had to wear a 44 in Trango ice cubes~ 43 in Nepal cubes~ and settled on a 42.5 in the PT,1
3096,Boot fit is highly personal...sad that there aren’t more shops that carry a wider selection than the usual basic Scarpa/Sportiva latest offerings.,1
3097,For reference~ I usually rock the scarpa Mont Blanc Pros and have had a pretty good fit with those,1
3098,I ordered the newest phantom techs thinking it should fit the same but the fit changed,1
3099,For me the heel is way too loose,1
3100,I tried a variety of solutions but nothing worked for me,1
3101,Other than that the boot is fantastic,1
3102,It's warm~ it's light~ it walks incredibly well~ and for me the toe box is the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a mountaineering boot,1
3103,Unfortunately for me~ I just can't get past the heel lift.,1
3104,I got to try the new MBPs and the last gen Phantom techs to update my comparison,1
3105,I agree the MBP heel fit is nice; glove-like compared to some other boots,1
3106,Not at all like what i remember of the new phantom techs,1
3107,The lower volume toebox was a no-go for me though,1
3108,Last gen phantom techs were a middle of the road heel-fit between the new phantom techs and the MBPs~ the toe box was adequately roomier than both,1
3109,Anyone out there used Greater Tahoe Gripworks to resole their soft/sensitive shoes like Testarossas~ Dragos~ or No-Edge shoes? Their photos look amazing~ using “official” La Sportiva cutouts,1
3110,The real question is: how do they perform? Thanks!,1
3111,They killed it on my shoes,1
3112,Warning~ he emailed me a month or two ago that he had an injured hand and it would take an extra week or two to finish the shoes,1
3113,No biggie for me,1
3114,Still did good work,1
3115,I highly recommend Greater Tahoe Gripworks~ Chris does awesome work,1
3116,He resoled my Scarpa Instincts and they've held up great through hundreds of pitches and many bouldering sessions.,1
3117,He does great work~ turnaround time is quick~ no complaints at all.,1
3118,Hi Brendan,1
3119,Not sure if you’re still considering sending your shoes in~ but please make note~ our shop is moving to a new location during the month of September so turnaround time is longer than normal,1
3120,We do repair all styles of shoes and have a lot of experience with all the shoes you mentioned,1
3121,Please give us a chance! Thanks - Chris,1
3122,I'm trying you out Chris,1
3123,Four pairs should be at the P.O,1
3124,Box in two-three days,1
3125,Any chance of having them back in MN by 8-30? ...not super critical,1
3126,I highly recommend Chris at Tahoe Gripworks~ as well!  Great dude that does great work!  I have sent him about a dozen pairs of shoes to date.,1
3127,Thanks for responding!  Do you use still use La Sportiva factory cutouts~ as in your social media photos~ for resoles~ for shoes like the Testarossa and Genius?  I definitely plan to check you guys out when I need a resole.,1
3128,HI Kyle,1
3129,I just received your shoes in the mail today,1
3130,Thanks a lot for your order! There's a good chance they'll be to you by the 30th,1
3131,I'll do my best and will keep you posted.,1
3132,Thanks for responding!  Do you use still use La Sportiva factory cutouts~ as in your social media photos~ for resoles~ for shoes like the Testarossa and Genius?  I definitely plan to check you guys out when I need a resole,1
3133,Brendan~ I currently have the original cutouts for the Genius/Futura/Speedster/Maverink~ but not the Testarossa - at the moment,1
3134,I have templates for all the soles however and can use either Vibram or Stealth on the Testarossas~ so you can ensure that you'll get a properly formed sole replacement,1
3135,You're moving? Where to? I am on the Tahoe North Shore and was thinking of dropping some pairs off on the way to Mammoth this weekend.,1
3136,Hi Ryan~ the shop will be closed all September for the move and renovations - so there is currently no where to drop off up there,1
3137,You could ship the shoes to my current PO box though,1
3138,Just know that they will not be worked on until the first week of Oct.~ but they will be first in line if you get them to me soon.,1
3139,Hi Ryan~ the shop will be closed all September for the move and renovations - so there is currently no where to drop off up there,1
3140,You could ship the shoes to my current PO box though,1
3141,Just know that they will not be worked on until the first week of Oct.~ but they will be first in line if you get them to me soon,1
3142,Shredmands~,1
3143,Shredmands~,1
3144,Yep! Still opening first week of October,1
3145,Please feel free to text my cell~ or call~ if you have any orher questions,1
3146,530-307-0046,1
3147,Thanks!,1
3148,Greater Tahoe Gripworks is my favorite resole company,1
3149,I have sent shoes to the rubber room~ a shop in the NW and GTGW,1
3150,I resoled a pair of shamans and 5.10 blancos with Gripworks,1
3151,The shoes are crisp and new and show no signs of defects,1
3152,Send your shoes to Chris! He will return a quality product,1
3153,Take the chance!!!,1
3154,Chris does really quality work!  I highly recommend using their service over at Greater Tahoe Gripworks~ especially if you have any No Edge shoes you need resoled,1
3155,Thanks for the kind words Taylor!,1
3156,Thanks a ton for the support tbol! I really appreciate the recommendation,1
3157,Just had a pair of TC Pros resoled by Chris,1
3158,I got them back within a week of sending them out~ and they look better than when they were new,1
3159,Highly~ highly recommend!,1
3160,Sent a pair of shoes in a year or two ago,1
3161,Nice resole,1
3162,Took over a month,1
3163,My only complaint: I had requested XS Edge,1
3164,After charging my credit card~ and having my shoes for three or four weeks~ I was notified they were out of the requested XS Edge,1
3165,I could either wait for the next delivery of Edge or resole with C4,1
3166,Either set aside the specific rubber for my shoes when you receive them~ or~ let me know right away that you won't have the rubber I've requested,1
3167,I didn't like that they had my shoes for a month before they told me.,1
3168,I had him put no edge resolves on a couple pair of Tenaya shoes for me,1
3169,Mine didn’t turn out well but my daughter loved hers,1
3170,Later I noticed he no longer will do that on non LS shoes so I guess that’s that.,1
3171,Just got a pair of PitchSix EyeSend Adjustable Belay Glasses,1
3172,Pretty legit~ the field of view is adjustable so you can see far more on overhanging routes,1
3173,There's a small lever which makes the frames move to ant angle you need,1
3174,Normal belay glasses don't work super well for steep routes so these are great,1
3175,Especially for multi pitch,1
3176,Durable and come in a good case,1
3177,Recommended over other glasses I've used for sure,1
3178,How much did you get paid to come advertise here?,1
3179,Nothing,1
3180,Just really like the product and I want to support the company,1
3181,They are new and I like what they are doing~ hoping to help get there name out there however I can!,1
3182,Luckily we don't climb hard enough for our $14 ebay ones to not work well enough,1
3183,You know of a lot of multipitch cave routes?,1
3184,Cool idea~ I'll definitely check them out once they are available in physical store,1
3185,I hear alot of controversy about MM Harnesses,1
3186,People either love them or hate them,1
3187,Why do you think that is? Also what are your personal opinions on them?,1
3188,Have you read the previous threads about these harnesses? People express whatever complaints they have in those.,1
3189,I like them~ for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with the nature of their harnesses,1
3190,They're one of the last Made in USA climbing manufacturers,1
3191,They are super loyal and active in Southeastern climbing communities,1
3192,They're nice guys,1
3193,Oh~ and I've never had any issue or complaint about any of their harnesses or boulder pads (not a huge fan of their backpacks~ though).,1
3194,There’s not a lot of people who genuinely hate them; rather~ there’s a lot of people who REALLY love them~ so people say they hate them to troll and/or be “edgy.”,1
3195,My medium sized Turbo is sturdy~ comfy~ and wearing well,1
3196,"I have a 30"" waist and fit right in the middle of its range",1
3197,I wish it had a proper gear loop at the rear though,1
3198,I think I tried to order it that way but don't remember what happened,1
3199,Anyway~ a loop weighs nothing; why aren't more built that way?,1
3200,Love,1
3201,Local shop had a MM Sonic vs an identical looking Black Diamond,1
3202,I hung in both from the eyebolt they'd stuffed into the roof and the difference was amazing,1
3203,The BD hurt~ the MM felt comfy,1
3204,I looked both over and they appeared to be identical~ but the difference was huge,1
3205,I love the volta~ is there anything that compares in size and feel?,1
3206,Sterling Nano IX 9.0 is my favorite rope,1
3207,Slightly lighter than the Volta and it's cheaper!,1
3208,Beal Joker 9.1,1
3209,Probably the least expensive option for a skinny triple-rated rope,1
3210,A bit stiff out of the box~ but it softens up with use.,1
3211,Never used the Volta~ but both the Joker and the Nano listed above are great ropes,1
3212,The nano is way skinnier 'in the hand'~ but the joker is unicore,1
3213,Both are solid options in my opinion~ but if price and availability are the same I'd probably choose the Joker,1
3214,It's just a little more confidence inspiring due to feeling larger and being unicore.,1
3215,I really like my mammut serenity and partners often comment on how nice it is,1
3216,It is an 8.6 mm triple rated rope so it is thinner,1
3217,I am looking forward to the edelrid swift protect pro 8.6 mm rope to be released later this year,1
3218,It should be much more cut resistant~ not that I have had any problems with wear or cutting with the mammut serenity.,1
3219,I think you would find the Sterling Fusion Ion R 9.4 to handle about the same,1
3220,It doesn't feel like a fat rope at all~ which it isn't~ but my BD 9.4 feels like a 10.5mm,1
3221,Volta Guide is a little thinner~ triple rated too~ handles the same and is UIAA dry treated,1
3222,What’s not to like?,1
3223,I had one experience with the volta~ which was positive the first three or so times i climbed with it~ but the rope's sheath deteriorated very quickly,1
3224,Used on maybe 15 or so routes and already ready to chop about 15 feet off of it,1
3225,I won't be buying it again~ even though it does feel real nice right out of the package.,1
3226,Howdy folks~ none of you seem to be talking about these svelte new shoes from scarpa,1
3227,they seem to have taken a look at the five ten XVi (which is~ beyond compare~ the most comfortable aggressive shoe I've ever felt)~ and taken them to their logical conclusion,1
3228,I died inside when five ten canceled the team XVi~ and that was the final straw for the company for me (not selling rubber to resolers anymore was the second last straw)~ so I am tickled pink that there is finally another shoe out there that feels more like a ballet slipper than a mountaineering boot,1
3229,the durability of these shoes is questionable~ but I felt the same way about the teams and ultimately could get a solid year of gym use out of a pair before they were too far gone~ so I am mildly optimistic,1
3230,I've read some bad things about the durability of other newer scarpa footwear (arpias and phantom techs come to mind)~ but hopefully they got these ones right,1
3231,have any of you guys taken these shoes for a spin yet? have you discovered a similar shoe (love volume and sensitivity taken to the extreme) from a different brand that I haven't heard of? I've got a box of furia airs in the mail that I'm itching to take for a spin,1
3232,I demoed them,1
3233,I was on barely overhanging pocketed limestone so not the ideal setting~ but could extrapolate how they'd perform elsewhere,1
3234,I have never worn anything as sensitive,1
3235,I have had several pairs of blue/black teams and tried on xvi's once or twice,1
3236,Furia Air's are much better constructed so I'd guess they'll last longer than vxi's,1
3237,They edge better than expected as well,1
3238,They seem like a perfect shoe for roof smearing,1
3239,Definitely a specialized shoe IMO,1
3240,Furia air actually has a stiffening laterally under the toes that the regular furia S and drago do not,1
3241,It doesn’t run back past the ball of the foot though~ so still ridiculously soft length wise,1
3242,I haven’t tried the furia air yet to give a comparison~ but I think the drago and furia s (climb the same) are a solid team replacement.,1
3243,turd burglar~ Do you have had a chance to climb in the Furia Airs? Have you climbed in the gym or outside with them? What do you think about them so far?,1
3244,A solid replacement if they fit your feet,1
3245,Better constructed than Teams~ but do not fit my feet as well,1
3246,Unparallel makes an XVI replacement called the Leopard,1
3247,In reality it is closer to a Team~ but the people I know that use it really like it,1
3248,Much better construction.,1
3249,I bought a pair of the Furia Air but returned them because they don't fit my feet correct,1
3250,They basically fit the exact same as the Vapor V which for me is too narrow in the toe area and has dead space in the heel,1
3251,Hi~  So i have tried tenaya ra & oasi~ The most comfi shoes i have ever put on,1
3252,Could not find matsia & iati~ but i would love to hear opinions about those models~ and the differences between all of the above,1
3253,Looking for a shoe for sport routes outdoors,1
3254,Thanks!,1
3255,Of the models you asked about...Have and really like the Iati,1
3256,Reasonably sensitive shoe that is a bit stiffer than some of the other Tenaya models I have,1
3257,Edges very well~ smears very well~ and has surprising power in the toe box,1
3258,Really good all-arounder,1
3259,Like other Tenaya models~ it is very comfortable,1
3260,The lacing system does take some getting used to...Haven’t tried these outdoors yet ( winter)~ but the Tarifa and Mundaka models have been stellar performers outdoors,1
3261,Think these will be too.,1
3262,I have the ra and oasi (also tatanka and tarifa),1
3263,comfy for my morton's toe and excellent performance,1
3264,ra's been great for edging~ oasi's been great for hard sport,1
3265,a lot of tenaya shoes tend to fit a narrower foot profile~ especially the tarifa which I can't wear anymore because of how painfully narrow it is for me,1
3266,many of their shoes are generally narrow if you're considering crack climbing in the future i hear the mundaka is for wide feet,1
3267,I'm on my third pair of Oasi right now,1
3268,For the first month I used them I actually hated them and was going to return them because they felt so strange - turns out they were my first pair of shoes that actually fit my feet properly,1
3269,Basically this is the main point for me,1
3270,They're also the perfect combination of response and stiffness for much of the limestone climbing I do~ so I like them for that,1
3271,The downsides I've noticed are: (a) Tenaya doesn't sell them with the separate strap fasteners anymore~ which were really nice~ (b) toehook and heelhook sensitivity are a noticeable step down from my Pythons~ but that comes with the shape I guess~ (c) with age~ the blue heel tensioning band begins to rip where it meets the finger pull loops,1
3272,The top of the rubber that forms the heelcup can begin to delaminate after aggressive heelhooks~ and the white leather above toe knuckles pops holes fairly quickly if you flag a lot on abrasive surfaces,1
3273,Assuming they fit your feet (easy to tell~ <1/4 of a US size stretch over their lifetime)~ I'd recommend them for climbing where toe precision is the main concern,1
3274,I would recommend a softer shoe for places where toe and heelhooks dominate the style,1
3275,Looks like they handle three resoles pretty well in terms of function (not so much in terms of fashion~ but I don't care about that),1
3276,The feel obviously changes but they've never stopped being supremely comfortable.,1
3277,I have worn 4 pairs of Oasis (10m)~ one Oasi LV (9.5m)~ one pair of masai (10m),1
3278,Street size is 11-11.5m If the Oasi fits you~ then the Mastia probably won't,1
3279,The Mastia has a very wide forefoot,1
3280,Like insanely wide,1
3281,Wearing a 9.5m Mastia I can pinch the fabric over the top of the fore foot,1
3282,If you like the Oasi and want a stiffer front end~ the masai is the way to go for skinny feet,1
3283,Unrelated: My oasi's have been through 3 resoles,1
3284,The third started to let got early on all three pairs so I think 3 may be the limit on the Tenaya Oasi's,1
3285,my inti's and ra's feel basically identical...which is great! i really have a hard time telling the difference...,1
3286,Wow thank you so much guys~ I now am more comfortable with oasi women as my choice,1
3287,Thanks!,1
3288,Maybe someone can provide some insight for my issue,1
3289,I have 2 pairs of Oasis and I think they're amazing shoes,1
3290,My favorite so far,1
3291,I feel pretty precise in them,1
3292,However~ I'm starting to realize that my feet are dumb: I have a wide forefoot and a narrow heel,1
3293,To illustrate this point~ I bought some Chacos online before I realized this,1
3294,My foot was almost too wide in the front for the Chacos and almost the exact length I needed~ but the heel area was wayyyyyy too big,1
3295,I've noticed this in my Oasiss~ as well (plus nearly every other shoe I've owned now that I think about it),1
3296,When I first tried them on~ everything felt great,1
3297,After pretty extensive use~ the forefoot still feels precise and tight~ but the heel is so loose it's starting to pop on hooks,1
3298,Before someone says 'downsize'~ I did when I first bought the pair and absolutely could not climb fore more than a minute because they were so tight,1
3299,So~ my question is this: do any of the other Tanaya shoes have the kind of fit that I need or can anyone recommend a shoe with a similar feel but better fit for my dumb feet? Thanks,1
3300,Tenaya Mastia has the wide forefoot~ but for the length I also felt the heel was pretty baggy,1
3301,Have you ever tried the Acro From butora? It has a medium wide front end~ and a painfully small heel cup,1
3302,Once you've broken them in the heel is still fairly snug.,1
3303,The Mastia is not insanely wide,1
3304,If I put it next to a Solution it is still narrower and those are not a wide shoe.,1
3305,Tenaya Mastia has the wide forefoot~ but for the length I also felt the heel was pretty baggy,1
3306,Have you ever tried the Acro From butora? It has a medium wide front end~ and a painfully small heel cup,1
3307,Once you've broken them in the heel is still fairly snug,1
3308,I haven't! My friend has a pair of Butoras and says they're good~ but I've never seen them in the wild otherwise so never had na chance to try em on,1
3309,I've never worn a solution~ but relative to the Oasi~ Masai~ TC Pro~ Scarpa Origin~ and Muira~ the mastia is wider feeling at the size,1
3310,The fabric isn't even tight across my foot.,1
3311,I love my Iati's,1
3312,They're comfortable right out the box~ but still feel and climb like performance shoes,1
3313,My only complaint is with the closure system: there's been plenty of occasions (especially climbing outside) where the velcro strap has undone itself mid-route,1
3314,Usually just a minor inconvenience~ but one worth noting none-the-less.,1
3315,I've never worn a solution~ but relative to the Oasi~ Masai~ TC Pro~ Scarpa Origin~ and Muira~ the mastia is wider feeling at the size,1
3316,The fabric isn't even tight across my foot,1
3317,They're higher volume than other Tenaya shoes~ yes~ but the actual width of the toebox is not wide at all,1
3318,The extra fabric in your photo is the extra volume~ which is usually up-down room in the shoe,1
3319,It is still quite narrow compared to everything else out there including the Skwama that they copied.,1
3320,The Mastia's are huge,1
3321,1 size below my typical Tenaya size~ which is 1 size below my street shoe size~ was still at least 1 size too big,1
3322,For those who want help counting~ that's at least three full sizes below my street shoe size,1
3323,Three,1
3324,I wear my Mastia in a 7.5 US and I’m a 10,1
3325,The Tenaya guys recommended this based on my other shoe sizes,1
3326,It’s .5 below what I would wear an Iati in so that’s not that downsized,1
3327,Tenayas are comfortable but I can imagine how people could wear them as big as they claim,1
3328,Of the sponsored climbers 3 sizes below street is the norm,1
3329,Did you find a significant difference between the Oasi lv and Oasi? I heard heal is more narrow (and supposed to fit female feet) ~ but any thing else.? New Reply to Tenaya,1
3330,Did you find a significant difference between the Oasi lv and Oasi? I heard heal is more narrow (and supposed to fit female feet) ~ but any thing else.? New Reply to Tenaya I'd be interested to hear about this~ too,1
3331,An Oasi with a narrower heel would be perfect for me~ I think,1
3332,Looking at the photos you have very low volume feet,1
3333,I'm a size 10.5 US and an A on the Brannock device,1
3334,Almost everything I use has tons of extra room,1
3335,I have my Mastia in size 7.5 US,1
3336,They fit very snug with little to no extra material anywhere.,1
3337,Looking at the photos you have very low volume feet,1
3338,I'm a size 10.5 US and an A on the Brannock device,1
3339,Almost everything I use has tons of extra room,1
3340,I have my Mastia in size 7.5 US,1
3341,They fit very snug with little to no extra material anywhere,1
3342,Those weren't pictures of my feet,1
3343,Based on occasionally needing wide shoes I'd say I have a marginally high volume foot,1
3344,La Sportiva Miura's (lace-up) were excruciatingly narrow for me.,1
3345," Did you find a significant difference between the Oasi lv and Oasi? I heard heal is more narrow (and supposed to fit female feet) ~ but any thing else.? New Reply to Tenaya The proportions of the shoe are almost the same probably just a few percent ""tighter"" across the whole shoe~ with the exception of less material over the top of the 'ball' of the foot",1
3346,(I'd very subjectively say 7-10% tighter across the ball of the foot,1
3347,And 3-5% everywhere else.)  Basically if you like the Oasi~ you will like the LV,1
3348,For me the difference is basically a super thin pair of socks,1
3349,Looking at the photos you have very low volume feet,1
3350,I'm a size 10.5 US and an A on the Brannock device,1
3351,Almost everything I use has tons of extra room,1
3352,I have my Mastia in size 7.5 US,1
3353,They fit very snug with little to no extra material anywhere,1
3354,Those were my feet~ and yes..,1
3355,They are long and skinny,1
3356,I have a volumetric scan I'll post up in a second.,1
3357,Damn I need to check that app,1
3358,Your feet are higher volume than mine and wider,1
3359,Miura laces also fit me narrow mostly because of the toebox shape,1
3360,Five Ten Dragons~ the old lace up ones~ were about the best thing as you could really customize the fit on a given day,1
3361,The Unparallel replacement is not quite as form fitting,1
3362,Anyways~ The Mastia to me feels like a Skwama and Solution mixed~ but less bulky,1
3363,Pros: -Comfort -Very precise feeling/pointed toebox -Simple strap system that easily allows tensioning one end of the shoe more than the other,1
3364,-Decently sensitive,1
3365,-Can edge on vert pretty well for a split midsole shoe Cons: -Heel twists on hard heel hooks even though it is very form fitting,1
3366,I have only had it worse on a pair of blown out Teams -Why on earth didn't they extend the toe hook rubber up and over more? There is the space for it,1
3367,-Sock liner is nice~ but I like their older liner better,1
3368,Feels more substantial and tensions the top of the foot more,1
3369,The white elastic doesn't do as good of a job,1
3370,-Wish it had the old strap system,1
3371,-Black lining material near the heel has ripped,1
3372,-Tacky looking,1
3373,Not that climbing shoes need to be pretty,1
3374,Just no attention to detail with this shoe it seems.,1
3375,The scan is done by standing on a pad scanner thing at a shoe store,1
3376,Mine was done at a Fleet Feet,1
3377,I'd be surprised if your feet are lower volume,1
3378,Maybe skinner (width wise) but the mastia and skwama both were huge on me volume wise~ with the Toe to heel length being the smallest I fit in without gouging into my achilles.,1
3379,The scan is done by standing on a pad scanner thing at a shoe store,1
3380,Mine was done at a Fleet Feet,1
3381,I'd be surprised if your feet are lower volume,1
3382,Maybe skinner (width wise) but the mastia and skwama both were huge on me volume wise~ with the Toe to heel length being the smallest I fit in without gouging into my achilles,1
3383,The women's Skwama is still huge on me~ Solution is great,1
3384,You're probably right~ but I would be curious just to know,1
3385,I thought I was size 9.5 shoes for years and I'm actually a 10.5~ closer to 11,1
3386,So my feet are probably permanently jacked up.,1
3387,Here’s my take on the Iati,1
3388,Great shoe,1
3389,Comfortable out of the box,1
3390,Medium stiff to soft,1
3391,Oasi is softer,1
3392,My son wears those,1
3393,If you are looking for a pair of shoes as comfortable as the Iati with the same foot/last shape~ but a much better heel cup and a bit stiffer more powerful toe~ the Acopa Merlin fills the bill,1
3394,I own both,1
3395,After a lengthy session last night in a brand new pair of Merlins that needed zero break in and we’re comfortable from the first climb~ I woke up this morning and looked at my gear in the floor and had to ask myself~ what am I going to do with these Tenayas now,1
3396,I love the shoes and I’ll keep them for bouldering sessions where stiffness isn’t required but sensitivity is key,1
3397,The heel cup on the Merlin is full surround with much thicker rubber than my Iatis,1
3398,For face climbs~ thin edges and such~ the Merlin will be my new go to shoe,1
3399,The rubber is a touch harder than the Iati~ yet stickier,1
3400,Both great shoes,1
3401,Both with a place,1
3402,I do know that the Merlin is built stronger than the Iati and will likely last twice as long,1
3403,Hands down my new favorite where previously the Iati held that title,1
3404,Where are you finding the Acopa's? Thought they were discontinued.,1
3405,I’m glad you like the Acopa~ but I can’t imagine choosing a shoe for bouldering that is quite as flat and has almost zero toe hook rubber unless I also had a second pair that was the opposite (Solution/Skwama and Miura type combo),1
3406,I have climbed almost exclusively in tenayas for the last 3-4 years,1
3407,In particular I like the Oasi~ Iati~ Tarifa~ and now~ Mastia,1
3408,The Iati is stiffer than the Oasi~ but the fit is nearly identical,1
3409,I prefer them for the gym and/or overhanging sport routes,1
3410,The tarifa is narrower~ stiffer~ and you can dial in the fit better with the laces - I use them exclusively for eldo~ and most vert/off vert outdoor climbing,1
3411,In general~ this is my preferred outdoor climbing shoe,1
3412,I just started climbing in the Mastia for the last month (note: downsize at least .5 to 1 from your size in Oasis/Iati),1
3413,Wider forefoot~ better heel (for me),1
3414,Have not tried them outside but loving them as my go to hard bouldering gym shoe,1
3415,My shoes are sized quite tight~ but I can still wear them a reasonable amount of time and they are more comfortable for me than equivalently sized shoes in other brands,1
3416,I spoke with 3 Tenaya pros about their shoe choice and it was interesting: -One basically said he chooses whatever he is feeling for a route/project and it can change daily,1
3417,He is not known for being super particular about shoes,1
3418,-Another makes his choice entirely on the heel/toe patch,1
3419,He has recently worn 2 different shoes often as he feels the Oasi heel is more sensitive/thinner~ but that he can't crank on it as hard as the Mastia,1
3420,-The third wears the same shoe all the time,1
3421,Wants predictability,1
3422,Currently really liking the stiffness of the Mastia toe box for granite,1
3423,Personally I need to give the Mastia a bit more of a chance,1
3424,The Oasi is also really comfortable and heel is slightly better for me than the Iati~ but it seems they all overlap so much that going with fit makes the most sense.,1
3425,Mastia definitely fits wider than their other shoes,1
3426,I got wide feet and narrow heels,1
3427,Mastia fits well,1
3428,The only complain I have is whatever the upper material they used aren't comfortable at all,1
3429,They feel like fish netting on my feet.,1
3430,Yup~ they should have used the older liner,1
3431,While they were at it they could have easily used the old strap system and/or not used the white elastic,1
3432,There is nothing to help take any extra volume out of the shoe.,1
3433,Where are you finding the Acopa's? Thought they were discontinued,1
3434,If you haven’t seen the recent announcements here in the forum~ Acopa is back,1
3435,https://acopaoutdoors.com/,1
3436,The original poster didn’t mention looking for bouldering shoes,1
3437,And I don’t use the Merlins for bouldering,1
3438,I’ve got other shoes that I could use in that role,1
3439,I own the Iati,1
3440,Though it lacks a decent toe patch,1
3441,Not that I do a lot of toe hooking,1
3442,Also the Merlins are as downturned as the Iati/Oasi~ if not more,1
3443,Considering Tenaya shoes are not downturned that is not a surprise,1
3444,The Oasi toe patch is already pretty bad for toe hooking and is usually the most criticized portion of the shoe,1
3445,Not saying they're bad,1
3446,I think I mis-read your comment as the Merlins replacing everything as your bouldering shoe where you actually said you'd keep the Tenayas for that.,1
3447,No I'm not much of a boulderer,1
3448,I've got the drive of a 20 year old with the shoulders that reflect every one of my 50 years,1
3449,That's a bad combination and a recipe for pain so I just refrain,1
3450,It's kind of a shame Tenaya doesn't make a shoe with more of a set downturn and more of a toe patch and more rubber in the heel,1
3451,Of course then it would just be a Sportiva,1
3452,Or~ if Sportiva could just make a shoe as comfortable as the Tenaya,1
3453,Merlin hits 3 out of the 4,1
3454,Comfort~ downturn~ heel,1
3455,Toes could have a bit more rubber,1
3456,But at least they put the small patch where it counts unlike that little strip that Tenaya glues on,1
3457,Now I'm wondering why I even like the Tenaya so much,1
3458,Oh yeah,1
3459,It's cause I don't climb hard enough to Really need heels and toes.,1
3460,Oof! I'm 34~ but feeling it more and more every day,1
3461,Tenayas are mad comfortable,1
3462,I don't really know how they do it~ but they do it well,1
3463,Regarding the toe patch- a guy at my gym just bought some resole rubber and glues his own on or has a resoler do it,1
3464,Most of his Mocs and shoes have enhanced patches as his gym shoes are just his old retired shoes.,1
3465,I just picked up my first pair of Tenaya Mundakas after trying on nearly every shoe at my local REI,1
3466,I must have weird shaped feet because everything besides the Mundakas had hot spots or crossed my toes,1
3467,They are extremely comfortable and the padded tongue is a nice touch,1
3468,Just wish they came in colors other than bright green,1
3469,I upgraded from scarpa origins so hard to compare performance but feel great on the wall.,1
3470,Mundakas have become the favorite shoes in my quiver,1
3471,Insanely comfortable,1
3472,Smear and edge very well,1
3473,A bit of downturn helps with power-- yet super comfortable,1
3474,How the heck Tenaya did this I don't know,1
3475,The rest of my quiver are on their way to becoming niche shoes only,1
3476,The only drawback is the lacing system- and that is only until you figure out the subtleties-- then it is yet ANOTHER plus for these amazing shoes,1
3477,Work equally well on plastic~ sandstone~ granite,1
3478,Wow.,1
3479,Thanks for sharing!! Any beta on where can we order one or buy a copy??,1
3480,For North American you might prefer the shipping cost of Verti Call at verticallstore.com,1

3482,I spoke with Pete and he said you can email him directly at passthepitonspete@hotmail.com  he has copies for sale.,1
3483,This is an initial impression of the Boreal Ballet Gold climbing shoe,1
3484,I have only used them in the gym so far to break them in for the outdoor season~ so all of my opinions are based on that.,1
3485,It's nice to see an older shoe (these came out~ what~ 20+ years ago?) that can compete with the oh-so-popular-these-days TC Pro,1
3486,I have to admit~ I get a chuckle watching the new generation rediscover the benefits of a firm shoe.,1
3487,I love these shoes,1
3488,My street shoe is a size 10,1
3489,I go a half size down (9.5) and resole with c4,1
3490,I do the same with the boreal Aces,1
3491,I go up a half size for socks,1
3492,These shoes will take a beating and plenty of resoles.,1
3493,I would do the same if someone still had access to C4 rubber,1
3494,Since Adidas took over~ rubber has not been readily available,1
3495,I'll probably go with the Edge for a resole if it isn't available when the FS Quatro runs out.,1
3496,They are comfy and nice to climb in all day but I hated the rubber that came on them,1
3497,My feet slipped off more stuff in those shoes than any other,1
3498,Maybe I'm just a bad climber though,1
3499,Wild~ I didn't think they made those anymore...,1
3500,I find they are good for small edges~ and jamming.,1
3501,No~ it wasn't you,1
3502,Borea;'s rubber back then WAS that slick.,1
3503,That was on granite too~ I will bust them out on the sandstone around here to see how they perform~ but I may have resoled with another rubber already,1
3504,It may be that your foot shape isn't ideal for the shoe as well,1
3505,5.10's tend fits me really well (spires/coyotes/pinkies)~ due to the square-ish toe box shape though~ so I would be surprised if this shoe doesn't work for you,1
3506,I think it has a very similar last shape,1
3507,I could be wrong.,1
3508,My first climbing shoe was the Ballet~ resole d them 4 times before letting them go,1
3509,Was using C4 on them~ great shoe for cracks and offwidth.,1
3510," ""Since Adidas took over~ rubber has not been readily available"" POSITIVE RESOLES is fully stocked with ALL newer Five Ten Rubber (C4~ Onyxx~ MI6~ High Friction~ ""Dot"")",1
3511,That said~ Adidas is once again selling Five Ten C4 (4.2mm).,1
3512,Super good news!  I'll have a pair for you in about 8 weeks (if the weather stays nice),1
3513,Black Hills stone does a number on shoes.,1
3514,Buck~ I should have mentioned that POSITIVE RESOLES not only has C4 in stock~ it also has all the different thicknesses available ( C4 in 3.5mm~ 4.2mm and 5mm),1
3515,Also Onyxx in both 3.5mm and 4.2mm (and HF 4.2 and MI6 4.2mm),1
3516,Topping it off~ XS EDGE and XS GRIP 2 are also AVAILABLE,1
3517,:-),1
3518,With all of the negative press about the FS Quattro~ you'd think Boreal would re-formulate their rubber or buy it from someone else,1
3519,I don't think the stuff is terrible~ but it sure isn't C4 or Onyxx either.,1
3520," ""With all of the negative press about the FS Quattro"" I agree!  FS Quatro and Fusion are CRAP! Many other companies use VIbram rubber(s) (XS EDGE and XS Grip 2 as an example)",1
3521,"Needless to say~ Five Ten and C4 remains the #1 choice for ""those in the know""",1
3522,:-),1
3523,You do realize that the primary sizing for Boreal is in Brit sizing~ which runs larger by about one number than US sizes,1
3524,Boreal is really consistent on sizes~ but I usually look at the Euro size listing to find the right size,1
3525,So~ for me a Boreal size looks like this: 6.5~ 40.0~ 7.5,1
3526,The first number~ which is usually larger and in bold~ is the UK size,1
3527,For the record~ I wear 39.5 in Sportiva~ and 7 or 7.5 in 5.10.,1
3528,If it's a board lasted shoe that you're wanting~ I highly recommend BOREAL  ACES and BALLET GOLDS (C4 for improved performance) They do run a little on the narrow side~ so platform feet need not apply,1
3529,"For a wider fitting board lasted shoe~ consider the BUTORA ""Mantra"" (Better with C4)null",1
3530,I was able to get out this weekend to try the shoes out~ sized one down from street shoe,1
3531,I found that it still ran large and I wasn’t getting the edging performance I need,1
3532,I thought the rubber was a decent performer on the routes I climbed,1
3533,It would probably be better with a resole~ I’m sure,1
3534,Tough luck on the sizing,1
3535,It must be the shape of my foot~ or your foot~ that determines how far to size down,1
3536,There is no way I can wear a size 9.5 much less a 9 (US) with a 10.5 foot,1
3537,It would cripple me,1
3538,The laces on 1/2 size down are spread about an inch apart already!,1
3539,Rubber sucks~ and theyre too stiff and bulky for anything but hand crack and up,1
3540,That is where they shine~ my favorite Creek shoe for #1 and bigger~ and maybe for all day moderate routes~ but it's too bad they aren't a better all around shoe,1
3541,Sexy as hell and high tops rule.,1
3542,Agreed~ this is more of a specialty shoe for me,1
3543,I will generally just pull on either Mythos or some many-times-re-soled 5.10 Spires or Coyotes,1
3544,But those shoes are not comfortable in long splitter cracks~ at least not for me.,1
3545,Mentioned before but I will bring it up again,1
3546,NOMAD VENTURES (Joshua Tree) carries BOREAL shoes,1
3547,Aces and Ballet Golds however need to be ORDERED and paid for in advance,1
3548,But they ARE still available.,1
3549,More to add on this shoe:  did 10 pitches yesterday on three climbs(8 am to 4 pm) and had these shoes on almost the entire time,1
3550,Took a break for water and snacks & removed them,1
3551,By the end of the day my feet were pretty sore~ but not because of the shoes~ but because I neglected to cut my toenails..,1
3552,two of the pitches were majority crack~ with some face holds thrown in,1
3553,One was a finger to hand~ which these shoes did OK on~ the finger portion was in a corner so you could just wedge your foot in the corner,1
3554,When you moved to the hand crack on the face whole toe would go in,1
3555," The last pitch was about a 4""-10"" OW/squeeze in stacked basalt columns",1
3556,The Ballet Gold rocked~ I truly think it lowered the difficulty one whole grade for me,1
3557,"My partner was wearing Muiras~ and he was like ""Dude~ that was a rad lead""",1
3558,"I told him ""It was the shoes!""  Since he was on a TR~ he was able to do a lot more face climbing outside of the crack~ whereas I had to put pro in and pretty much stay in the crack",1
3559,The only bummer was a section where a wide stem would have gotten me off my arms and a needed rest~ but the smearing ability of the native rubber just isn't that good,1
3560,really would be better with a re-sole with either C4 or XS Edge,1
3561,I am a big fan of C4,1
3562,thanks,1
3563,My bad~ I like C4/GRIP....But I have been happy as well with the XS Edge on a really tight fitting pair of Mythos I have in the Purple.,1

3565,Onyxx is god but they aren't shipping it for resoles are they?,1
3566," No~ but if a man of your stature is to say ""Buck Rio you MUST try Onyxx on your next re-sole""~ I would be compelled to do so",1

3569,"LOL! So~ I pretty much avoid ""recommending""",1
3570,That said~ I do suggest that if one likes XS Edge and has not yet tried Onyxx~ MAYBE they should consider giving it a try,1
3571,As far as Boreal Golds/ACES and rubber thickness~ it depends,1
3572,"One~ if they're ""Stackable""~ then stacking with 3.5 is probably a better way to go~ to avoid the ""Frankenstein syndrome"" (aka: platform shoes) Two~ If not stacking~ either~ depending on desired sensitivity (marginal)",1
3573,"As far as personal choice? C4 on ACES/Ballet Golds is the ticket to ride! Hell of a good combination! and I prefer ""STACKING"" for a few of reasons",1
3574,Main one being using the rubber of choice,1

3589,Buck Rio..,1
3590,"""So does the re-soler sand down the original rubber so it doesn't get to high?""",1
3591,Yes,1
3592,If they were new~ approximately 3mm off,1

3604,It will be AOK!,1
3605,I sent them to an address that differs from the one that Kelsey will tell you to ship them to if you ask him,1
3606,I sent them to 61795 Twentynine Palms Highway~ and I guess they probably have a PO box that they normally get shipped to.,1
3607,Buck~ correct! PO Box is where they'd usually go,1
3608,But it appears that Kelsey (Positive Resoles and Nomad Ventures Management) had you send them directly to Nomad Ventures (Climbing store).,1
3609,Glad you got it sorted.,1
3610,Locker....,1
3611,Question,1
3612,This stacking is old news right?  Kris and I got lessons from Charles,1
3613,We would slowly..,1
3614,so as not to get the rubber hot..,1
3615,grid off about 3/4 of the original sole and slap on stealth slipper rubber,1
3616,It made for a edge that wouldn’t roll off and they would stick if you needed to smear,1
3617,When the “good glue” stopped being around we stopped doing home resoles,1
3618,How good is the glue now?  Do they use a heat press now days?,1
3619,"  ""This stacking is old news right?"" Correct! ""How good is the glue now?"" As far as glues go~ some are better~ others aren't",1
3620,"""Do they use a heat press now days?"" :Some do~ some don't",1
3621,The glues used can be/are heat activated,1
3622,Which is also why it can be a problem climbing in the hot summer and leaving shoes in hot cars~ standing around on the hot ground between climbs,1
3623,All setting up for the dreaded DELAM...,1
3624,THX....,1
3625,​I guess that explains why some are better than others,1
3626,Buck~ Nice review! Rock and roll!,1
3627,These things seem to come in waves,1
3628,When I started (not TOO far back but not yesterday) stiff shoes were all the rage with Miuras~ Solutions~ etc while the “old traddies” crushed with super soft Moccs,1
3629,Then No-edge came around and people started rediscovering the benefits of a soft shoe,1
3630,Personally~ I like to feel what I’m standing on...,1
3631,As in...Charles Cole?,1
3632,No~ it wasn't you,1
3633,Borea;'s rubber back then WAS that slick,1
3634,I remember taking the Ace~ back when it was a brand new shoe~ to Stone Mtn~ NC for some terrifyingly slippery friction climbing..,1
3635,Probably the worst place ever to wear them~ especially new,1
3636,Great fit but horrible rubber back then,1
3637,The FS-Quattro rubber that is original to both the Ace and Ballet Gold is not that terrible~ it just isn't as good as most modern rubbers,1
3638,One thing I can say is that it is durable,1
3639,I couldn't really tell if I had worn ANY of the rubber off before I sent them in,1
3640,The edged really well from the get go~ they just didn't really smear well,1
3641,But without a doubt~ the re-sole makes them a A-One shoe for vertical and under terrain,1
3642,Regarding soft shoes: they suck if you have plantar fasciitis,1
3643,"And most of the climbs I do were done long ago in crap resembling tennis shoes~ so I don't ""need"" aggressive shoes anyway",1
3644,That said~ I love my Cobras for the gym and short sport climbs.,1
3645," ""As in...Charles Cole?"" I'll answer for them",1
3646,YES..,1
3647,BUCK RIO..,1
3648,"""One thing I can say is that it is durable",1
3649,"I couldn't really tell if I had worn ANY of the rubber off before I sent them in."" LMAO!!!..",1
3650,That's funny as hell...,1
3651,These things seem to come in waves,1
3652,When I started (not TOO far back but not yesterday) stiff shoes were all the rage with Miuras~ Solutions~ etc while the “old traddies” crushed with super soft Moccs,1
3653,Then No-edge came around and people started rediscovering the benefits of a soft shoe,1
3654,Personally~ I like to feel what I’m standing on..,1
3655,I'm sorry Ted~ but a Muira is NOT a stiff shoe,1
3656,A stiff shoe would be something that is board lasted: something like a LS Synchro or Boreal Ace or even the LS Kaukulator,1
3657,I heard from a very notable climber not to stack rubbers,1
3658,"My own bad experience of having ""stacked"" resoled shoes quickly deteriorate into sloppy sandwiches of delam'd rubber layers supports the argument ""no-stacking"" camp",1
3659,The shoes were resoled by positive edge (post locker) and are now being sent elsewhere for a fix up,1
3660,Stacking seems to me to be what a resolers does when they're too lazy to take the original rubber off.,1
3661,I think I somewhat agree with you,1
3662,I just got two pair back from the resoler~ one pair of La Sportiva Mythos and one pair of La Sportiva Synchro's,1
3663,The Mythos had rubber stacked on them~ and they are unusable,1
3664,The space in the toe has changed so it is like trying to put your foot into a wedge,1
3665,I wore them on Saturday for 3 hours and my big toenail on my left foot is now purple with blood under it,1
3666,It was very painful,1
3667,They also don't fit into thinner cracks now~ cracks that they used to be perfect in they now don't quite fit,1
3668,Sorry to hear about your resoles~ we do guarantee our work,1
3669,If anyone has any issues with their resoles~ contact us at Positive Resoles and we will do what we can to make things right,1
3670,Stacked resoles are easier and quicker to do~ which is why I charge less for them,1
3671,I only do a stacked resole if a customer selects it on the order form or asks for it,1
3672,Stacked resoles are the least likely resole to change the fit/shape of the shoe because it is less invasive to the shoe,1
3673,We reached out to Buck to clear up some confusion regarding his post,1
3674,His Mythos were not stacked and received a regular resole with C4 thick 5.5mm and a new rand,1
3675,His Synchros received the stacked resole,1
3676,Thicker rubber can make the shoe have more tension (affecting fit) and will make the shoe thicker (from top of the toes to the bottom of the sole)~ which can be noticeable in cracks,1
3677,Resoles with thick rubber will stiffen a shoe and may require some break in to soften back up.,1
3678,I in no way will blame Positive Resoles for the fit of my Mythos,1
3679,They have had many multiple resoles from 3 different resolers,1
3680,They just maybe are too old and worn out for another resole,1
3681,The leather fit me like a second skin~ so I am a little sad to have them not fit perfectly,1
3682,But I'll still do single pitch stuff with them~ and maybe they will come back,1
3683,But they pinch me too much right now to take on any multipitch stuff,1
3684," ""Stacking seems to me to be what a resolers does when they're too lazy to take the original rubber off."" Stacking is not the right way to go for all shoes~ nor all climbers",1
3685,It is not done out of laziness~ but instead done to increase the life of shoes~ and of course to add new rubber,1
3686,It also helps maintain the original shape,1
3687,As far as delams go~ all shoes and rubber can and will delaminate depending on conditions,1
3688,High summer heat of course being the worst,1
3689,All glues used~ are heat activated,1
3690,This time of year~ it's not uncommon to get some delamination,1
3691,Things that can help are to avoid leaving shoes in a hot car and don't stand around in them on the hot ground,1
3692,Remove between climbs when possible,1
3693,Delams are an easy fix,1
3694,If your shoes start to delam~ head to Home Depot or similar and get a small wire brush and a decent contact cement such as BARGE (Or equivalent),1
3695,"Clean and ""Rough up"" both surfaces using the wire brush",1
3696,Get it to where the brushed rubber takes on a dull look,1
3697,Don't touch the area! (Grease on fingers will mess it up!).Follow instructions,1
3698," Bingo! For the record~ I always climb in ""STACKED"" Boreal ACES (Or Ballet Golds) and have for many years",1
3699,"""Stacking"" works well and is a plus! No if's~ and's or but's about it! But you do need to know what the advantages/disadvantages are~ and to choose accordingly",1
3700,"SIDE NOTE: ""I heard from a very notable climber not to stack rubbers."" I have personally ""Stacked"" countless pairs of shoes for ""Very notable climbers"" (With zero complaints)",1
3701,Just saying...,1
3702,It has been a year~ and I am still in love with these shoes,1
3703,They got a re-sole with 5.10 C4 rubber from Positive Resoles in JTree in August  2018,1
3704,They have really shined in certain areas,1
3705,The Black Hills granite~ with all the crystals~ is perfect for these shoes,1
3706,I used them exclusively there,1
3707,I brought some softer Velcro's~ but it gets painful standing on tiny crystals with a softer shoe,1
3708,Lumpy Ridge is another place~ with all the weird flaring cracks~ the Boreal Ballet Gold outperformed my Mythos~ 5.10 Coyote and 5.10 Gambit,1
3709,I imagine they would also be excellent on JTree edging routes~ but they smear decent as well,1
3710,They have held up really well~ no major delamination's~ no blown seams~ pull tabs are intact~ they haven't stretched much but have gotten more comfortable,1
3711,These are a 2-3 hour shoe for me~ not all day,1
3712,If I could only have three pair of shoes~ I would take the Boreal Ballet Gold~ 5.10 Anasazi Lace (Pink)~ and a tight slipper for the gym (Cobra/Skwama/Solution),1
3713,I think I'm on my 3rd pair of Ballets and 4th pair of Aces,1
3714,My latest Ballet are the loosest yet and I can actually leave them on all day,1
3715,I didn't lose much performance going a bigger size,1
3716,I used to wear my Aces  2.5 sizes smaller now I get them in a UK size one full size smaller than my US size,1
3717,I think most kids today started off not weighing as much as adults so they don't understand the need for a broad lasted shoe,1
3718,Or what they can do for you,1
3719,Another thing about these shoes is the heal is raised this helps you when you are edge'n it helps you reach those edges as it adds about 2 inches to your reach,1
3720,Good review Buck,1
3721,I love these for granite but prefer a non-braod lasted thin slippers for volcanic rock,1
3722,By the way as much as I miss my Viper's ( pre Colbra ) the Ninja is being completely revamped and they look awesome! See Boreal outdoor for a look at them,1
3723,​http://www.borealoutdoor.com/en/products/details/boreal-ninja​​​,1
3724,Lon: I have both the Cobra and the Ninja...I think the softer of the two is the Cobra for sure,1
3725,Didn't jump on the slipper wagon until after the Vipers were gone,1
3726,These days I'm actually liking my ballet golds for routes here in red rock,1
3727,I've even climbed some at my limit in them,1
3728,They perform much better once you resole with good rubber.,1
3729,Got a pair of Ballet Golds a few weeks ago to replace my beloved but too-many-times-resoled Tradmasters,1
3730,These shoes wrap my feet like a glove and are the most comfortable climbing shoes I've ever worn,1
3731,The downside is how stiff they are,1
3732,Don't get me wrong~ I love a good edge~ but for the first 5 or so sessions in them it felt like walking on wooden blocks - zero sensitivity in my toes~ zero ability to bend the sole,1
3733,They are finally starting to break in a bit with some flex in the forefoot,1
3734,And maybe I'm just getting used to the feel,1
3735,They definitely were a winner outside in offwidth and for jamming cracks,1
3736,Amazing lack of foot pain~ which is a serious plus,1
3737,I haven't tried slab in them yet,1
3738," Laura~ if you re-sole them~ I find C4 to be the perfect ""blend"" of smeari-ness  and still able to hold an edge",1
3739,I used them on Lumpy and BoCan granite~ and SD Needles crystals...equally good.,1
3740,isn't that literally how these shoes are constructed? They are board lasted~ though I not sure what the board is made out of,1
3741,isn't that literally how these shoes are constructed? They are board lasted~ though I not sure what the board is made out of,1
3742,Yes~ I've had board lasted shoes before (Tradmasters) and very much appreciate the support they provide,1
3743,Climbing domes in Tuolumne in slipper-soft Mythos was hell on earth for me because of the lack of support for multiple pitches and hanging belays with no real relief from the pressure on my bent feet,1
3744,Maybe I just don't remember the break-in period from my Tradmasters when they were new~ but the brand new Ballet Golds seemed a heck of a lot stiffer~ to the point where the sole did not flex at all even when applying my fully body weight to the toes and trying to bend my foot to raise my heel,1
3745,Just noting that the break-in period is pretty prolonged for these shoes,1
3746,I do like them better than any alternative I've tried,1
3747," Laura~ if you re-sole them~ I find C4 to be the perfect ""blend"" of smeari-ness  and still able to hold an edge",1
3748,I used them on Lumpy and BoCan granite~ and SD Needles crystals...equally good,1
3749,Thanks for this,1
3750,I will definitely ask for C4 when I get them resoled,1
3751,The nice thing about buying full priced shoes from Rock and Resole is that you get a voucher for a free half-resole,1
3752,I'm still playing around with the original soles~ but for these shoes~ I may go in for that resole sooner than normal.,1
3753,well that's stupid,1
3754,it was the only reason to buy them,1
3755,well that's stupid,1
3756,it was the only reason to buy them,1
3757,If they can retain the stiffness without board lasting~ more power to them,1
3758,I just don't see how they will do it.,1
3759,Well~ the new versions look good,1
3760,Did they mention the rubber they plan to use?,1
3761,If they can retain the stiffness without board lasting~ more power to them,1
3762,I just don't see how they will do it,1
3763,I've seen slip lasted shoes with all sorts of stiff midsoles,1
3764,Some are at least as stiff as the B,1
3765,Golds~ if not more so,1
3766,So the type of construction shouldn't be that big of a deal.,1
3767,I like how pointy the front of the ballet golds are~ it is a nice contrast compared to the TC pros,1
3768,The new version looks more like the TC pro shape,1
3769,They changed the shape of both shoes,1
3770,I just don't understand why they didn't just make two New shoes for their line up and leave the winning team alone?  I'm not impressed to say the least and I really like Boreal.,1
3771,SHIT...,1
3772,Evolv General is a great option for a stiff high top,1
3773,If they can retain the stiffness without board lasting~ more power to them,1
3774,I just don't see how they will do it,1
3775,I had a pair of aces back in the day and they climbed a lot  better after I took the the cardboard board they use for a midsole while they board lasted the shoe,1
3776,I just wet it an peel it most of it from inside of the shoe,1
3777,The stiffness of the shoesis from the material used ~ has nothing to do with the type construction,1
3778,I’m not talking about what the last is made out of,1
3779,What I’m talking about is the board part in board lasted and that is cardboard that becomes part of the final shoe,1
3780,I’m not talking about what the last is made out of,1
3781,What I’m talking about is the board part in board lasted and that is cardboard that becomes part of the final shoe,1
3782,It is a cardboard like material~ for sure,1
3783,It is a cardboard like material~ for sure,1
3784,It is pretty dense and it is coated with plastic or wax,1
3785,I’m surprised that people that love stiff shoes don’t make make an insert to stiffen the shoe,1
3786,Making shoe is very lo tech process all you need is a fork knife and spoon,1
3787,Just wanted to post this quick review/observation of the dmm dragonfly cams,1
3788,Using a red here as an example but still applies to the set,1
3789,Dmm makes great stuff with attention to detail,1
3790,I've used many of their products with no issues,1
3791,My one concern~ which is major~ pertains to the spring gap located in the middle of each set of lobes,1
3792,The gap goes around the whole axle,1
3793,I've had serious issues with dirt and grit build up even after only using the cam on the first go,1
3794,This is a major flaw for these,1
3795,I've posted a pic of an x4 for comparison~ side by side with the red dragonfly,1
3796,The lobes are crammed together in the x4 at the top,1
3797,With very tight tolerances,1
3798,Thus reducing dirt and grit build up,1
3799,Just not the case for the dragonfly,1
3800,When cam'd ~ the gap is peaked at its largest opening~ making any grit insanely easy to get in even as soon as the cam is entered into rock,1
3801,Because the springs are located 'between ' lobes friction is then created between the lobes from grit,1
3802,Now the x4s still show a spring opening when cam'd~ but because each lobe has it's own spring you never get friction between lobes( meaning no issues when camming).I'd love to hear Dmm's explanation,1
3803,I mainly climb sandstone and the grit is definitely small enough to significantly effect the longevity of these,1
3804,For the money your paying~ I'd role with the x4s or tcu's before expecting these to last,1
3805,It seems to me that this is not actually a problem for the whole set of Dragonflies~ but only the 3 smallest sizes,1
3806,The larger ones (blue and up) have internally recessed cam springs much like the x4s~ and there are no big gaps.,1
3807,Tim~  I personally have not had the grit issue with the X4s,1
3808,The real issue is when grit gets between and/or underneath the Springs,1
3809,When this happens cleanings no go,1
3810,Residual build-up on the outside sure can be blown out,1
3811,But in the Springs or underneath it's a no go,1
3812,Can u take apart and reswag~ sure~ but most people won't have these tools,1
3813,I don't really see a reason to contact dmm,1
3814,This is their design to get the Lobes this small~ no changing it~ and the issue is there,1
3815,Hence the reason for this review on their current design,1
3816,Danny  You are correct that this is only for the 3 smallest sizes ( Which is what most people would want to fit the nitty gritty tail end of their rack),1
3817,I’ve had a similar experience as the OP~ however they are easy to clean,1
3818,My main gripe is that they buckle so easily and can’t be placed precisely because of the wobble-y-ness,1
3819,If you’re using a cam that small~ hopefully the crack is clean and not full of grit to increase the odds they hold,1
3820,An anecdote,1
3821,I recently purchased two of the smallest dragonfly cams,1
3822,First day out I took a few decent-sized falls on the smallest piece (#1~ green),1
3823,The unit held the falls~ but suffered some damage,1
3824,Broken trigger wire and two smeared lobes,1
3825,The action on the two 'unscathed' lobes is now limited by the tweaked head angle of the cam and what feels like grit in the springs,1
3826,On one hand~ I recognize that the mechanics of any micro are delicate and that falling on them can tweak them enough to cause issues with future performance,1
3827,Having said that~ I've never had issues with C3s or small aliens after falls,1
3828,The inner lobes are so small and close to the stem that I can't replace the trigger wire at home,1
3829,It's surprising to have a brand new piece of gear to be so easily and seriously damaged,1
3830,In the end: the gear caught the falls and broken gear is the cost of doing business~ but I don't think I'll get more dragonflies.,1
3831,I had the same issue with my X4 .1/.2 offset with the exception of the smeared lobes,1
3832,But~ the softer metal on the lobes is the reason I went with dragonflies for my micros.,1
3833,The life span on tiny cams always seems short except for the c3’s,1
3834,I love the blue alien but mine broke every time I fell on it,1
3835,It held but always blew a trigger wire,1
3836,Iv heard the same for the x4’s,1
3837,I was hoping for more strength in the dragon flys...bummer Small master cams get gunked up easy too,1
3838,I think I’ve only aided off my C3 0 and 00s but I have seen a few f-ed up from actual falls,1
3839,I did break a 000 on a fall with it at my feet,1
3840,Held but got mangled,1
3841,Took one fall on the red dragonfly and it’s fine except a few little crystal dents on the lobes,1
3842,My belief is that I’d rather have the gear get mangled and hold than always look great but not actually hold a fall,1
3843,You place pro for a reason,1
3844,Absolutely agree,1
3845,At the same time~ a unit (that retails for 80$) should be able to hold up for more than one day out/a couple of falls,1
3846,I've been using various things for a personal anchor while sport climbing,1
3847,But mostly just a long sling girth-hitched to my harness with a locker on the other end,1
3848,I've also tried the typical chain-link style PAS things (like Metolius),1
3849,And I gotta say~ I like the Petzl Connect Adjust much more,1
3850,Sure~ it's not as lightweight as a sling~ but the fact that it's instantly and infinitely adjustable in the blink of an eye makes it much more valuable to me,1
3851,Y'all can look it up~ but it's basically a short length of dynamic rope attached to a mini self-locking belay device of sorts,1
3852,It locks up in the same way an ATC Guide or Petzl Reverso would lock in guide mode,1
3853,And you girth-hitch it to your harness just like you would any of the other systems,1
3854,But you get to the top of your climb and simply clip this thing to the anchor or bolt and pull in the slack a bit,1
3855,Done,1
3856,And you can release it to lengthen your anchor or pull it to shorten,1
3857,It works really smooth,1
3858,And unlike the PAS type of designs~ you don't need to mess with a carabiner or unclip or open a gate to shorten or lengthen yourself,1
3859,Can't use it as an actual anchor to belay or climb on (like the Metolius PAS),1
3860,But I don't know many people who actually do that anyway,1
3861,It also stows away on your harness better than a PAS,1
3862,I have one end girth-hitched to my belay loop and the locker just clips to my harness wherever,1
3863,And I tuck the slack under my leg loop,1
3864,So when I'm climbing~ it's not dangling around,1
3865,And when I want to use it~ I just grab the locker like a quick draw and pull,1
3866,Easy,1
3867,This is actually a piece of gear I'm glad I bought and don't mind carrying,1
3868,Nice design!,1
3869,I use a Sterling rope Purcell prusik,1
3870,mediacdn.shopatron.com/medi…   great adjustability~ dynamic rope~ lightweight~ compact,1
3871,the best part~ theyre about $10 a piece~ compared to $50 for the petzl.,1
3872," Lol~    I use the Petzl Evolv Adjust for aid climbing and I cannot imagine anyone thinking for even a moment that the Petzl Connect ""stows away on your harness better than a PAS or anything else",1
3873,Considering my Evolvs use thinner rope~ I can't even imagine how bulky the extra cord must be when using the thicker rope used in the Connect,1
3874,I've used purcell prussics before and didn't stick with them because of their bulky nature and I'd happily marry the purcell if it meant I could kill the connect (and F the Evolv~ yum!),1
3875,I don't really know how you're stowing a PAS or whatever you use~ but how I do it:   I adjust it so the rope is pulled all the way out of the locking device,1
3876,Then clip the locker to my harness like a quick draw,1
3877,Then I tuck the extra length of rope under my leg loop,1
3878,Seems to be out of the way and isn't bulky at all,1
3879,But hey~ I'm not forcing you to like it lol,1
3880,This is just my findings on it,1
3881,A PAS is way more bulky to me,1
3882,The chain-link nature of it means it doesn't really coil up or anything,1
3883,You have to double it up once or even twice on a carabiner to get it out of the way,1
3884,And that is more bulky to me,1
3885,But whatever~ do what you want man,1
3886,A simple sling with a carabiner on it is definitely less bulky than any of 'em,1
3887,But a sling isn't adjustable,1
3888,I kinda do it like this,1
3889,But I tuck the extra a little wider so it isn't dangling.youtube.com/watch?v=RY5PlN6…,1
3890,Just dropping in to say that whatever I'm doing is infinitely more clever~ thrifty~ and original than this,1
3891,Oxford commas are my thing.,1
3892,The Connect Adjust definitely seems like a great solution~ but as previously mentioned~ expensive,1
3893,Any thoughts or experience with the Kong Slyde as much cheaper alternative? Slyde Kong Slyde,1
3894,i use a kong slyde~ it's not as smooth as the petzl to release but pulling it in tighter works fine,1
3895,i'm happy for the price,1
3896,What~ exactly~ is the need for all this adjust-ability when cleaning sport routes?   All you need is something that puts you a comfortable distance from the anchor while cleaning,1
3897,This really doesn't change,1
3898,Aid climbing is another matter~ but OP specifically mentioned sport.,1
3899,Well that's fine~ man,1
3900,You don't have to get one lol,1
3901,There's no point in me trying to argue with you as your mind is already made up,1
3902,Me? I like the thing and I'm happy I got it,1
3903,:) Because no..,1
3904,not every anchor has the same stance and not every stance puts you at the same distance from the anchor,1
3905,That's my experience,1
3906,If yours is different~ so be it.,1
3907,I own the dual connect adjust,1
3908,Overall~ I think the slider design is the best available for a PAS,1
3909,However~ there are other aspects of the design that could be significantly improved,1
3910,In my opinion~ the rope diameter used (9.5mm) is overkill,1
3911,I lead climb and take falls on skinner ropes..,1
3912,When climbing with a full trad rack~ I find the extra bulk and dangly bits annoying,1
3913,This past weekend my partner was using the Connect Adjust and I got interested in getting one for myself,1
3914,But after taking a look at the Kong Slyde~ I went ahead an ordered one for less than $15,1
3915,I can sacrifice a few feet off of my old 9.8 rope to build the tether,1
3916,I think that's the only big difference (besides price) between the Connect and Slyde~ how Petzl provides this fancy bartacked tether for girth hitching,1
3917,Anyone who uses the Slyde~ any tips~ lessons~ recommendations? Thanks!,1
3918,Umm..,1
3919,is that not the point?      If you guys are spending so much time at the anchor cleaning a sport route that comfort becomes an issue to the point where you need an infinitely adjustable connection so you can get positioned just right~ you're probably doing something wrong..,1
3920,What are you doing up there?,1
3921,oh and by the way to me at least~ it doesn't really matter how you do something in climbing (as long as you are being safe) or what gear you use,1
3922,Everybody has an opinion and they are all different,1
3923,The key is the thought process behind it~ because all of the different methods of doing things have trade offs,1
3924,The key is knowing what the tradeoffs are and then making a decision based on that,1
3925,Different people will come to different decisions based on the personal preference and the style of climbing and the location,1
3926,So I will give you another chance,1
3927,What would you say the main advantage of this adjustable thing is over a clove hitch?  Why would you recommend to myself or anyone else that they go buy it?   Why do you chose it over a clove hitch?  I get that you like the adjustability~ but a clove hitch also has that~ so what else?,1
3928,main advantage over a clove is the ease of adjustability,1
3929,with a clove hitch~ you have to feed slack in or out to adjust whereas this thing you can just clip and pull until it comes taut on you,1
3930,On the other hand~ I don't see the need for such adjustability just for cleaning your typical sport anchor because it doesn't really take that long,1
3931,I mean~ if you're taking more than a minute to clean a sport anchor~ you're doing it wrong.,1
3932,I could see the benefit of using the Connect at the top of a route before rapping back down,1
3933,At some point you gotta go in direct so the ropes can be freed to rap with,1
3934,I can think of plenty of ice routes and some rock where the adjustment could come in handy to stay comfortable,1
3935,I could see using the Connect if you wanted to tether in but not extend your rappel,1
3936,I wouldn't buy one either but I also wouldn't pull the typical point and laugh at the PAS thong either.,1
3937,For some reason~ carrying an installed tether seems to be a reflexive flashpoint for some people~ who get all bent out of shape at the mere mention of the idea,1
3938,No doubt some of those responses will show up here,1
3939,I bought a Connect 'cause I'm a working stiff and can afford it~ I've always been interested in experimenting with and understanding new gear~ and I can probably sell it (at the fantastic Rock and Snow Consignment store) and recoup some of the cost if I end up not liking it,1
3940,So far~ I have only used it for a few days of cragging at the Gunks (where an installed tether is hardly a necessity)~ and have not yet made up my mind about its ultimate utility,1
3941,The weight isn't an issue,1
3942,Some climbers will object to the bulk; the main source is the sewn loop that you girth-hitch to your belay loop,1
3943,I typically wrap my tether around my waist and clip it back to itself; since the Connect has no loops (as a PAS does) it doesn't snag as much when unwrapping,1
3944,Personally~ I find it to be a bit on the short side~ but this is true of some of the PAS's as well,1
3945,Another foot or so would be nice,1
3946,It does almost everything a tether does better (and more safely in view of its lower impact loading)~ but I'm speaking of multipitch trad climbing and alpine climbing here~ where there are a host of situations that are improved and/or sped up by a tether,1
3947,(I wouldn't carry any kind of tether just to transfer from climbing to lowering on a single-pitch sport climb.) For leading or following improvised aid and when aiding to clean stuck gear~ the Connect is significantly better than anything else (other than an adjustable daisy~ which almost no one I know carries as a tether since those gadgets can't withstand much in the way of fall loads),1
3948,It is excellent for instantaneous addition of~ say~ a horizontal or upward directional point to a belay anchor,1
3949,The fact that you can shorten it while it is loaded confers advantages in some climbing and self-rescue situations,1
3950,Since the Connect is made with a length of dynamic rope~ I'd consider utilizing it as one arm of a belay anchor,1
3951,This could speed up certain anchoring situations~ especially those with only two anchor points~ but the relative shortness of the connect restricts this application somewhat,1
3952,PAS-style tethers are a little better as rappel rigs and for the (very occasional for me) clipping of more than one anchor point,1
3953,If you want to rappel extended with the Connect~ you either have to use a separate sling to extend the device or else clove-hitch a carabiner midway along the connect to hold the rap device,1
3954,The clove hitch shortens the Connect~ which is already on the short side~ as I've said,1
3955,Edit (September 18~ 2017):  I've had it for about half a year now,1
3956,Used it for some improvised aid in very wet conditions~ for multipitch climbs and rappels from the Gunks to the Tetons,1
3957,I'd guess I use it on about half the belay anchors I set up,1
3958,I've decided on balance that I like it a lot,1
3959,It's a game-changer for improvised aid and hanging to remove stuck gear~ and since most folks have never had an anchor they could adjust one-handed after setting it up~ they don't know what they are missing in terms of  increased comfort when the position they've committed yourself to starts to hurt a little,1
3960,I've tried someone else's Kong Slide~ (I think set up with an 8.5mm rope) and find it ok for tightening~ although the Petzl gadget is smoother~ but worse for loosening~ so the Connect wins for overall utility.,1
3961,I love how insecure climbers are,1
3962,"  ""hey I use X.""   ""oh~ I use Y because I don't like this about X.'   ""fine",1
3963,whatever,1
3964,don't buy one then,1
3965,"whatever.""   ""hey~ I use X'   ""me too.""   ""you're so cool.""",1
3966,I have the dual connect adjust (has a pigtail for extending your rappel) and I quite like it~ but it really only comes out when I'm rapping multipitch routes,1
3967,I know I could have made something that would work similarly for far cheaper~ but I like to make it rain for the climbing gear companies,1
3968,C.R.E.A.M.,1
3969,I have one~ cool device~ easy to use~ works as advertised,1
3970,Its not the cheapest or lightest option out there,1
3971,It's also not perfect for all situations,1
3972,My wife loves it for cleaning sport routes,1
3973,I use it when guiding.,1
3974,I have the dual version of the connect adjust~ which has a fixed end and an adjustable end,1
3975,A few notes: Overall~ the device has some tradeoffs versus the alternatives I have tried~ but I think I prefer it over a Prusik anchor or a PAS,1
3976,I haven't tried the Kong Slyde~ and it seems like that might mitigate some of the problems with the dual connect adjust~ so I might give it a try this summer.,1
3977,I enjoyed using the petzl adjust rapping from middle cathedral it was easy to use~ and makes for efficiency at bolted belays/rap anchors,1
3978,Still using this thing as my main personal anchor,1
3979,Still like it,1
3980,Works great,1
3981,I've noticed more and more people at the crag using these too,1
3982,But I guess the experts on MP have the final word...,1
3983,I started using this as my personal anchor and I love it,1
3984,It's handy and it is like how you can change the lengh with ease,1
3985,It was a bit pricey but I don't think you can put a price on your life~ I trust it...,1
3986," I have the ""dual connect adjust""",1
3987,After a brief testing period~ I decided to chop off the short end designed for rappel device extension,1
3988," This modification makes it essentially the same as the ""connect adjust"" I find that creating an extended rappel by clove hitching my belay device carabiner into the long strand (with slider) is more than adequate",1
3989," I felt that the additional bulk of the second short strand and the need to keep it clipped into a carabiner on my gear loop made the ""dual"" significantly worse than the connect adjust",1
3990,I would have preferred that Petzl use a smaller diameter cord for the connect adjust~ as the rope currently being used seems unneccisarily bulky,1
3991,I would be interested in using the aluminum slider on skinnier 7mm - 8mm cord,1
3992,Has anyone tried using the aluminum slider on skinnier cord?,1
3993,Has anyone tried using the aluminum slider on skinnier cord? I would be very interested in hearing about this as well,1
3994,I don't really want to tear mine apart but using it with some 8mm rope would be much less bulky and that would solve my biggest issue with it.,1
3995,I use a petzl adjust as part of my shooting rig~ works great for quick and bomber positioning when I need to get out of the way of the climber (ie tensioning over on a piece),1
3996,Can be tricky to unload~ but you get used to it after a while - and I really dig how quick and non-fumbly it is to work with,1
3997,However I really don't use while climbing~ I prefer double length slings for my personal anchor because of the bulk/versatility factor,1
3998,Many folks I know do use them for anchors and do dig them,1
3999,Recently had a chance to try the Connect with smaller diameter cords and found that 8mm to be about the smallest you would want to use,1
4000,Any smaller and they would slowly slide through the device depending on the diameter,1
4001,You could use smaller but would have to tie a stopper knot behind the device,1
4002,Also found that smaller diameter carabiners worked better than fat round ones.,1

4012,Did you cut the factory rope out and install your own?  If so did you just end up harvesting the aluminum connect piece and then tying knots in the end similar to the Kong Slyder?,1
4013,Can you use this to extend your rappel?,1
4014,Can you use this to extend your rappel?  Yes~ this is where it really excels IMHO,1
4015,Tie an alpine butterfly in the middle of the single connect adjust (or use the fixed-length tail of the dual connect adjust) for the extension while keeping the adjustable end clipped into your anchor,1
4016,Then adjust the length of the connect adjust so that your weight is on the rappel system to test the rappel system,1
4017,Then unclip from the anchor and rappel,1
4018,This system allows you to cleanly transition into weighting the rappel without unclipping from the anchor~ and it's very fast and easy to use.,1
4019,Yes~ this is where it really excels IMHO,1

4025,Great response,1
4026,I'm gonna pick one up to replace my daisy chain style pas!,1
4027,Yeah~ Oxford commas! Chicago style,1
4028,Chris Walden~ I did take it off of the short rope as I bought it for tree climbing but it isn't suited for that,1
4029,I pulled the stitches not cut~ because I was researching how many stitches~ what material and what breakstregth of the thread was used by Petzl~ in order to hand sew eyes.,1
4030,Chris Walden~ I did take it off of the short rope as I bought it for tree climbing but it isn't suited for that,1
4031,I pulled the stitches not cut~ because I was researching how many stitches~ what material and what breakstregth of the thread was used by Petzl~ in order to hand sew eyes,1
4032,Obligatory: yer gonna die,1
4033,Explanation: I researched sewing soft goods and concluded it takes a non-trivial amount of research and testing to do it safely,1
4034,Two surprising complexities I came across are 1) specialized needles are needed~ otherwise you may damage the fibers you're sewing into with the needle and 2) even if you get the sewing thread strong enough~ you have to make sure that it's compatible with the fibers you're sewing into; if you sew with i.e,1
4035,kevlar into nylon~ the kevlar will abrade the nylon and tear out,1
4036,Other things I wasn't able to find a clear answer on: 1) Do you need a speacialized sewing machine to not damage the material you're sewing into? 2) Does the shape (not material) of the thread matter? In the end I concluded that I don't even know enough to know what I don't know~ and what I don't know might hurt me~ so I decided not to go down this path,1
4037,If I were to try to learn to sew soft goods I'd want to learn it from an expert,1
4038,What risks you take are your prerogative~ I'm just informing you of risks you might not know about,1
4039,:),1
4040,Thanks David~ the needle has to have a ball tip~ rounded~ to slide between fibers rather than cutting through,1
4041,The Petzl Contact has dyneema tread at about 35# breaking strength~ I use 80# dyneema fishing line,1
4042,I don't think there is enough movement after being sewn for the fibers to wear on each other,1
4043,After being sewn it is like a rock~ with very little ability to even flex it,1
4044,You do need a special machine if that is the route you go~ but I am sewing mine by hand,1
4045,All the tread Ihave seen used has been braided~ not mono~ so under load they would tend to be round,1
4046,I have had some tested and they all broke high enough to be considered safe for life support,1
4047,They all broke where the stitches start~ so now I doing a combination of a short bury splice and sewing combined to try to increase the break strength,1
4048,I have been using them for a couple of years now with no problems.,1

4058,My apologies then~ it appears you've done a lot more research on this than I have,1
4059,I'm interested in pictures of what you're doing,1
4060,What cord are you using?,1
4061,I mostly aid climb and on walls I love the evolv adjusts as tethers for my alders and as anchor point~ however when I lead I keep them fully extended and use my al-free-fi (an Yates adjustable with a Fifi hook welded on to it) as a floating adjustable daisy~ adjusting the length on the adjusts is time consuming and a cluster fuck~ the free fi solves that,1
4062,But for steep or traversing ground I have the option to first cintch up the adjust while I simultaneously lower my self off of the free fi,1
4063,The added benefit of the evolv adjusts to is because of the dynamic cord daisy falls aren't as bad,1
4064,Anybody using the Spirit SL with the connect adjust as petzl recommends? I've had two Spirits jam closed on me to the point where no amount of bouncing/twisting~ hitting/banging~ or improvised grab (i.e,1
4065,Girth hitched cord) could open the screwlock,1
4066,In both cases the only thing that opened the biners was a wrench,1
4067,First time it happened I was luckily clipped to MY anchor rig and was thus able to I clip the rig and I jam the spirit when safely back home,1
4068,The second time I was clipped direct to a bolt and had to cut my way free (sad face.)  I was lucky enough to be able to get my gear back after the fact by returning with~ you guessed it~ a wrench,1
4069,Now I know jammed lockers is a thing~ I'm just a little frustrated to have it happen twice with two different biners of the same model,1
4070,Never had this issue with any of my other lockers over the years~ and now twice in under nine months,1

4077,Never had this issue with any of my other lockers over the years~ and now twice in under nine months,1
4078,I'm using the Spirit SL for this (and most of my rack where non-HMS lockers are required),1
4079,I've found that the screwlock sometimes sticks when they're weighted~ but unweighting seems to fix the issue,1
4080,This can definitely be inconvenient to do in some situations,1
4081,It's never been so hard I had to use a wrench~ though.,1
4082,Andy Kirkpatrick has this to say about locker jam: Collar lock down is caused by the tightening of the collar while under load (perhaps tightened on an abseil when still hanging form the rope),1
4083,Once unloaded the collar will jam~ and can only be unscrewed while loaded,1
4084,In a self rescue situation this could prove very serious~ and otherwise it’s just annoying!,1
4085,No problem~ David,1
4086,I was glad to get my first Yer Gonna Die on here!  There is a tread on Treebuzz~ in the Splice Rack section~titled Documenting My Hand Sewn Eyes~ that is a good place to look if you are interested,1
4087,The the guy who posted it~ Moss~ explains how he does it and gives sources for thread and needles,1
4088,It got me started~ but I use a different method now,1
4089,I need to make~ and test some bury and sewn cords to see how they compare to just sewing~ but I'm now playing around with soft shackles~ which brings us back to the original subject,1
4090,I've replaced the carabiner that goes through the Adjust with  dyneema core~ technora cover soft shackle,1
4091,I'm using it with 8mm cord~ but tried 5mm tech cord and it worked also.,1
4092,No~ this is not true,1
4093,"You can get inches from the anchor if you want by clipping a second biner into the end loop~ and then to your belay loop: your action for closing the distance is to ""extend"" the prusik~ making the end loop smaller.",1
4094,Has anyone investigated using the connect adjust for the following applications (that 120cm slings are traditionally used for): 1,1
4095,Extending lead gear placements 2,1
4096,"""Slinging"" trees~ horns~ chicken heads~ pillars~ trees~ etc",1
4097,Connecting and equalizing multiple pieces for multi-pitch belay anchors Petzl does not appear to endorse or warn against the use of the connect adjust for these applications,1
4098,At first glance~ it seem to me that the following certifications (petzl.com/US/en/Sport/CONNE…) would be sufficient for the applications mentioned above,1
4099,- static strength > 15 kN (I realize that this is less than the minimum strength required for certified sewn slings~ but my understanding is that it would be highly unlikely for any of these applications to result in loads exceeding 15kN~ since the maximum force measured in a factor 2 fall~ with an 80 kg mass~ was 6.2 kN) - static slippage > 4 kN (Seems irrelevant for the applications listed above) - dynamic test: 5 falls of factor 2~ 80 kg mass~ adjustable arm set to 80 % of the maximum length (above and beyond what is required for slings) Note that my intention is to investigate using a connect adjust~ in lieu of my seldomly used double length sling~ for these applications,1
4100,I always carry a hollow block and a long cordallete~ when I may need to make friction hitches~ so loosing the friction hitch functionality of a double length sling is not a big deal for me,1
4101,And yes..,1
4102,I do realize that the connect adjust is significnatly heavier and bulkier than a 120cm sling,1
4103,Has anyone investigated using the connect adjust for the following applications (that 120cm slings are traditionally used for): 1,1
4104,Extending lead gear placements 2,1
4105,"""Slinging"" trees~ horns~ chicken heads~ pillars~ trees~ etc",1
4106,Connecting and equalizing multiple pieces for multi-pitch belay anchors Petzl does not appear to endorse or warn against the use of the connect adjust for these applications,1
4107,At first glance~ it seem to me that the following certifications (petzl.com/US/en/Sport/CONNE…) would be sufficient for the applications mentioned above,1
4108,- static strength > 15 kN (I realize that this is less than the minimum strength required for certified sewn slings~ but my understanding is that it would be highly unlikely for any of these applications to result in loads exceeding 15kN~ since the maximum force measured in a factor 2 fall~ with an 80 kg mass~ was 6.2 kN) - static slippage > 4 kN (Seems irrelevant for the applications listed above) - dynamic test: 5 falls of factor 2~ 80 kg mass~ adjustable arm set to 80 % of the maximum length (above and beyond what is required for slings) Note that my intention is to investigate using a connect adjust~ in lieu of my seldomly used double length sling~ for these applications,1
4109,I always carry a hollow block and a long cordallete~ when I may need to make friction hitches~ so loosing the friction hitch functionality of a double length sling is not a big deal for me,1
4110,And yes..,1
4111,I do realize that the connect adjust is significnatly heavier and bulkier than a 120cm sling,1
4112,It could work for such applications but the real question is why you even want to,1
4113,A double length sling will work better for all these application so what's the appeal of using the connect adjust instead?,1
4114,For what it is worth.,1
4115,you can also use a Gigi or similar type device the same way as the Slyde,1
4116,However~ something thicker than the cord I used for example would be better :),1
4117,Everytime I see the slyde - which I've never used~ I think back to Kong's smaller aid product with the same idea but a hook instead of a carabiner hole - https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/climbing/climbing-hooks/kong-resting-fiffi Used it with 6mm (out of spec!) to get a smoother slide (but it still wasn't terribly smooth),1
4118,But~ every now and again the two strands in the long slot would invert~ and I'd fall back until I hit my stopper knot,1
4119,Scared the shit out of me the first time it happened! No idea what the slyde is like~ but yeah...I'd make sure that stopper knot was solid.,1
4120,It could work for such applications but the real question is why you even want to,1
4121,A double length sling will work better for all these application so what's the appeal of using the connect adjust instead? The appeal is for routes where there is a 100% chance of awkward / hanging rappel stations and <10% chance of needing a sling longer than a 60cm on the way up,1
4122,Take Crimson Chrysalis~ as an example.,1
4123,The appeal is for routes where there is a 100% chance of awkward / hanging rappel stations and <10% chance of needing a sling longer than a 60cm on the way up,1

4125,That's the appeal of the connect adjust for its intended application~ but Eli is responding to a post about using the connect adjust to do stuff it wasn't intended for.,1

4127,You seem confused,1
4128,You seem confused,1
4129,The post in question.,1
4130,The post in question,1
4131,Wow~ really doubling down with that confusion,1
4132,No~ this is not true,1
4133,"You can get inches from the anchor if you want by clipping a second biner into the end loop~ and then to your belay loop: your action for closing the distance is to ""extend"" the prusik~ making the end loop smaller",1
4134,Just seems like more shit to carry and more work to accomplish the same thing,1
4135,If I can avoid fumbling about with additional carabiners and clipping this loop to that loop to my harness and tying knots and shit~ great,1
4136,This thread is a few years old now,1
4137,I've been using the Connect Adjust in that time and it works great,1
4138,No problems with it,1
4139,It takes up basically zero room on my harness and it gets the job done,1
4140,It's quick,1
4141,It's simple,1
4142,And it's reliable,1
4143,Some people prefer the typical Metolius PAS with all the loops,1
4144,I prefer the Petzl,1
4145,I'm not here to convince people to use it~ but it works for me.,1

4157,I'm not here to convince people to use it~ but it works for me,1
4158,I agree,1
4159,I like mine a lot,1
4160,Sometimes~ I only use the rope,1
4161,Other times~ I take slings and cord~ as well as my PAS,1
4162,It all depends on the route and who I am climbing with,1
4163,There is more than one way to skin a cat~ and if it works for you~ great.,1
4164,Yes~ this is where it really excels IMHO,1
4165,Tie an alpine butterfly in the middle of the single connect adjust (or use the fixed-length tail of the dual connect adjust) for the extension while keeping the adjustable end clipped into your anchor,1
4166,Then adjust the length of the connect adjust so that your weight is on the rappel system to test the rappel system,1
4167,Then unclip from the anchor and rappel,1
4168,This system allows you to cleanly transition into weighting the rappel without unclipping from the anchor~ and it's very fast and easy to use,1
4169,I agree with you,1
4170,I picked up a dual on the cheap~ and I am glad that I did,1
4171,It really makes multi pitch rappels effortless,1
4172,It is a bit bulky~ but I configure the 2 pieces in a way that keeps them close to my body so they don't interfere with anything while climbing,1
4173,It isn't for everyone~ but I like having it on my harness,1
4174,We all have our own preferences and methods don't we?,1
4175,Anybody using the Spirit SL with the connect adjust as petzl recommends? I've had two Spirits jam closed on me to the point where no amount of bouncing/twisting~ hitting/banging~ or improvised grab (i.e,1
4176,Girth hitched cord) could open the screwlock,1
4177,In both cases the only thing that opened the biners was a wrench,1
4178,First time it happened I was luckily clipped to MY anchor rig and was thus able to I clip the rig and I jam the spirit when safely back home,1
4179,The second time I was clipped direct to a bolt and had to cut my way free (sad face.)  I was lucky enough to be able to get my gear back after the fact by returning with~ you guessed it~ a wrench,1
4180,Now I know jammed lockers is a thing~ I'm just a little frustrated to have it happen twice with two different biners of the same model,1
4181,Never had this issue with any of my other lockers over the years~ and now twice in under nine months,1
4182,I use the recommended caribiners that you mentioned~ and I haven't had any problems with them,1
4183,I did have a Petzl Attache biner lock up once~ and I also had to use a multitool to unlock it.,1
4184,I use this with the Connect Adjust,1
4185,One-handed operation both clipping and unclipping~ can't forget to lock it~ accidental rubbing on things doesn't unlock it~ and of course it can't bind shut.,1
4186,I've not had any problems with the Petzl Spirit locker,1
4187,They are really the only lockers I use now,1
4188,They are small~ really light~ and plenty strong,1
4189,It would be cool if they offered them with a twist lock instead of screw lock~ though.,1
4190,Does it fit through smaller chains or old hangers with a small opening? I have the model with wires for both gates and the wire is wide enough that it’s been troublesome a few times,1
4191,I've very occasionally found some anchors it doesn't fit in---had to thread a sling for those,1
4192,Not frequent enough to be an issue in the places I've climbed.,1
4193,Yeah I have one and love it! I use the long adjustable end for anchoring and the short fixed for extended rappels,1
4194,Works amazing,1
4195,Petzl makes an adjustable bridge for arborists harnesses that uses the Adjust~ and the sewn eyes are coming loose,1
4196,The stitches should be straight up and down like the top eye in the picture,1
4197,The bottom eye is the defective one,1
4198,The stitches were so loose~ the owner was able to shift the stitches in the opposite direction~ resulting in a gap between the two sections of rope.,1
4199,First: Different type of rope and with less stitching,1
4200,"And the ""climbing"" version has additional material at the stitched ends as well",1
4201,Second: If you look at the literature for the arborist and industrial versions~ they specifically state they are not intended for climbing,1
4202,With the climbing versions~ you aren't putting a carabiner through the stitched eyes either..,1
4203,unless it's the end for extending a rappel,1
4204,Most of the force is on the middle of the rope somewhere~ not the end,1
4205,Except for the part that's girth hitched to your harness belay loop which again~ has a slightly different design to the one in your photo,1
4206,And with the dual connect adjust~ the end that is used for extending a rappel..,1
4207,it's much larger and reinforced with a sheath,1
4208,The adjustable bridge is a very different design than any of the climbing-specific versions~ which have longer tails on the eyelets~ with more stitching~ plus additional reinforcements.,1
4209,The girth hitch loop stitching is where you might have a problem,1
4210,When loaded the loop~ and eyes on the bridge~ are trying to be forced apart~ no matter how they are being used,1
4211,Not sure where you're going with the load only being in the middle of the rope~ but that loop will see the full load~ after any stretching is done,1
4212,I'm guessing they are the same rope only different colors,1
4213,The plastic covers are only to protect the stitching~ no added strength.,1
4214,Look at the Petzl Connect Adjust,1
4215,The one used for rock climbing,1
4216,The one this thread is about,1
4217,There are no eyes being loaded on that product like there are on the bridge you are referencing,1
4218,One end has a sewn loop used to girth hitch your harness,1
4219,The other end bears no load,1
4220,It's just doubled over and stitched so it doesn't pull through the device,1
4221,And the end that is sewn into a loop and girth hitched is more substantive than the bridge product you're talking about—which has a smaller eye through which a carabiner is attached,1
4222,When the climbing versions are girth hitched to one's belay loop—as intended—it definitely loads the stitching differently compared to someone putting a carabiner through the open loop~ which wants to pull the stitching apart,1
4223,The Connect Adjust is not supposed to be used that way,1
4224,The forces on the loop or eye are the same,1
4225,Each half of the loop or the eye receives half the load,1
4226,There isn't a pulley type of action on the eye around the carabiner~ because the bend radius is too small to allow for that,1
4227,The bridge stitching might be shorter because when used as a bridge~ the eyes share the load,1
4228,The Connect lanyard loops receive the full load,1
4229,All these products are made by Petzl~ have sewn circular connections~ and are loaded similarly enough that I thought I would warn others of the possibility of failure,1
4230,If the stitches start to slant~ or you can move the two parts of the loop in opposite directions at the stitches~ you might have a problem.,1
4231,The Connect Adjust can also be tied with a Blake's Hitch~ and used to ascend the rope in self rescue situations,1
4232,Yeah well ..,1
4233,I tried the single-strand blake's hitch quite extensively as a personal safety with adjustable length a few years back~ on various hitch and rope strand diameters~ but getting the hitch and rope diameters to be remotely friendly for further adjustment after full bodyweight loading turned out to be very problematic,1
4234,Double the adjustment range vs a Purcell prussik for sure~ but not very suitable for an adjustable hanging belay at all.,1
4235,Looks like CAMP is jumping in on the game~ I like the little tab on the device that allows a easier lower,1
4236,Yeah well ..,1
4237,I tried the single-strand blake's hitch quite extensively as a personal safety with adjustable length a few years back~ on various hitch and rope strand diameters~ but getting the hitch and rope diameters to be remotely friendly for further adjustment after full bodyweight loading turned out to be very problematic,1
4238,Double the adjustment range vs a Purcell prussik for sure~ but not very suitable for an adjustable hanging belay at all,1
4239,The Blake’s Hitch works best when the hitch and rope it is tied to are the same diameter,1
4240,Most other hitches are better when the hitch cord is slightly smaller than the rope.,1
4241,Looks like an ATC in guide mode~ just as a single tube instead of the typical dual tube device for belaying/rappelling,1
4242,"Climber's side of the rope pinches the ""brake"" side and auto locks just like an ATC or Reverso in guide mode.",1
4243,There is also a small v groove that the brake section gets pushed into,1
4244,It does release under load~ even full~ hanging body weight,1
4245,Unlike the Petzl Adjust~ this device can’t be clipped to the harness to use with a longer rope,1
4246,The Blake’s Hitch works best when the hitch and rope it is tied to are the same diameter,1
4247,Most other hitches are better when the hitch cord is slightly smaller than the rope,1
4248,For my usage as a fully adjustable tether it was always tied to itself,1
4249,8.5mm dynamic locked up too tight~ might have another go with a length of 9.8mm Sterling Evolution cutoff~ more sheath~ lower stretch.,1
4250,There's not much tech on Kong's website for the Slyde,1
4251,Does anyone know what range of rope diameters it is designed for?,1
4252,9-10mm dynamic single ropes,1
4253,I use it with a 9.2mm moderately stiff Tendon rope,1
4254,It can be difficult at times to adjust,1
4255," Also tried the Slyde with an old Beal ""Verdon"" 9mm half-rope that isn't the slightest bit stiff",1
4256,It adjusted much more easily,1
4257,My conclusion is that the Slyde works best with non-stiff ropes.,1
4258,Yeah well ..,1
4259,I tried the single-strand blake's hitch quite extensively as a personal safety with adjustable length a few years back~ on various hitch and rope strand diameters~ but getting the hitch and rope diameters to be remotely friendly for further adjustment after full bodyweight loading turned out to be very problematic,1
4260,Double the adjustment range vs a Purcell prussik for sure~ but not very suitable for an adjustable hanging belay at all,1
4261,After rereading this post~ it seems you’re using a fixed rope for the lanyard and using a separate cord for the hitch?  If so~ there are many two legged hitches that work better than the single Blake’s.,1
4262,$5 shipped for something that costs $10 plus dude cuts his own rope? Take'em up on the offer to get a gigi half off then use the rope for a dog leash after you find out that the MYOG contraption doesn't get you as close to your gear as the adjust and that the extending of the device isn't as easily done one-handed with a gigi,1
4263,Lol,1
4264,You probably will get just as close if the Gigi is attached to the harness~ instead of to the carabiner clipped to the anchor~ this is how I use my Adjust.,1
4265,Slots on the Gigi are much wider than that on the Slyde~ I wouldn't use a tether w/ Gigi as your only point of attachment edit: unless you are using a hella fat rope,1
4266,After rereading this post~ it seems you’re using a fixed rope for the lanyard and using a separate cord for the hitch?  If so~ there are many two legged hitches that work better than the single Blake’s,1
4267,I was using a single strand~ all the same diameter~ with a figure 8 on a bight at midway (ish) girth-hitched to the harness tie-in~ then the tail from that forming a blake's hitch back onto to the main strand,1
4268,Main strand had the anchor biner on it attached via a strangle or similar suitable knot,1
4269,The idea being similar to a purcell prussik but adjustable from full length to very short~ instead of full length to half length (purcell).,1
4270,I'm too young (at heart lol) for the old dad's thread,1
4271,You're a few years too late,1
4272,Look at the freakin' date on threads before you try to be smooth.,1
4273,I agree,1
4274,I use a connect adjust for aid and when I am at a belay when free climbing I just clove hitch the rope to the anchor,1
4275,Yeah....I know..,1
4276,I'm a little late in the conversation..,1
4277,almost exactly 3 years late..,1
4278,but hey....I was looking at daisy chains and other PAS systems when I stumbled upon this thing,1
4279,Have to say...it was a little  pricey in my view~ but found a flash sale and picked it up for $29.00,1
4280,After reviewing various alternatives~  this  made the most sense for me,1
4281,I wanted to be able to have the ability for an extended rappel set up and a quick and easy way to connect to an anchor while possibly having to do it with one hand,1
4282,Sometimes in ice climbing there may not be the option to have both hands free to clip into the anchor as one hand may be holding onto the ice tool set into the ice....this thing just might do the trick...right now...I'm  clipped into my basement ceiling~ but in a few weeks it's going outside for a test drive....yeah...I know ...blurry photo...bad lighting and an empty wine rack...and a prusik used to pull the DMM pivot to demonstrate the extended rappel while clipped into the master point...yes...not ideal~ but you get the point,1
4283,If there's anything I've gathered from this thread~ it is that you do indeed feel the need to convince people.,1

4298,At least try..,1
4299,That would be helpful..,1

4314,At least try..,1
4315,That would be helpful..,1
4316,But THIS post OTOH really clarifies the pros and cons of personal tether systems and the Petzl item in particular,1
4317,/s,1
4318,So that's with the single connect adjust right? Nice idea~ how are you gonna get that clove hitch in if the thing is under tension? Yes~ I only have the single..,1
4319,(The Price was right)....If it were under tension..,1
4320,I'd say it isn't going to happen...,1
4321,That's why I attach a binder with a clove hitch~ then clip into the harness loop before the start of the climb..,1
4322,When needed~ just unclip from harness ( maybe need to dress the clove hitch a little) then clip to anchor.,1
4323,Yes~ I only have the single..,1
4324,(The Price was right)....If it were under tension..,1
4325,I'd say it isn't going to happen...,1
4326,That's why I attach a binder with a clove hitch~ then clip into the harness loop before the start of the climb..,1
4327,When needed~ just unclip from harness ( maybe need to dress the clove hitch a little) then clip to anchor,1
4328,Not a great shot..,1
4329,But you can see (2) DMM Rhino screw gates,1
4330,The one in the middle is clove hitched before the climb..,1
4331,The photos makes it look like it's clove hitched to my leg loop...lol...it's not,1
4332,So that's with the single connect adjust right? Nice idea~ how are you gonna get that clove hitch in if the thing is under tension? Crank the PA up and clip into the anchor with a quickdraw,1
4333,Hanging from the draw~ loosen the PA and clove rap biner to it,1
4334,Crank the PA back up~ hang from it and and unclip the draw,1
4335,Loosen the PA to the desired comfort level.,1
4336,I usually prefer to use a separate 60cm sling (basket hitched to harness) to extend my rappel device~ when using the connect adjust as a PAS for rappelling,1
4337,I used to clove hitch my rappel device to the Connect Adjust~ but I find it often makes the PAS too short,1
4338,With the separate basket hitched sling for rappel extension~ there are no weighted knots or clove hitches to deal with~ after rappelling.P.S,1
4339,These days~ I prefer to use the 150cm Beal Dynamic Sling for a multi-pitch Rappel PAS and rappel extension over the connect adjust,1
4340,IMO~ it is easier to rack and carry and it has more uses on the way up,1
4341,True that it does feel a bit short when you clove hitch a rappel device to the single connect..,1
4342,still gets the job done...but there are concession,1
4343,I'm curious about the double connect designed for that purpose..,1
4344,But then you get more bulk..,1
4345,"Clearly every option has its ""pro's and con's""....I haven't decided if this piece of pro is more of a gimmick or more of a highly useful ease of use type of gear..",1
4346,Just need to get out and give it a test drive..,1
4347,"But I do love the concept..I don't think it's a "" must have"" rather it's more of a ""nice to have""...I would not have paid $50.00 for it...I got mine for $29.00 which is probably the better price point.",1
4348,Here’s how I’ve found the connect adjust most useful,1
4349,Rappels: clip into the most solid bolt,1
4350,If both bolts are sketchy~ I clip a quick draw to both bolts while setting up the rap,1
4351,It’s quick and redundant,1
4352,I rarely extend my rappels bc most of the time I find it unnecessary,1
4353,I’ve tried cloving a locker to extend the rappel~ but deemed it annoying and unnecessary,1
4354,Sport climbing: instead of stick clipping through sections where I can’t do the moves~ I can usually extend my connect adjust to pull through the section,1
4355,Of course this doesn’t work all the time~ but’s it’s really nice to have when the situation fits the bill,1
4356,Trad climbing: I like to French free sections with the connect adjust,1
4357,It makes back cleaning painless and feels much better to hang on than a girth hitched sling,1
4358,For trad anchors~ it’s really nice to clip directly into the first piece because it’s so easy to remove after building the anchor,1
4359,It gives you tons of flexibility for moving around,1
4360,Most of the haters rip on the connect adjust without trying it,1
4361,For me~ it’s been a huge factor in making belays and rappels more comfortable,1
4362,I would highly recommend it,1
4363,* I also found that clipping the connect adjust between your legs and onto the back gear loop to be the easiest way to keep things out of the way,1
4364,I tried this on my harness  yesterday in my basement..,1
4365,good to know it's an option on the climb...thanks for posting,1
4366,I really like the Connect Adjust~ like said earlier you are paying for the convince,1
4367,Question that I either missed~ or didn't see answered: How easy is it to lengthen the adjustable side of the Petzl Connect while under body weight load?  That Camp looked smooth~ and I'm wondering if the Petzl is similarly easy to lengthen while under load.,1
4368,The Camp device---at least the first ones to reach the stores---is signifcantly worse than the Petzl,1
4369,The slot is too tight for the cord and operation is strenuous,1
4370,Maybe I saw an early model~ but the one I saw is inferior,1
4371,I can't imagine that they won't fix this~ but for now I'd only buy one if you can go to a store and test it out.,1
4372,The camp swing is only worth getting if you're willing to cut to rope off it and replace it with a thinner cord (it comes with 9.7mm or so cord and it needs a 8.9-9.2mm cord to actually work properly) additionally if using it as an aid tether~ the rope it comes with is much too short,1
4373,One other point is that the swing is def  not smooth when lengthening it under load as it doesn't have any gradual setting for how fast it lets rope through the device and will go from locked to wide open with no space inbetween the two.,1
4374,Seriously...this is what you spend your time on???...,1
4375,I've read the entire thread (yes..all 3 years...lol)...because I wanted to learn about the different perspectives regarding this piece of pro...,1
4376,There were some pretty informative comments and some...a complete waste of time...guess which category your comment falls into..,1
4377,I'm not an English major~ but I've certainly had the opportunity to study language and the art of linguistics enough to be able to determine that FourT6and2 (OP) was nothing more than his experience and support of this pro..,1
4378,Not an all out affirmation that you're going to burn in hell if you don't buy this piece of gear...,1
4379,The OP  and pursuant dialogue that followed was for the most part...useful....which (along with others informative comments) was quite helpful and appreciated..,1
4380,Playing armchair psychiatrist clearly isn't your specialty as you on the other hand offered what exactly????..,1
4381,I'll save you the trouble of even have to think about the possibility of formulating something that would probably not even come close to resembling an intelligent response by answering question for you...,1
4382,You offered a useless opinion based on nothing..,1
4383,No photo~ no hometown listed..,1
4384,Not even a reasonably semi- intelligent response...I suspect you reside in the dark shadows of the troll farmland just waiting to spring out of the mental masterbation that you spend your time wallowing in ..,1
4385,Kind of like a pig in mud really..,1
4386,So~ perhaps next time~  you might be able to conjure up the fortitude of at least engaging 2 or more functioning brain cells to offer a useful~ informative and productive commentary about the subject matter..,1
4387,At least try..,1
4388,That would be helpful..,1
4389,Trust me~ the fact that you're not an English major is apparent,1
4390,I feel sorry for the period button on your keyboard.,1
4391,I wrote up my initial impressions on the gear discussion page,1
4392,Today I put the Merlins through the paces tonight at the gym,1
4393,For reference~ I've climbed for 30 years,1
4394,Never harder than mid 12s,1
4395,I've used a lot of shoes and watched the evolution of shoes over that time,1
4396,I still have a pair of Sportiva Megas in the closet,1
4397,So I'm not new to evaluating a shoe within the grades that I climb,1
4398,For sizing I went with my shoe street shoe size of 11.5,1
4399,I wear medium thin running socks and the fit was glove tight,1
4400,Zero break in for my flat wide feet,1
4401,Comfortable from the get go,1
4402,If I wanted a bit more performance is have sized down 1/2,1
4403,I only climb to 11d so I don't see any need for stupid tight shoes,1
4404,Just not necessary at that grade,1
4405,The Good:Tonight I tried to use every variety of foot holds I could find and some heel hooking as well,1
4406,The first thing I confirmed were my initial thoughts on the rubber,1
4407,It's fantastic stuff,1
4408,Not quite as hard as XS Edge~ not as soft as XS Grip,1
4409,Those are the two I'm currently climbing with on my Tenaya Iatis~ Scarpa Helix~ Miura lace and Mythos,1
4410,But by far it feels grippier than the XS Grip rubber,1
4411,Likely grippier than the XS Grip,1
4412,I picked some greasy slick holds that I know Edge rubber would have greased off on,1
4413,This stuff stuck like a mouse on a glue trap,1
4414,Once locked on I could push off with confidence,1
4415,No rolling on tiny edges,1
4416,It's a middle ground as far as hardness with all the grip of a softer rubber,1
4417,I have never used Stealth rubber so I can't compare it to that,1
4418,Comfort,1
4419,I would normally break a shoe in over a week or so before I'm comfortable with it,1
4420,These were comfortable on the first climb I did,1
4421,The Tenaya was my other gold standard for out of the box comfort,1
4422,These rival the Tenaya,1
4423,Sensitivity,1
4424,I can't really speak to super sensitive shoes as I've never worn them,1
4425,The Mythos and Tenaya Iati are the most sensitive shoe I've worn so far,1
4426,I've never liked super thin shoes,1
4427,The Merlin is not a super sensitive shoe,1
4428,The rubber appears to be around 5mm on the forefoot,1
4429,The rand is also thicker than other shoes I've used,1
4430,Suffice to say these are built strong and you won't be blowing out toes or rands anytime soon,1
4431,I'm guessing these will likely go double the lifespan of my Tenayas,1
4432,At the loss of some sensitivity,1
4433,I never felt like I couldn't pinpoint toe placement on tiny chips,1
4434,I was always aware of where my toe was,1
4435,But the rubber is thick,1
4436,For me that's a bonus,1
4437,I'm not bouldering,1
4438,I climb sandstone face climbs~ overhung blocky sandstone~ and crystally granite,1
4439,I think these will excel in that arena,1
4440,They are edging machines,1
4441,As for smearing~ they'll do the job but we all~ know there are better shoes for the job than a downturned shoe like this,1
4442,For heel hooking they are fantastic,1
4443,Far better than my Tenayas,1
4444,The rand rubber in the heel is thick and fully surrounds the heel,1
4445,The toe is small enough to fit in pockets,1
4446,Not the smallest/pointiest~ but then again this shoe is built on a slightly wider last than the Spectre.If you like the Miura~ but want less pain because you have a wider foot~ and want more downturn and stickier rubber~ this shoe fits well in that place,1
4447,The Bad: Cost,1
4448,The shoe is priced up there with higher end Sportivas,1
4449,Is that necessarily a bad thing? No,1
4450,Given how well these shoes are constructed~ you'll likely get twice the lifespan than other similar shoes before needing a resole and the rand is going to last a long time,1
4451,So yes you'll pay more initially but you'll get excellent value for your money,1
4452,Should Acopa offer a more value priced shoe to go along with these? Yes,1
4453,Hopefully that will come,1
4454,Rubber thickness,1
4455,Again~ this isn't necessarily a bad thing,1
4456,But in a market full of 3mm rubber~ the sole thickness may come as a surprised to some,1
4457,I really can't say much more about these,1
4458,I feel I can be honest about them because I paid for them,1
4459,They were not given to me to do this review although I did receive a small discount for getting in the game very early.Just as with Jon and his review on the Spectres~ I can offer a discount code for 15% off your first order,1
4460,LZ16REF,1
4461,No I don't make a percentage on shoes sold under that code,1
4462,I'm simply stoked to see a climber owned company putting out a nice product and happy to help get the word out,1
4463,These shoes are not for everyone,1
4464,But if the shoe fits as they say~ they are a helluva climbing machine,1
4465,I'll do another review after I get some time in and make a trip up to Chattanooga on some sandstone and Enchanted Rock for some granite crystal pulling,1
4466,My first pair of Acrux ARs were purchased last November and by the end of ice season (March with about 40 to 50 days on ice)~ they looked like this,1
4467,I’ve had a pair of Acrux AR’s for almost two years now and have not experienced this at all,1
4468,Hundreds of KM on rock/approach as well as on snow and ice~ and my boots are looking quite good,1
4469,I’d say the sole is much more durable than any other double boot I’ve used,1
4470,I have two small nicks in the rand from a crampon point~ but nothing like your photos.,1
4471,After a long wait~ I got a chance to squeeze the trigger on a couple DMM Dragonflies,1
4472,I didn't buy them,1
4473,In that size range~ I currently rack:,1
4474,I don’t know but I’ll take that purple c3 from ya if you’re not using it.,1
4475,I say whatever you feel the most confident placing and when placed you feel like its going to catch you,1
4476,It's like most gear~ find what works best for you,1
4477,No thanks,1
4478,Those BD 3CU are handy now and again,1
4479,I still rack those in special situations,1
4480,No thanks,1
4481,Those BD 3CU are handy now and again,1
4482,I still rack those in special situations,1
4483,What if I offered up that black totem I bootied?,1
4484,What if I offered up that black totem I bootied? Sweet offer,1
4485,What does it look like?  If not me maybe another hoarder will fill your ask.,1
4486,What if I offered up that black totem I bootied? For real? I have a purple C3 but I don't know if I could actually bring myself to get rid of it,1
4487,That's a great cam,1
4488,But so is the black totem...,1
4489,I picked up the tiniest one (green) to supplement the smallest end of my rack,1
4490,It feels a bit like a well made alien and a bit noodly~ sorta like the old tiny WC microcams although a bit less flimsy (first time I saw the smallest of those I honestly thought it was keychain toy - didn't help that it was adjacent to some tiny tricams that had been made into keychains),1
4491,Anyway I've placed it in a couple of spots where it tamed some previously spicy sections although honestly it's so small it's hard to feel like it's going to stop more than a foot slip,1
4492,I kind of prefer it to the smallest C3s because of its floppyness being more forgiving on rope movement maybe tending to walk it but I think the C3s might feel a tad stronger - a purely subjective feeling not based on the strength ratings,1
4493,Haven't fallen on it yet (and hope not to),1
4494,As I wear out my old aliens (picked up some old unused ones on ebay over the past 5-10yrs) I'll probably go with dragonflies,1
4495,I typically rack mastercams~ regular totems~ and supplement with CCH aliens and/or C4s,1
4496,The MCs are kinda burly and maybe will stand up better to abuse but I don't think they stick as well in finicky placements or  have as much bite - pretty much how I feel about their relationship with the aliens,1
4497,Lifes too short not to get the gear you want,1
4498,As privileged Americans~ we need to separate our NEEDS and out WANTS,1
4499,Then fulfill both (needs and wants),1
4500,"So~ based on the ""privileged American theory""~ you should buy a full set of Dragonflys~ if not 2.",1
4501,I grabbed a set (green to blue) as I only had singles in some of those sizes~ and nothing in the green Dragonfly size,1
4502,I marginally prefer them to my X4s and Aliens~ but I wouldn't rush out and buy them to replace something in that size,1
4503,Only to fill a hole in my rack.,1
4504,A great climber can use any brand of cam.,1
4505,And an even greater climber can do without cams~ or shoes~ and fills his chalk bag with ice cubes.,1
4506,The words of an A+ #1 dbag,1
4507,Get yourself a coors and climb on!!,1
4508,​Seriously though~ the little differences between most cams makes no difference.​​​ Follow your psych!,1
4509,The green is small :-),1
4510,HELL YEAH I alwasy do!!  What's a dragonflie?,1
4511,Bought a set and only kept the biggest one(purple similar to an orange metolius) and the two smallest ones(red and green) sold the other sizes after some sessions in eldo and some granite crags,1
4512,Pros and cons in my opinion Pros: flexible~dmm built~ extendable slings are nice (especially in eldo) fairly light~ metal bites real well,1
4513,Cons: the action gets a bit gritty fairly quick~ keep em clean and this isn't a problem,1
4514,Durability~ I get it they're a softer metal which helps em bite~ BUT I took a couple falls on the purple one and gouged a decent chunk out of it and the thumb loop plastic cracked/cut and the sling abrasied noticeably,1
4515,Said falls were at practice rock (bocan) on the 11b splitter (fairly rounded edges from what I recall) anywho I've whipped my brains out on totems and totem basics and they're still holding up way better,1
4516,That being said I'd still recommend the two smallest ones,1
4517,Hard to beat 6kn from a cam in those sizes,1
4518,I can upload a pic of the cam if you're interested in seeing it.,1
4519,Wow! First pic ive seen that really puts it in perspective,1
4520,Kinda sketchy even.,1
4521,Cool~ I'll upload a pic to this thread when I get home from work,1
4522,Said photos~ I still climb with this cam and believe it's still pretty darn safe~ but think its worth noting these cams may deform a bit easier then you'd like with minimal abuse,1
4523,Sling and loop damage after two falls~ again I still think the cam is safe for further use,1
4524,Just not as durable as a similar sized totem or master cam,1
4525,Hard to display in the photo but the crack went through the plastic to the metal wire,1
4526,The sling abrasion is minimal but again~ after two small falls.,1
4527,WC Friends with extendable slings are reputed to have the same issue and to suffer kinking in the cable after falls,1
4528,The extendable sling on a thumb loop is a questionable feature,1
4529,The fact that the loop tightens on the loop when pulled must diminish the anti-walk property of the extended sling on the cam,1
4530,And the damage to the thumb loop and sling caused by your fall~ make me wonder by how much the safe fall force has been reduced,1
4531,Still it looks like you took a good whip and the cam did it’s job,1
4532,Thank you,1
4533,I cut the extendo slings off all my cams that came that way I then get the reslung camalot style,1
4534,Keeps kinking to a minimum.,1
4535,From DMM ..,1
4536,the Totem and the Dragonfly use aluminium with the same harness,1
4537,From DMM ..,1
4538,the Totem and the Dragonfly use aluminium with the same harness Welp if that's the case~ I must be crazy,1
4539,I've used and abused my totems for far longer and they dont show wear as bad as on the dragonfly~ guess I can go back to practice rock and punt off with a totem in the same spot and see what happens,1
4540,Looks like the midweight parka to buy to me,1
4541,Doubt the Grade VII will do anything that much better other than save a couple of ounces and give the Backpacking Light reviewer a hard-on,1
4542,Glad the weight was on point~ unlike that other website suggested,1
4543,Trivial~ but still annoying when manufacturers can't give correct specs,1
4544,Tell me about the pockets,1
4545,I'm as particular about hand warmer pockets as you are about hoods :-) The only thing I don't like about the Grade VII is there's relatively little insulation in front of the pockets (plenty behind~ I would prefer the same on either side or even the opposite with more insulation in front like most jackets),1
4546,There's no fleece lining (just shell material) and it's easy to get what little down is there wet,1
4547,"It's sewn through construction in front of the pockets as well (or ""welded through~"" whatever)",1
4548,How is the butt coverage? Insulation behind the zipper?,1
4549,I ordered the same jacket for the same reasons and it's nice to see an actual review on it finally,1
4550,Mine should be here in a few days,1
4551,Isn't the daimond light fabric supposed to be strong and more rip resistant despite being thinner and softer?,1
4552,Thanks for this~ looks like a great deal,1
4553,what size do you have?,1
4554,The hand pockets are plenty deep~ as to be expected,1
4555,The outboard portion of the pockets have a fleece liner and the inboard portion is the same material used on the inner portion of the parka,1
4556,If you stuck wet gloves in the hand pockets~ I'd say chances are very high they'd soak through and saturate the outboard down baffles,1
4557,You're absolutely right~ I have an odd irritability when manufacturers don't dial in a hood,1
4558,I honestly feel Montane could have done a way better job with the Alpine 850's hood~ along with the Deep Heat's hood,1
4559," When they list it as ""helmet compatible~"" I feel like they're stretching it to the limits there",1
4560,The Alpine 850's hood is probably slightly more shallow that the Deep Heat's hood~ which as previously mentioned~ I had a problem with last year,1
4561,If I could change anything about either~ it's be the depth of the hood to better accommodate a climbing helmet and reasonable layering systems.,1
4562,You're welcome~ I enjoyed typing it up,1
4563,I ordered a men's large and glad I didn't go any bigger,1
4564," It fits bigger on the ""large"" spectrum for me~ but layers nicely.",1
4565,Yes~ that's my understanding,1
4566," According to Montane~ ""Diamond Lite is a lightweight 20 Denier nylon fabric with ‘liquid crystal’ yarns woven into the face~ making it extremely resistant to abrasion and tearing."" Time will tell if this really means anything with actual field use",1
4567," I think Black Diamond's new belay parka uses some-sort of ""liquid crystal"" technology~ too.",1
4568,The hand pockets are plenty deep~ as to be expected,1
4569,The outboard portion of the pockets have a fleece liner and the inboard portion is the same material used on the inner portion of the parka,1
4570,If you stuck wet gloves in the hand pockets~ I'd say chances are very high they'd soak through and saturate the outboard down baffles,1
4571,On that note~ Montane needs to study almost every single Arc'teryx hood and attempt to replicate,1
4572,I've yet to meet an Arc hood I didn't love,1
4573,I liked my Montane hood better :-) I think we just have different head shapes~ helmets and preferences,1
4574,Arc hoods don't have enough face coverage IMO,1
4575,It's my only complaint about the Dually,1
4576,I think all these sub-2lb parkas are relatively fragile and it's splitting hairs going from one to the other,1
4577,Only so much you can do with ~20d nylon,1
4578,The coated fabrics (Endurance/Pro/whatever-they're-calling-it-this-year) feel a little thicker due to the PU layer but I doubt they're actually stronger,1
4579,Yes~ that's my understanding,1
4580," According to Montane~ ""Diamond Lite is a lightweight 20 Denier nylon fabric with ‘liquid crystal’ yarns woven into the face~ making it extremely resistant to abrasion and tearing."" Time will tell if this really means anything with actual field use",1
4581," I think Black Diamond's new belay parka uses some-sort of ""liquid crystal"" technology~ too",1
4582,Mind sharing where you got the jacket from? I just recently picked up a Nilas for ~350~ but with this jacket having ~5oz more down fill for a similar weight and price~ I'm highly considering switching over to a warmer jacket since it can't really hurt.,1
4583,Mind sharing where you got the jacket from?  I replied via email,1
4584,My apologies for the delay.,1
4585,Hi AlpineIce~ Thanks for your detailed write up,1
4586," I'm currently going through a cold snap (-40C / -40F with wind chill and temps arounds -30C) and re-evaluating my ""of eff"" puffy",1
4587,Aka my girlfriend has usurped by OG Nilas (when it still used 850 down),1
4588,The Montane Alpine 850 looks like a great jacket for an emergency layer,1
4589,My main uses are ski touring and on temps below -15C I'd like to carry something like the Alpine 850,1
4590," I'm a medium (6'1"" 180lbs) build and was wondering about sizing - you went up to Large?   I was wondering if Medium would work if it's cut like a parka to get over my Atom LT and Goretex shell which are Mediums",1
4591,Can you help out on sizing?  As a Canadian I'd have to order online and pay duties so hoping to get some insight,1
4592,Thank you! -rad,1
4593,I recently ordered a medium,1
4594,"I'm 5'10"" 165 pounds and generally wear medium",1
4595,It fits over a medium Patagonia nano air and goretex shell (both medium~ though the shell is cut fairly loose)~ but its a bit snug to the point that the down is getting a little compressed~ particularly under the arms,1
4596,still totally fine~ but not ideal,1
4597,for my use I'd rather that than have the bagginess of a large if I'm wearing less underneath~ but you're a bit bigger than me~ so large may be the way to go.,1
4598,Considering your height & weight~ I'd go with at least a large~ maybe consider an XL~ too,1
4599,It's tough to recommend a size w/o knowing you,1
4600,It's a big coat to haul around for ski touring,1
4601,Even though it's only 725 grams (for the amount of warmth is provides) it'll take up a lot of room in your ski pack~ unfortunately.,1
4602," For those asking about the jacket~ I'm 5'9"" and 150lbs~ and I probably would not go any smaller than the medium for myself",1
4603,A bit long in the arms but otherwise fits well,1
4604,Unfortunately as Alpineice has pointed out~ the hood is a bit snug with a helmet on,1
4605,Depending on how much movement you need with the jacket on~ it could be a little restricting if you opted for a smaller jacket,1
4606,I'm hoping they come out with a new jacket next year with a slightly larger hood so that I can actually turn my head comfortably,1
4607,Otherwise the jacket is awesome.,1
4608,Looking to buy a softshell pant - mostly ice climbing and some mountaineering~ in the northeast,1
4609,I tend to run cold and am leaning towards the arcteryx gamma mx or rab calibre or the norrona windstopper falketind,1
4610,All seem to have good specs,1
4611,Any experience with either? other recommendations also welcome.,1
4612,Windstopper is madness for pants,1
4613,Just get hardshells instead if you go that route.,1
4614,My rab trousers fell apart after two days due to a horrendous design flaw~ I bought arcteryx instead and they are nicer in every way,1
4615,Basically~ get arcteryx~ it's completely worth it,1
4616,The Psphison Ar is what I got as a work for just about everything pair while being more durable than my gamma rock panta~ if you only want them for winter get the sv variant.,1
4617,I looked at hard shell~ but for ice they didn't seem to give the flexibility or hold up to sharp edges/crampons that I was looking for,1
4618,But I didn't have a pair to actually try out,1
4619,I have the opposite problem - I don't generate the heat to dump..,1
4620,:( I wore 3 layers of underarmor/base layers under the soft shells I was using,1
4621,Was zero out in NH last weekend...I have also looked at the OR cirque~ Mammut Eismeer and Marmot Tour,1
4622,But maybe  a hardshell would be better? Too many choices! :),1
4623,I've got the OR cirques and really like them a lot,1
4624,With a pair of thin merino baselayer pants I'm absolutely fine ice climbing in the low 20's,1
4625,I managed to punch a crampon point into the upper thigh when my belayer let me over a ledge too quickly and the tear did not run at all,1
4626,Just a little hole,1
4627,They also appear from my experience climbing in really wet conditions to be reasonably water resistant and they dry extremely quickly even just standing around in the cold,1
4628,What I like best is the fit which is amazing with it's integrated velcro straps on the waist,1
4629,I can't say enough good things about them~ especially considering you can get them on sale for just over 100 big ones,1
4630,And OR's return policy is great too.,1
4631,I too jumped on the bandwagon~ purchased and wore hardshell bibs this year,1
4632,For just ice cragging~ I wear my Black Diamond Dawn Patrol Schoeller softshell pants~ but for anything multi-pitch~ I've been wearing the   Jottnar Vanir Bibs made out of NeoShell,1
4633,NeoShell really is super breathable~ waterproof and comfortable,1
4634,Jottnar makes a women's version~ the  Vanir LT,1
4635,They're just pants~ no bib,1
4636,Very highly recommended,1
4637,Jottnar is a British company solely-focused on alpine climbing,1
4638,They have no hiking or ski line~ just climbing~ so they're entire product line is engineered~ built and designed to work with a harness~ mountaineering boots~ helmets~ etc,1
4639,I never really paid any attention to Jottnar until I decided on a hardshell bib setup and knew I wanted NeoShell,1
4640,There isn't many companies using NeoShell at this point~ and Jottnar was the only one I could find that made both pants and bibs in NeoShell specifically for alpine climbing,1
4641,In regards to keeping warm~ have you tried a different baselayer setup? The reason I ask - There's nothing wrong with Under Armor~ but maybe there's a better solution out there for you?  On cold days~ I wear the  Rab Nucleus Pants under either my hardshell or softshell,1
4642,They are a waffle-grid fleece pant very similar to Patagonia's R1 line,1
4643,Very warm and surprisingly very breathable,1
4644,If that still isn't warm enough~ I'd recommend the women's Rab Power Stretch Pro Pants or the women's  Patagonia Nano-Air Light Pants,1
4645,All three are made to be worn next-to-skin and under a hard or softshell pant,1
4646,I'm another big fan of Arc'teryx and you generally can't go wrong with any of their products.,1
4647,If you're gonna drop the $$ for Neoshell..,1
4648,nwalpine.com/store-1/neoshe…,1
4649,Omg~  those are awesome...,1
4650,I second the OR Cirques for several reasons,1
4651,First of all~ OR's warranty is insanely bomber,1
4652,Second~ they're super comfortable and made with schoeller,1
4653,Third~ I've owned a pair for 8 years and they're still going strong,1
4654,Fourth~ I burnt a hole in a pair and OR replaced them,1
4655,Fifth~ they're compatible with suspenders~ if that's your thing,1
4656,Sixth~ throw on a base layer and you're golden,1
4657,Seventh~ they're a small company that's run out of the US and is employed by real athletes and cool ass people who stand behind their work,1
4658,Arcteryx sucks,1
4659,The only thing they do right is GoreTex shells and articulated fits,1
4660,Everything else is garbage and marketing with the exception of a few select pieces,1
4661,I've owned arcteryx,1
4662,They overcharge~ their t-shirts are designed specifically to make sure your nipples are highly visible~ and their warranty is a load of bullshit compared to OR and Pata,1
4663,Buy OR,1
4664,Also~ the pata Kniferidge pants are pretty fking sweet~ but I think windstopper / neoshell gets way too moist at the level you're looking to do business.,1
4665,Obviously~ fit is key in addition to functionality,1
4666,As a woman who runs cold~ I usually go with a medium or heavy wt pair of long undies~ plus a pair of fairly thick softshell pants or gtx shell~ if it's sloppy out,1
4667," What separates my system from others is I've managed to find zip thru crotch versions of everything from the md wt base layer (an old version of OR's Wild Rose line) hvy wt base layer (Arcteryx)~ Isis lt wt softshell pants~ heavier softshell pants from an old Marmot ""climber suit"" (I separated the top from the bottom~ so I could wear the pants alone)~ to a pair of Patagonia stretch gtx pant",1
4668,It is SO nice not to have to drop trou while wearing a harness~ I often brag to my climbing buddies when I go to pee,1
4669,I don't know if you can find pants with this key function~ but it might be worth looking for.,1
4670,Kind of an old thread but I saw this and had to respond,1
4671,I own a lot of gear from OR as well as deadbird,1
4672,2 years of feedback for my psiphon ar's~ they're not very durable imo~ fabric gets torn to shit rock climbing and the zips get abraded immediately rendering them broken and useless.,1
4673,I was looking at some good deals on Psiphon AR but now am reconsidering based on your experience,1
4674,I was looking at some good deals on Psiphon AR but now am reconsidering based on your experience,1
4675,Honestly the psiphons are your best bet for burl the cirques look just as fragile~ I really likes the psiphon when i first got them and they are probably still are the burliest option on the market but i'm really disappointed by the prevalence of naked zips on the market in especially considering these things are supposed to be made for the alpine and they just can't hold up to real abuse,1
4676,Honestly it seems like an engineered weakness as there are so many ways to eliminate this failure mode.,1
4677,The Rab Kinetic Alpine pants are great so far..,1
4678,waterproof~ stretchy~ comfortable,1
4679,They are marketed as a stretchy hard shell,1
4680,The jury is still out on durability,1
4681,I plan to save them for mostly snow/ice climbs to keep the abrasion down,1
4682,OR Cirques are great~ durable~ and warm,1
4683,Mine have served me a well for 4 years and going strong.,1
4684,I have used the norrona falkitend flex 1 pants as a softshell for ice climbing,1
4685,They have held up well for about 4 years,1
4686,I am probably due for a replacement as they are not even a little water resistant at this point and I have put a few careless crampons into the fabric,1
4687,they WERE very water resistant for about the first 3 years of use,1
4688,They are my go-to winter everything except skiing pants and get a lot of use,1
4689,As an added bonus~ they hold up very well to the ice screws dangling off my harness-no snags at all in that area,1
4690,I highly recommend them-I will be buying a replacement pair~ unfortunately not in my signature orange color as they no longer make that color,1
4691,I also had OR Cirques,1
4692,Personally~ really disliked the fit and didn't wear them much,1
4693,They are more high wasted than the norronas,1
4694,They are a little thicker fabric and I know a ton of people absolutely love them.,1
4695,So I am interested in getting the new Sportiva g2SM's but was wondering if anyone has had any firsthand use/ reviews,1
4696,I am torn between getting the Baruntse or the G2's,1
4697,My toes do get cold and this year I have been trying the vapor barrier system to try and keep them warmer (unfortunately it hasn't been a very cold winter thus far),1
4698,Obviously the baruntse is the warmer option but its also like 5LBS per boot in a size 48!! and that adds up significantly if Im logging higher mileage,1
4699,The sportive review claims the G2 is very warm..,1
4700,warmer than spantek but~ has anyone put this to test? They seem so light that I wonder how much insulation they could actually have,1
4701,Here are my activities and location,1
4702,More mountaineering style climbing and trekking with light ice climbing,1
4703,so Im def not doing WI6-7 and sitting at a belay for hours,1
4704,Maybe doing some WI2 WI3 climbing,1
4705,Most of my hiking and climbing is in the Whites in NH or up in Maine,1
4706,Obviously the weather on washingon can be all over the place,1
4707,Id love to et into more serious mountaineering with a possible trip to the Cascades this summer,1
4708,I love the ease of use of the Boa closure system (its what I have on my snowboard boots)but just am worried about the actual warmth of the boots,1
4709,thanks for your input cheers •****UPDATE***** So this may be helpful for you cold toed big footed lads like myself,1
4710,I was finally able to get out in my new G2SM's this past weekend,1
4711,"Climbed Mt Willard on ""Left hand Monkey Wrench"" and then up ""The Cleft"" (WI2-3)with a bit of hiking and traversing mixed in between pitches and the walk off",1
4712,Temp was about -5 deg F at the start of the day and warming up to a balmy 20-25deg,1
4713,I wore 1 pair of thick smartwool socks and Petzl Vasek crampons,1
4714,Out for about 7.5 hrs Boots fit great with 1 thick smartwool sock (too much room with just a thin pair),1
4715,toes did begin to get a little cold while I was standing at first belay in the shade in cold temps but not really bad,1
4716,The rest of the day my toes were totally fine- warm on the hike out,1
4717,My crampons fit great on there (with the long bar cuz I have size 49 boots) The only complaint that I have and~ I believe someone else noted the same problem in an earlier post~ is this,1
4718,I found that during the hiking portion of the day the boa coil for the forefoot part of the boot seemed to dig into the joint where my foot meets my leg,1
4719,It wasn't necessarily painful but more irritating,1
4720,Ill have to play around a little more with the tension on the lower coil and maybe its just a matter of keeping it loose to hike and then tight to climb,1
4721,Seems like something that could be alleviated if they distributed the tension from the coil a little more,1
4722,My boa coil snowboard boots don't have this problem but they only have 1 coil that covers the whole boot,1
4723,Other than that everything felt great and Im looking forward to getting lots more use through the season and giving another update later,1
4724,These boots are so light weight it really just felt like hiking in some nice winter boots,1
4725,Thanks for everyones feedback and input,1
4726,Ill keep you posted,1
4727,Enjoy the winter,1
4728,Climb On *****update 4/4/17****** Ive been climbing in these boots all season~ mostly multipitch ice and mountaineering (WI2-3) stuff but some harder single pitch climbs on toprope (WI4 ish) and I am still in love with these boots,1
4729,Comfy to hike all day in with the lower BOA loose~ great performance on ice with the BOA's cinched up,1
4730,My toes havnt been cold at all all season and after climbing shoestring gully (6 pitches and about a 1500 foot approach climb) with a friend this past weekend who wore Baruntses I am happy to have the G2's,1
4731,He complained about how uncomfortable they were to hike in long durations,1
4732,So far durability has been great,1
4733,they get on and off very easily and Im not left messing with laces loosening up or anything,1
4734,Hope this helps anyone out there looking,1
4735,Never even held the G2SM in my hands~ but a couple things can be deduced from the marketing material:,1
4736,I've also never even held  g2's~ but I have a pair of Baruntse and they are super warm,1
4737,My feet were comfortable when it was -35 degrees while I was in Alaska last winter and I have no complaints about them for ice climbing in New Hampshire this year~ my feet usually sweat in them~ but I'd rather be too warm than too cold,1
4738,- Chris,1
4739,I've checked out the G2,1
4740,It's worth the money IF you need that much boot,1
4741,The fact that LaSportiva used the Boa lace system should tell you the fit is amazing with none of problems the early Boa laces had,1
4742,I thought the best part of the boot was the fact you can loosen and tighten the boot easily during a long route,1
4743,Haven't worn them outside so can't say how warm,1
4744,The G2 is light,1
4745,I stand corrected.,1
4746,Yea My main concern is the warmth because my toes have a tendency to get pretty cold but if I don't have to lug around 10 LBS of boot that would be fantastic,1
4747,"I'm 6'6"" 215LS so that's enough to lug around as is especially with my pack full of gear and I do love the idea of the Boa ties and not having to lace up and re-tie with cold fingers",1
4748,The G2 is pretty expensive,1
4749,Damn these hobbies,1
4750,Photography and climbing are not a poor mans games I guess,1
4751,Thanks for everyone's input,1
4752,Still hoping to hear from someone that has actually worn G2's in the cold.,1
4753,If you go to the Whites a lot check out IME~ they have them in stock.,1
4754,For what it's worth summer climbin in the cascades doesn't need more than Nepals,1
4755,In fact anything more than Nepals and you'll be kicking yourself...with sweaty feet,1
4756,So I wouldn't take cascade summer climbing into consideration when looking at G2s,1
4757,TRUE,1
4758,Nepals are even overkill for most cascade climbing,1
4759,I mostly use my trango s evo,1
4760,I wouldn't want to do something like Liberty Ridge in anything less than Nepals,1
4761,But I do have cold feet,1
4762,Did rainier a few times last year in my trangos and couldn't feel my toes for 3 months afterwards.,1
4763,OGE in Vermont has them in stock as well,1
4764,The G2 in a lot of ways is a lighter version of the Spantik from what I can tell,1
4765,Holding them in person the difference in weight between the two is pretty impressive for sure,1
4766,The advantage of the G2 is indeed on longer trips where the weight savings means less fatigue and the removable inner boot means no cold feet in the morning,1
4767,I think for type of climbing you like to do they will be plenty warm,1
4768,Other things to consider: warmer socks that fit well is a huge help~ and the red hot superfeet insoles help with heat loss through the bottom of the boot when standing around on cold ground,1
4769,Always remember keeping your core warm keeps the extremities warm as well.,1
4770,Got the G2s they are pretty perfect~ seem to run 1/2 larger i think though so dont add a size like some of the general boot fit principles on the Sportiva site states~ and there isnt a removable footbed/sock liner~ but there is a fixed foamy thingy in the bed so if you wear an insert it will have to stack it on top of the fixed liner.,1
4771,I climbed in the second gen Baturas (42) for years,1
4772,My toes would also get cold (and bashed recently),1
4773,I tried the G2SMs on at Bengate,1
4774,I have a narrow~ low volume foot and I felt like my foot was swimming in the G2SMs,1
4775,I actually thought the Scarpa 6000s fit me better,1
4776,I ended up going with the Batura 2.0s (42.5) for the fit and so far they feel warmer than the older Baturas,1
4777,I also think a 6000m boot is probably more than I need,1
4778,Good luck.,1
4779,Thanks for the info everyone,1
4780,Chris I have been to IME a bunch of times but since im a size 48 -49 its hard to find them in stock anywhere,1
4781,I called the other day and they had just gotten a shipment of G2 but weren't sure of all sizes yet,1
4782,May run there this weekend,1
4783,Thatcher~ I wanted to get nepals but when I tried on 48 Nepal cubs they were too small and they don't go any bigger than 48,1
4784,Bummer,1
4785,Ill see if they are in this weekend and then hopefully try them on,1
4786,I guess Id rather have warmer feet than colder cuz I can always do the plastic bag barrier if needed for sweat,1
4787,Cheers everyone and happy climbing    (wishing there was more snow and ice in NH right now ):,1
4788,I think La Sportiva makes the Nepal Extreme for the euro market and it comes in bigger sizes than 48~ maybe 49 and 50? Just another option to keep in mind.,1
4789,so another question for all you who own the G2SM   how do you feel they run for sizing? a little big~ a little small~ or true to size? if im gonna have to special order a pair I want to make sure they fit so I don't have to send them back for another size,1
4790,Brandonian says they run a half size large but the guys at IME in Conway said they run a half size small..,1
4791,Sooo what do you think   THanks everyone,1
4792,I've been climbing in NH in Baruntses this year and they are warm enough to for any day in the Whites,1
4793,Many days I wish for a less warm boot,1
4794,They should get you just about anywhere you want to go and are much cheaper than the G2 and climb perfectly fine.,1
4795,Drew~    I'd say the G2SM run 1/2 size too big,1
4796,I have three other la sportiva boots that fit perfectly~ ordered the G2SM in the same size and I have a lot of extra room at my toes.,1
4797,I've found the sizing to be pretty spot on maybe a little roomy over my other sportiva boots in the same size,1
4798,i def would not size down,1
4799,even though they are super light its still a big boot and imho they climb well but like a big boot climbs,1
4800,overall pretty comfy and the lacing system is awesome,1
4801,Total lockdown of the heel unlike the batura,1
4802,def overkill for me unless the temps are well below zero.,1
4803,Update,1
4804,I received my G2SM in the mail yesterday,1
4805,Size 49,1
4806,tried them on this morning and like a weirdo wore them to the gym to get on stairmill and treadmill with them and test them out (didn't want to mess them up outside so I can still return them in case they don't fit great),1
4807,I wore the same sock setup I would normally wear in the mountains,1
4808,Thin sock liner~ plastic bag for vapor barrier~ medium thick smartwool sock over the bag,1
4809,Observations so far:   fit is pretty good,1
4810,Seems pretty spot on for sizing,1
4811,a 48 would def be too small for me (I normally wear size 14/15 hikers and running shoes),1
4812,Heel has a tiny bit of movement and my toes are def at the max length,1
4813,Not jammed up against the front of the boot but not a ton of extra room,1
4814,on the stairmill I didn't really notice much heel slip unless I really leaned forward and flexed onto my toes (similar to steep hiking with crampons) I also tried standing on a little tiny ledge putting as much pressure on the smallest amount of toe as possible to see how my heels felt in there,1
4815,the boots did great,1
4816,again a little bit of heel movement but maybe some inserts will relieve that,1
4817,on the treadmill I put it to an incline of 15 and 1.5mph while walking backwards to try and simulate hiking downhill,1
4818,I did not notice any significant discomfort from my toes jamming into the front of the boot,1
4819,normal walking around and on treadmill these boots feel great,1
4820,super light~ not too clunky (for a big mountain boot with stiff soles),1
4821,I did notice a little bit of a pressure point on my right foot at the joint where my foot and shin come together when stepping high on the stairmill,1
4822,Possibly from the boa coil,1
4823,Ill have to play around a little with the inner boot and everything to make sure I keep the tension distributed evenly all around,1
4824,Played with both boa coils to see how it feels with tighter~ looser tension on either coil,1
4825,Very nice to be able to fine tune a bit without having to tie/ untie so much,1
4826,That being said..,1
4827,I def do worry about the what if factor when it comes to boa coil,1
4828,I have had boa system on all of my snowboarding boots,1
4829,My last pair of snowboarding boots have lasted me about 5 years and still no failure but the wire on my snowboard boots is def a bit thicker than the wire for G2's and if my board boots fail I can go to the lodge and get drunk~ if my mountain boots fail it could def suck (but I can still get drunk),1
4830,Im sure they took all the care needed to get strong durable materials (for $800+ list price they damn well better have!!)   And my other concern is just that pressure point on my foot joint I noticed,1
4831,Only noticed it on my right foot so Maybe I just didn't have something lined up correctly or needed to play a bit,1
4832,Otherwise I think these boots are gonna be awesome,1
4833,Im bummed that the New England winter has sucked this year and its going to be like 70 degrees out this weekend so I doubt Ill get a chance to test these puppies in the cold till next winter,1
4834,Ill try and get up and do some technical climbing with them in the next week or 2 and then I can add more info on how they feel with crampons and such,1
4835,Thanks for everyones help in the process,1
4836,I hope my review here is helpful for people.,1
4837,Dude i would definitally try and challenge the plastic bags for vapor barriers~ and the multiple socks and just use the 1 right pair of socks and let the boots do there job $825 double boots shouldnt need plastic bags for optimal function.,1
4838,or is the vapor barrier for mountaineering boots on the treadmill odor control so they can be returned???,1
4839,well I was doing vapor barrier for 2 reasons   1,1
4840,My feet sweat like crazy and soak my boots and socks which leads to..,1
4841,my boots and socks get soaked so they get cold,1
4842,I am hoping that these boots will be warm enough that I don't need to worry about it,1
4843,but my feet sweat like crazy no matter what boots/ shoes/ sandals I wear,1
4844,if its not freezing out I wouldn't worry so much but if its a below freezing day I prefer to make sure my insulation socks are dry,1
4845,"  Im 6'6"" and in very good shape cardio wise but I think that the fact that my blood has to circulate so far to get to the extremities means my fingers and toes get cold quick",1
4846,Ive had mild frostbite on both my big toes before and it left them numb for about 6 months,1
4847,now they get cold quicker than they used to,1
4848,I wear smartwool either medium or heavy cushion,1
4849,Happy to take suggestions on socks or anything people like,1
4850,All about trying something new,1
4851,thanks,1
4852,Those double boots are meant to be worn with thin socks,1
4853,I wear ski liners when wearing my 6000s,1
4854,Have you tried deoderant on your feet? Helps me.,1
4855,could also try a neoprene sock~ does the same thing as the vapor barrier but is a little more comfortable,1
4856,Hi..,1
4857,I use the following boots and normally wear a 10.5 us mens  New Balance 105 EE in most of their running shoes,1
4858,Batura 2.0 43.5   Trango Cube GTX 44.0   Trango TRK TTX 44.0   Ultra Raptor 44.0    I got the G2SM in a 44.5~ but I put a Superfoot Merino Grey footbed in them,1
4859,I have used them so far in only -10 weather,1
4860,I don't get cold feet easy and on a long 3 hour approach~ a 4 hour ice climb and 2 hour descent my very thin liner sock was damp and my medium weight Lorpen midweight wook sock was dampish,1
4861,If you were on a multi-day it would be best to dry out the inner boot at night if possible~ make sure you have on fresh new dry sock the next date and alternate again if possible,1
4862,Without the Superfoot insole a 44 would have been ok for size,1
4863,I feel they are warmer than the other La Sportiva doubles~ but the reduction in weight and bulk are a major plus,1
4864,"    I don't like the ""trench foot"" effect of a vapor sock",1
4865,I think just letting your feet dry in your sleeping bag at night and always having dry liners to change to is  most reasonable,1
4866,If you had to go multiple days without a sock change would still be ok I feel,1
4867,As important is hydration and not letting other extremities get cold,1
4868,That being said it is worth also trying on the NEW Scarpa 6000,1
4869,They just fit differently,1
4870,I like the BOA as it was easy to change the fit during the day~ at least easier than laces it seemed.,1
4871,Well~ we (I) use to have similar issue~ sweaty sweaty..,1
4872,plastic bag around your foot is OK but we figured out something else: I use to put sanitary napkins into the boot!    Honestly~ try it out,1
4873,Sanitary napkins~ lightweight and very absorbing!   It takes a shit lot of sweat and can be changed when necessary (usually once/ day),1
4874,Never had again any bigger issues with wet/ damp inner boot...,1
4875,Hi~   I bought a pair of the G2 SM's,1
4876,LOVE THEM!  Love the BOA,1
4877,Can easily loosen them for moderate approaches and then tighten them up when the crampons go on,1
4878,No foot slippage,1
4879,Solid and strong,1
4880,Light and warm,1
4881,The double boot is very warm and liner is easily removed,1
4882,J,1
4883,Interested in these boots for a climb in Peru~ anyone climb above 14k in these? Not sure if these will be too hot for Peru~ hope to use them on Denali as well.,1
4884,Why is everybody trying to tell him not to use a vapor barrier? The whole boot is all ready one giant vapor barrier~ the best thing he could possible do is prevent the liner from getting damp~ the less moisture in the boot the warmer he will stay.,1
4885,Allow me to call bullshit on literally everything you just typed,1
4886," Seb do you even G2 bra? I believe we are arguing the same point blah blah blah (""loose layers"" create gaps between your puffy~ insulation~ baselayer~ ect",1
4887,filled with air your body heats up thats how warmth is created and stowed) and (the EVA boot is a vapor barrier in and of itself)...,1
4888,My point was La Sportiva engineers made a very fine boot you shouldn't need anything other than a wool sock IMO especially since I've been running these boots for the last year,1
4889,"However if you would like to run vapor ""to the 4th power"" barrier bullshit under you G2s feel free bro! IMO thats just not what LA SPORTIVA had in mind",1
4890,Thanks for your interpretation though.,1
4891,I think the individual that started this thread got a pair of G2s and I hope he's not running a bunch of extra bullshit under them,1
4892,If you have the time please blast some feedback,1
4893,I hope everyone's opinions were helpful,1
4894,BEWARE OF BOOGER EATERS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC BAGS.,1
4895,Hello everybody! I've just used the G2 SM on Elbrus and this is my feedback~ hope you will find it useful:   First thoughts:   - I bought a new pair~ I normally wear 42-43~ my G2's are 44,1
4896,Perfect fit with winter socks,1
4897,- I had to wear them for nearly 15 hours on the airplane towards Russia,1
4898,No problem what so ever,1
4899,Easy to wear~ easy to open and close,1
4900,Especially compared to other bots that don't have the BOA system,1
4901,- I feel as if I had the perfect boots,1
4902,I wore them in temperatures between -+25 Celsius and -20 Celsius and my feet felt perfect,1
4903,- During the night time I just put the inner boots in my sleeping bag and by morning they were dry and cozy,1
4904,The EVA does not absorb sweat so they dry really fast,1
4905,I think in the daytime you just need 15 minutes of sun (and positive temperatures) to dry the inner boot~ no matter how much your feet sweat,1
4906,First problems:   Well..,1
4907,to get right to the point..,1
4908,the BOA system failed,1
4909,The steel cable just came of from the upper system,1
4910,I nearly had a heart attack as this happened when I was in the Priut basecamp at 4100m,1
4911,I have put photos for you to see what happened,1
4912,Fortunately I did not panic and improvised a quick DIY fix,1
4913,Now I am still in vacation but as soon as I get home I will send La Sportiva a message with the pictures to see what they think about this problem and go back to the shop for a new pair,1
4914,I still want this boot,1
4915,It's just to perfect to let it go because of a BOA failure,1
4916,It's not La Sportiva's fault~ it's the BOA system that's not perfect.,1
4917,as it seems,1
4918,It's just to hard for me to get back to standard laces after spending these weeks up on Elbrus with the G2,1
4919,I love these boots,1
4920,I will let you know what La Sportiva had to say about this problem,1
4921,The wire just came out of the BOA The wire hanging out of the BOA  Quick fix: made a lasso to put it around the BOA Put a little bit of tape around the lasso to keep it from opening,1
4922,broken and DIY fixed BOA system The lasso that made the difference between a failed expedition and a successful ascent,1
4923,G2 SM on Elbus 5642m~ with broken BOA and DIY fix,1
4924,Perfect boots with BOA systems that still need user input and feedback to become fail proof,1
4925,....,1
4926,Hey all~ I rocked some G2 SMs for a 4 week trip to the Cordillera Blanca this summer,1
4927,Here's some observations..,1
4928,Pros:    Very light for long days with lots of elevation gain   Boa was very easy to dial in the right fit right when I needed it,1
4929,Glacial travel - looser~ AI3 - tighten those bad boys up!   Feet stayed dry and toasty warm   Cons:   The boots are already showing quite a bit of wear! The fabric on the outside of the boot on the inside of my feet is almost halfway worn through already,1
4930,It's the spot right where the rubber ends and the gaitor fabric starts,1
4931,Same place where your ankle bone sticks out on the inside,1
4932,I had to get a thick insole put in the boot because my feet are skinny,1
4933,Sinched all the way down~ my toes kept smacking the front of the toe box when I kicked,1
4934,Solved with thick super feet soles.,1
4935,Wow lots of feedback from people who don't actually own G2 SMs!   I actually own G2 SMs and they are amazing boots,1
4936,Comfortable~ dry~ warm~ and they can climb,1
4937,They are pretty new so I haven't put much time on them since they are very new~ about 30 days~ but I have climbed 5-6000m peaks in them where they performed spectacularly,1
4938,Also~ the Boa system is pretty sweet in the fact that you can adjust them very quickly on the fly,1
4939,They are perfect for slogging through glacial fields and then tightening up for pitched climbing,1
4940,I have indeed been worried that the wire would snap~ so I try not to crank on the knob too hard,1
4941,I found that once they are snug~ ratcheting the knob harder and hard doesn't do much more than put more stress on the cable,1
4942,I had Spantiks prior to these~ and there is very little comparison between the two other than the fact that they both fit similarly and are mostly yellow,1
4943,In no way~ shape~ or form~ are the G2 SM and the Baruntse/Spantik the same in class.,1
4944,I just got a few pair of these to try on and keep one~ for Elbrus~ and I am out of time!   How much heel lift should I have?  will it go away with use?   The 46 feel just a bit snug at the toes but I have no heel lift   The 46.5 feel fantastic in size~ however I have probably 1/2+ heel lift,1
4945,Any advice?   Thanks,1
4946,I just received a pair of G2 SM's - eventually intended for Denali~ but with some adventures beforehand,1
4947,There's a lot of pros~ but a couple of cons too that I wanted to share and get thoughts on:   - I only see one mention of a boa failure above,1
4948,Out of the box (although I have a suspicion they might have been 'tested' by someone else previously)~ one of the 4 boas on my pair was a little tricky to push in - looked like it was turning off-axis when trying to tighten~ and also skipping as though some internal teeth had been rounded down or something,1
4949,After continued attempts to resolve it~ I guess I've rounded them down more - that boa won't tighten now,1
4950,- when I keep my foot flat on the ground~ and pivot forward at my ankle~ I can feel the boot dig into the top of ankle,1
4951,I suspect this is because one boa secures the boot across the top of the foot~ while the other secures around the ankle - but there is no support bridging these two sections~ so the boot folds in at the junction of them~ and into the front of your ankle,1
4952,That's my best effort at explaining it anyway - anyone notice a similar issue?,1
4953,On the failure,1
4954,Did the lace just come out of the reel or did it break?   If it just came out~ you can take a small screwdriver and open the reel and re-insert (BOA has great videos on this) and it will work as normal,1
4955,If it broke~ then a new lace has to be threaded,1
4956,The laces cost $4 each from BOA and a reel is $8,1
4957,Prolly a good idea to pack one of each for a trip~ just as you would pack a spare lace for any boot.,1
4958,It's so he can return them without them being all funked out,1
4959,The liner insulation is EVA (closed cell) so it shouldn't pickup that much moisture to affect insulation,1
4960,The only reason to use a VBL with these boots would maybe be to keep your thicker socks clean and dry~ you'll still need to clean the liner socks though,1
4961,I think these boots will probably replace the Spantics in the near future~ took a look at them last weekend~ they're sooo lite,1
4962,This might be a boot to look at if you're in my neck of the woods (Quebec).,1
4963,I picked up a pair of G2 SM boots from Mountain Gear,1
4964,I LOVE THESE BOOTS! Spent the last two days climbing waterfall ice and they perform great on technical ground,1
4965,The BOA is awesome and these are my first boots with an integrated gaiter so I love that too,1
4966,Highly recommended!,1
4967,Just got my pair of G2s today! Only the front bail of my grivel g14s don’t seem to fit so nice,1
4968,Is there a wider bail? Or can someone suggest a crampon that fits better? Has anyone else ran into this problem?,1
4969,2 things:  1) The upper BOA on my right foot failed in exactly the way that you mentioned,1
4970,Unfortunately while up in Hyalite,1
4971,Seemed off axis~ skipped teeth~ etc,1
4972,I was able to get the dial to mostly tighten by exerting pressure axially while spinning (I pushed the dial down while turning....) but it didn't hold so I had to improvise,1
4973,I know for a fact it broke when I simply tried to crank things down a little too hard,1
4974,I've replaced it ($8) and now I just think about the boot a little differently,1
4975,Basically~ I get them tight~ as tight as I would normally get a lace-up boot~ and nothing more,1
4976,Even though technically the BOA~ unlike a lace-up~ let's me take the tightness to 11~ I only take it to 10,1
4977,Digressing~ it's pretty goddamn Gucci but I love the fact that I can hone in and fiddle so quickly and easily,1
4978,And they are super warm and climb and approach really well,1
4979,For what I'm doing~ cost-benefit still puts these very high in the benefit column,1
4980,2) The digging in that you and others are experiencing is almost certainly due to the velcro closures on the inner boot,1
4981,Quick fix is to secure the lower velcro further towards your toes~ and the upper velcro closure higher up your ankle,1
4982,This creates space between the two velcro closures~ without which there is a pinch point,1
4983,The longer term fix is to actually cut away a few cm from each strap (bottom of the upper strap and top of the lower strap) to create that space,1
4984,Hope that works for you! Credit Brady @ IME for figuring that out,1
4985,Still loving my G2SMs and looking forward to taking them to Peru,1
4986,Can someone link me to where I can get a BOA repair kit for them~ just in case?,1
4987," G2 SM Boa Repair Information  Edited Jan 12~ '18 4 pm AKT (7 pm CST) based on an email from Boa Customer Service Email response from Boa Customer Service: ""Most La Sportiva G2SM boots are equipped with the M3-S dial~ and HP42 lace",1
4988,"The upper lace is a 100cm~ and the lower lace is typically a 60cm terminated lace.""  Repair instructions are here: https://www.theboasystem.com/repair#boa-m3-system Boa M3-S Spare Parts Kit ($4): https://store.theboasystem.com/product.php?productid=16198 HP42 Laces (select length on the Order page): https://store.theboasystem.com/product.php?productid=16152   Recommendations:  I sent a followup email with these questions to Boa~ expect another update Monday: * Boa currently only sells 100cm+ replacement HP42 laces~ so I asked if there is anywhere to buy 60cm replacement lower laces~ or if they recommend cutting longer laces or using a longer lace and tucking away the excess * I asked if you can repair any M3-type dial with any other M3-type spare parts kit~ or if only M3-S spools and dials fit in M3-S housings",1
4989,Extra search keywords: fix~ broken,1
4990,Thank Gerrit,1
4991,I actually emailed BOA last week inquiring about spare parts - the rep stated that they do not have all the parts on their website because the G2SM uses an unusual lacing setup,1
4992,Thankfully~ they are sending me some spare parts.,1
4993,Boa faliures- I - had an initial issue with the boa lacing system and I contacted boa they sent me a few free reels and free laces and some tools for adjusting,1
4994,-the next failure was my fault I was planning to just get up and walk across camp,1
4995,so I stepped into the boots and zippered up the gator without cinching down the lacing system at all and it got caught in the zipper,1
4996,I carry a small repair kit with one reel elase and a little tool for adjusting it was a pretty simple fix but it was quite worrying at ffirst.NEVER DO THAT,1
4997,Other Notes on the Boot- - I feel that my insulation has worn out in it's warmpth a bit,1
4998,Yet~ I often have river crossings on approach and this probably contributed significantly but just a warning,1
4999,Overall I have really liked the boots ( and the stock insoles) and highly recommend them they start to look beat up quickly but still keep chugging along well even if they look ugly,1
5000,For reference I have two~  month-long each trips on them where they were the only foot wear used and probably 2 and a half ice seasons on them,1
5001,Just received the boots today and goddamn they seem sweet,1
5002,Works of art,1
5003,REALLY hoping to take them to Peru in July...,1
5004,The BOA concern seems manageable~ especially after seeing the great info in this thread,1
5005,The other problem—the painful pressure point at the front of the ankle when the foot/boot bends—seems much more troubling,1
5006,It doesn’t seem to be the BOA wire causing the problem~ as it’s all above and below the ankle “hinge” when tightened,1
5007,And it doesn’t seem like the velcro closure tabs on the liner either~ as Dan suggests,1
5008,In my boot at least~ those aren’t at the pinch point and aren’t the culprit,1
5009,The trouble comes from the fat~ rigid sewn lower seam where the more supple material is attached to allow the liner to flex,1
5010,The secure hold of the BOA and the outer boot seem to make it so that the boot’s flex is exactly on this seam,1
5011,The boot upper articulates forward and all the layers fold~ pressing this seam into a tender spot,1
5012,It seems like this could be a significant problem~ at least for me~ as I tend to find myself on   “endurance” ice or moderately steep neve—right at the sweet spot of pain in this boot,1
5013,I know lots of folks love this boot~ and climb hard~ and do long trips in them,1
5014,Is this not such a big thing to them? Any fixes~ aside from new liners at $175+?,1
5015,Break them in? I think I had a similar-ish issue for the first few hours of wear but it's hard to remember.,1
5016,Just received the boots today and goddamn they seem sweet,1

5029,Is this not such a big thing to them? Any fixes~ aside from new liners at $175+?  Aaron~ I'm taking my G2SMs to Peru this summer! I think you just need to break them in,1
5030,How much have you worn them?,1
5031,Thanks Greg and Nick! Yeah Peru—can’t wait~ first trip! You guys are prob right about breaking them in~ I hope,1
5032,I’m just hyper-wary of potential long term boot problems~ as I’m doing battle now with a separate problem caused by my ski boots~ and spreading to my regular~ formerly comfortable~ climbing boots,1
5033,Nick~ I’ve only worn them around them house~ doing laps clomping up and down the stairs,1
5034,I want to keep the return option open as long as possible,1
5035,Haha~ maybe I’ll take them to the gym like someone else above did and see how that works,1
5036,Not weird at all! So Greg~ for you the problem just went away with time and usage? That seems encouraging,1
5037,Has anyone had the problem persist to the point of being a deal breaker?,1
5038,Fair enough,1
5039,What objectives do you have in mind? You could consider returning the G2SMs and trying the G5 boots - from what I've been told~ the G5s (formerly Batura 2.0) is warm enough for 6000m peaks in the Blanca,1
5040,We are planning to head into the Ishinca valley,1
5041,Seems like a lot of options in there to get started in the range~ especially for newish~ moderately experienced climbers like me! Everything down there looks amazing~ and we are considering Tocllaraju hopefully~ after Urus and Ishinca,1
5042,Ranrapalca would be the icing on the icing~ but probably a bit far fetched for our trip,1
5043,Thanks for the G5 suggestion,1
5044,I’ll give it some thought,1
5045,I’d love to have full-on doubles~ and the G2’s seem like the best,1
5046,I’m going to see how they feel after a prolonged stair or gym machine session,1
5047,Gonna get some looks I’m sure~ haha,1
5048,I’ve got a pair of Lowa 6000 RD’s coming too~ for comparison’s sake,1
5049,A lot floating on the old credit card right now,1
5050,Have you looked at the Arc'teryx boots? Lower profile doubles~ more like G5 sized,1
5051,Curious as to your thoughts on the Lowas,1
5052,They supposedly make really nice stuff~ though those are a bit heavier,1
5053,I guess I sort of have a different inclination than the others,1
5054,Mountaineering boots don't really stretch like rock shoes or hiking boots,1
5055,If they suck trying them on for a few minutes I'm skeptical that it'll work itself out after a long day,1
5056,Have you tried just taping a piece of foam at that tender spot to protect you from the seam?,1
5057,I guess I sort of have a different inclination than the others,1
5058,Mountaineering boots don't really stretch like rock shoes or hiking boots,1
5059,If they suck trying them on for a few minutes I'm skeptical that it'll work itself out after a long day,1
5060,Have you tried just taping a piece of foam at that tender spot to protect you from the seam?  Mountaineering boots don't stretch~ but they absolutely pack out over time,1
5061,This is especially true with double boots,1
5062,Yeah~ I'm not sure that's going to help with his particular problem of a pressure point at a seam though? Here's hoping for his sake,1
5063,Thanks jdejace and Nick~ for input and for keeping this thread alive,1
5064,Jdjace~ I had given the Arc’teryx some thought~ but I’m looking to future goals of 6000-7000 meters~ and I want to error on the side of more than less~ warmth wise,1
5065,I’ve got good circulation~ but man~ once I stop moving I get cold fast,1
5066,Those look sweet though~ with solid reviews~ and this is the first time the dead bird item is cheaper than the others I’m looking at! Agreed with both of you on mtn boots not stretching~ but double boot liners packing out,1
5067,And wondering if that process would soften the seam~ or just make it worse? Hard to say,1
5068,Just seems like a bad omen to start with a problem out of the box,1
5069,Also~ I have not tried the foam pad fix just yet~ and I’m hoping not to need to~ but that’s a good idea,1
5070,I’m going to keep trying with the G2’s—they’re just too perfect in every other way to give up on,1
5071,I’ll post some thoughts and comparisons between the G2SM’s and the Lowa’s when I’ve got both in hand,1
5072,I’ve had Lowa Mtn Expert EVO for 4 years—my entire mountaineering “career” haha—and they’re great,1
5073,Solid construction~ warm~ stiff~ durable,1
5074,I would hope to have a similar report about the 6000’s,1
5075,Not much out there review wise except this~ a few years old: http://coldthistle.blogspot.com/2013/09/lowa-6000-evo-rd-double-boot.html?m=1,1
5076,Nick—in the mind-numbing haze of boot-think I forgot to ask~ have you been to the Cordillera Blanca before? My girlfriend and I are really looking forward to the trip~ and trying to climb Hood every chance we get~ as many different routes as possible to train up skills and fitness,1
5077,What and where are you planning on climbing down there?,1
5078,Yea I was freaking out too~ you'd be a bit fucked if it was constantly painful to move,1
5079,"A little bit of ""front pointing"" on the edge of some steps~ and some quick weird looking walks around the neighborhood and they were good",1
5080,Have fun in Peru!,1
5081,Yea I was freaking out too~ you'd be a bit fucked if it was constantly painful to move,1
5082,"A little bit of ""front pointing"" on the edge of some steps~ and some quick weird looking walks around the neighborhood and they were good",1
5083,Have fun in Peru! Thanks Greg! And it’s good to hear the issue can resolve itself,1
5084,That seems to be a common phenomenon from the online chatter~ which is great news~ because these boots are otherwise perfect,1
5085,And sooo light,1
5086,Once you try them on~ you’re ruined for anything else,1
5087,We are planning to head into the Ishinca valley,1
5088,Seems like a lot of options in there to get started in the range~ especially for newish~ moderately experienced climbers like me! Everything down there looks amazing~ and we are considering Tocllaraju hopefully~ after Urus and Ishinca,1
5089,Ranrapalca would be the icing on the icing~ but probably a bit far fetched for our trip,1

5095,I’ve got a pair of Lowa 6000 RD’s coming too~ for comparison’s sake,1
5096,A lot floating on the old credit card right now Nice,1
5097,I have the same plan~ I'll be down there the first two weeks of July,1
5098,Enjoy your trip and good luck with the boots!,1
5099,Nick~ cool—it’s looking like we’ll overlap down there,1
5100,I’ll keep my eyes peeled for G2’s and say hi!  Thanks again for your input,1
5101,Now the crux is finding a pair 1/2 size up to do my due diligence,1
5102,Hey guys! Glad I found this forum,1
5103,I just got a pair of the G2 and despite the spring weather I decided to take them up to the whites of NH to break them in and give them a test run,1
5104,A few things...,1
5105,I definitely like the sock to come above the boot,1
5106,I wear a snartwool phd ski sock,1
5107,Its is a medium thickness and ends just velo the knee,1
5108,Hi fellas~I know this is an old post but hoping my reply doesn’t fall on deaf ears,1
5109,I’m currently in the process of picking up some G2’s for a trip to Nepal in October & have a few sizing questions for all you that currently own a pair,1
5110,I have a size 9 (42) at home that I’m testing~ & a 9.5 (42.5) on the way,1
5111,I’m a street shoe size 8.5~ but I found out the hard way (after losing a pinky toenail on a weekend trip & constantly banging my big toe on any long descents) I’m a size 9 in hiking boots.1) What is the acceptable amount of wiggle room in the toe box? In the size 9’s i can wiggle my toes just a lil but it’s pretty darn snug,1
5112,Can’t overlap\cross  my big toe.2) Kicking steps~ should there be no feeling of the front of the boot at all? I can definitely feel I’m at the front of the boot~ but don’t get the toe nail banging or any real discomfort like in my hiking boots.3)Overall fit or tightness,1
5113,Should the boot initially fit like a glove or should there be a lil room for swelling? The boot is really snug all over with just a heavy duty sock~ even a standard sock,1
5114,I’m concerned it will be real tight after my feet possibly swell from altitude or late in the day after a trek,1
5115,I have a couple days before the 9.5 boot arrives & I can compare it to the 9,1
5116,But was hoping I could get some advice while I wait,1
5117,Thanks in advance!,1
5118,Sounds too small to me,1
5119,See what the 9.5 feels like.,1
5120,definitely sounds too big glen~ go up at least half a size.,1
5121,Wore G2 SMs up Denali (West Buttress) from May 20th to June 7th~ 2018,1
5122,They performed excellently,1
5123,They fit true to size for my feet~ no need to size up or down compared to other footwear,1
5124,I have a wide forefoot and the fit was good~ no pinchpoints for me like some have reported~ and no blisters,1
5125,They also took old Black Diamond Contact strap crampons perfectly (chosen for good overboot fit and lack of technical climbing on the WB),1
5126,Seems like one of the major criticisms of the boots is that they're not very durable~ but since the West Buttress involves no technical climbing or rough terrain I can't comment on that,1
5127,I run hot and took overboots with me but did not need to use them,1
5128,Costco midweight wool hiking socks worked well,1
5129,Not totally sure on the lowest temperature encountered but we saw at least -20F / -30C overnight,1
5130,The lacing~ zippers~ and shell of the boots performed great in the cold,1
5131,I usually stored the shells in the tent vestibule and never had issues taking them off or putting them on.,1
5132,Glenn~ obviously it's hard to say over just hearing your description on the internet~ but it sounds like those are too small for you,1
5133,I find the I am very true-to-size with the G2 SM~ my foot measures exactly 42.5~ and I wear a 42.5 in the boot,1
5134," (""Street shoe"" is kind of hard to say~ most shoes don't fit true to size.) For me at least~ when I have the boots tightened properly~ I do not make contact with the front of the boot during kicks",1
5135,My boot is roomy enough to leave some wiggle room in the toes~ but snug enough to have almost no heel lift if the boas are tight,1
5136,For swelling~ remember that you can always mess with the boas a little bit,1
5137,Regardless of my sock choice~ thin or thick~ the boots fit 100%,1
5138,I wear either Smartwool's PhD Mountaineering or their Mountaineering Extra Heavy socks~ which are almost on the opposite sides of the spectrum thickness wise,1
5139,You should also note that the boots just may not work out for your foot shape~ no matter the size,1
5140,It could be beneficial to also give the Phantom 6000s a shot,1
5141,For me~ it was the opposite,1
5142,No matter what size~ the 6000s resulted in toe bang and/or heel lift.,1
5143,2 things:  1) The upper BOA on my right foot failed in exactly the way that you mentioned,1
5144,Unfortunately while up in Hyalite,1
5145,Seemed off axis~ skipped teeth~ etc,1
5146,I was able to get the dial to mostly tighten by exerting pressure axially while spinning (I pushed the dial down while turning....) but it didn't hold so I had to improvise,1
5147,I know for a fact it broke when I simply tried to crank things down a little too hard,1
5148,I've replaced it ($8) and now I just think about the boot a little differently,1
5149,Basically~ I get them tight~ as tight as I would normally get a lace-up boot~ and nothing more,1
5150,Even though technically the BOA~ unlike a lace-up~ let's me take the tightness to 11~ I only take it to 10,1
5151,Digressing~ it's pretty goddamn Gucci but I love the fact that I can hone in and fiddle so quickly and easily,1
5152,And they are super warm and climb and approach really well,1
5153,For what I'm doing~ cost-benefit still puts these very high in the benefit column,1
5154,2) The digging in that you and others are experiencing is almost certainly due to the velcro closures on the inner boot,1
5155,Quick fix is to secure the lower velcro further towards your toes~ and the upper velcro closure higher up your ankle,1
5156,This creates space between the two velcro closures~ without which there is a pinch point,1
5157,The longer term fix is to actually cut away a few cm from each strap (bottom of the upper strap and top of the lower strap) to create that space,1
5158,Hope that works for you! Credit Brady @ IME for figuring that out,1
5159,I've got the G2s and have only used them once so far on an ascent of Cotopaxi~ Ecuador,1
5160,Got them coz I have bad circulation,1
5161,They held up well~ BUT for the pinching issue~ which was really uncomfortable on steep ascents and forced me to flat foot cross over when I did not really want to,1
5162,I'm trying to work that out right now,1
5163,The inner boot adjustment seems to help a little~ but I also just noticed the position of the inside riveted lace guide seems to be important,1
5164,It seems that both this and the stiff upper can dig into the foot~ it can be rotated to give about a centimetre more/less space~ and I have a feeling that I've had it poorly positioned,1
5165,I'm hoping that this will mostly solve the issue~ but have to try it out properly to check,1
5166,Fingers crossed,1
5167,Which is the before & which is the after photo?,1
5168,I just got back from Banff~ and used the G2 SM the entire time (exception of heading down from the hut),1
5169,Everyone else had leather boots (lowa~ scarpas) and they did fine,1
5170,I was warm the entire time~ and was pleased to not have to stop on gaiters over top of my boot,1
5171,Almost too warm for the conditions I was in~ but while some people - very minor - were complaining about cold feet I had the ideal temp the entire time,1
5172,"  The plastic ankle issue that's been mentioned has gone away mostly after ""breaking in"" the boots~ and although it's still noticeable it isn't a detriment to the adventure",1
5173,I had an amazing time~ and I think the boots are part of the reason I had so much fun,1
5174,They are insanely light~ and wearing almost knee high socks (one pair) worked well for me since I was having some chaffing on my shins,1
5175,Overall~ extremely impressed~ and looking forward to giving them a test run around the white mountains this winter as well.,1
5176,How warm was it in banff lately?,1
5177,How warm was it in banff lately? Rain rain and more god damn rain,1
5178,Temp can be anywhere from just above freezing to way too god damn hot and change in about 3 seconds,1
5179,But such is life in the Canadian rockies.,1
5180,Rain rain and more god damn rain,1
5181,Temp can be anywhere from just above freezing to way too god damn hot and change in about 3 seconds,1
5182,But such is life in the Canadian rockies,1
5183,I know everyone’s feet is different but was just curious what the highest temperature for the g2 would be tolerable,1
5184,I know everyone’s feet is different but was just curious what the highest temperature for the g2 would be tolerable,1
5185,Unless your climbing robson~ I'd leave the g2's at home,1
5186,They would be extremely hot.,1
5187,Unless your climbing robson~ I'd leave the g2's at home,1
5188,They would be extremely hot,1
5189,Got it,1
5190,So anything above 32F/0C is too hot for the G2's lol,1
5191,Got it,1
5192,So anything above 32F/0C is too hot for the G2's lol In my experience anything above -10 is ridiculous in g2's,1
5193,Which is the before & which is the after photo? So~ it's just a rotation of the guide,1
5194,The left image is the guide rotated so that it causes the least pinching (at least as felt trying it in the house!),1
5195,Glad to hear from Peter that there may also be some extra breaking in to look forward to!,1
5196,In my experience anything above -10 is ridiculous in g2's  I've got bad circulation and once my hands/feet have got cold they never seem to warm up again!   I've used them starting around +5 / 10 C and getting down to what I guess was -20C on a night climb to 5700m (Cotapaxi is 5900~ but we got stuck),1
5197,Great for the cold~ a bit too warm as the sun comes out~ but that's ok.,1
5198,I agree and disagree with others,1
5199,My boots were overkill when I was in banff~ but while some people were complaining about cold feet~ I wasn't at all~ ever,1
5200,While it was -5 to + 5 C where I was~ I was still walking through 2 feet of snow and didn't have to worry about boots getting wet or cold the entire time,1
5201,I'll have to take a look at the rotation that Fergus mentioned...but for the weight and warmth factor I'm super happy with my purchase,1
5202,To agree with others these boots are likely overkill when it isn't below zero temps,1
5203,It comes down to personal preference unfortunately in some cases~ and at $800 I can understand starting out with a cheaper pair of boots and working your way up,1
5204," I'm not upset with my boots at all~ but might have to look for a boot that's less ""intense""  if there is more trail than snow and the temp doesn't justify them",1
5205,La sportiva is likely the brand to go with,1
5206,Oh as an aside~ it could just be mental~ but having mine heat molded was a game changer!  The boots definitely started to feel better afterwards~ so i'd recommend having that done,1
5207,HI.....it's a long story but I have a pair of NEW in the BOX~ 44.5 G2SM's that I want to sell,1
5208,Never worn,1
5209,I originally purchased them from La Sportiva when they first came out,1
5210,A trip I had planned was cancelled so I did not use them,1
5211,Then when I had a chance to try on some demos at the Ouray Ice Fest I realized 44 would have been better,1
5212,I tried to get them to just trade me~ but no go,1
5213,So I ended up buying a pair of 44's which I have used many times,1
5214,I am probably going to post them on Gear Trade for $650 with $25 shipping,1
5215,Anyone here interested? Thanks,1
5216,Were you wearing single or double socks?,1
5217,Another idea is to buy a different liner for warmer weather,1
5218,So what are people’s thoughts on the boots durability?  More durable than spantiks?  Better to go with the acrux’s if your concerned about durability? I’ll be using these primarily for multi pitch cold as crap days and high mountains,1
5219,These overkill for alpamayo?,1
5220,I hope these are good for well below -10,1
5221,I climb in my Nepal’s in -10f on a pretty regular basis,1
5222,I'm guessing you have the 3mm ezeefit?,1
5223,I'm guessing you have the 3mm ezeefit? I got the 2mm~ which worked perfectly for me,1
5224,A buddy of mine uses the 3mm and they work well for him,1
5225,Super comfy~ I forget that I even have them on.,1
5226,What kind of insoles are you guys using in your G2SMs?,1
5227,I tried a few different Superfeet (green~ carbon) along with some complete custom ones that were super expensive~ but I ended up having much more success with the boot without using any insoles,1
5228,FWIW~ I used green in a few of my other boots until I got the custom ones.,1
5229,I use Blue SuperFeet for my G2's,1
5230,I haven’t found a chance to try these on~ how do they fit compared to Nepal EVO’s? I wear a 40.5 in my Nepal’s and was thinking about ordering a pair of 40’s in the G2SM,1
5231,I wear the same size in the Nepal Evo and the G2,1
5232,Obviously it could be different per foot~ but hopefully it gives you a starting point!,1
5233,I found them to fit similar with the g2 being a bit more snug.,1
5234,Above 6~000 meters in the Khumbu,1
5235,Toes never got cold,1
5236,Comfortable and light,1
5237,Favorite boot for high alpine and cold winter conditions.,1
5238,I wear the same size in the Nepal Evo and the G2,1
5239,Obviously it could be different per foot~ but hopefully it gives you a starting point!,1
5240,I got the 2mm~ which worked perfectly for me,1
5241,A buddy of mine uses the 3mm and they work well for him,1
5242,Super comfy~ I forget that I even have them on.,1
5243,Bought these boots recently and have been breaking them in on 9 mile round trip treks that include forest trails~ loose rock and skree~ minor scrambling and tundra,1
5244,These boots are amazing,1
5245,Very warm and comfortable,1
5246,The BOA system has worked without a hitch so far,1
5247,Breaking these puppies in for Aconcagua and then Denali,1
5248,I have one issue with pain I'd like to point out and see if any of you had this happen and resolved it,1
5249,On my right foot~ inner ankle (medial melleolus) I'm getting some sharp pain that I can't shake,1
5250,My best guess is that one of the sewing seems runs directly over the peak of the bone and is digging in,1
5251,Only on one boot boot though which I can't figure out,1
5252,Any suggestions? Also~ has anyone heat molded these to their feet yet? Is it worth it?,1
5253,Hi everyone....,1
5254,I have a pair of G2SM's in 44.5 never worn still in the box,1
5255,I purchased them originally direct from La Sportiva,1
5256,I am looking for a buyer $500.00,1
5257,Due to serious back issues my days of carrying a heavier pack are over~ so the boots are just going to sit and collect dust,1
5258,Any thoughts or takers,1
5259,Hey so if you are climbing in the Cascades and doing winter objectives~ the baruntes are ok~ I have them and they are plenty warm,1
5260,But you can definitely get away with a super gaiter single boot and use charmoz's or trangos in the summer,1
5261,The trango tower extreme might be the most ideal cascade boot if you are doing stuff on volcanoes and or mixed climbs with a classic cascades approach.,1
5262,Resurrecting this post! I used these boots on a recent expedition up Elbrus and they were perfect,1
5263,Kept my feet rather warm but still only up to 5500m,1
5264,I'm not sure about the 7000m claim~ but I am planning an attempt at 6500 in Nepal next month,1
5265,Does anyone have experience with these boots at a similar altitude? I don't want to jump to an 8000m boot without need~ especially since I wear a size 49 and I can't rent those.,1
5266,Hey Kevin,1
5267,An acquaintance of mine regularly uses G2SMs up to 7300m on acclimatization rotations on 8000m peaks,1
5268,G2SMs should be more than enough for 6000m peaks,1
5269,Talked to BOA and they sent me two dials~ two 90cm laces and two 60cm laces..,1
5270,fantastic service!,1
5271,Has anyone solved pinch point issues? Any boot liner/boa customization? Boots seems perfect but pinch point issues is the only concern.,1
5272,No but check your soles,1
5273,Some Sportiva workers did not put the matterhorn soles on some boots,1
5274,I'm late to the party but there is no way G2SM is as warm as Baruntse,1
5275,I have both and G2SM cost me a summit this summer,1
5276,Wish I could figure these things out but I don't have a narrow foot,1
5277,its possible you got a bad pair like how I got a pair with the wrong soles on,1
5278,its possible you got a bad pair like how I got a pair with the wrong soles on,1
5279,Which ones are correct~ and what is the difference?,1
5280,I believe they just did this on the larger sizes~ at least that's what I heard from a rep.,1
5281,What companies make cams that fill the in between sizes of BD C4's? Don't say Totems!!! I'm slowly buying a set and I love them but I'm looking to eventually fill the gaps between the 2~ 3~ 4~ and to a lesser extent the 5,1
5282,Totems don't go that big yet,1
5283,I'm sure there is already a thread for this but I've had no luck finding it,1
5284,If you have the link please feel free to share and I'll get this one closed or deleted.,1
5285,Try this site out: https://cam-parison.com/,1
5286,Lots of choices in the small sizes:https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/110669602/cam-comparison-chart,1
5287,In a few instances a 3.5 is handy or even required,1
5288,The new WC Friends are slightly larger than BDs in the #2 and #3 size,1
5289,Or you can find an older Helium/Tech/forged Friend in #4~ which is the same as the older #3.5 Camalot,1
5290,I'm sure some Metolius cams can also fill the gaps~ if buying new,1
5291,I'm just familiar with the 3.5 Camalot and #4 single axle Friends.,1
5292,In my experience~ Metolius cams fall nicely between BD sizes~ at least up to BD #2 (gold),1
5293,Above that it sounds like maybe WC units are the way to go.,1
5294,Any body have any experience and insight on the autoblocking component while lead belaying with the Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device ..,1
5295,"I'd like to get an autoblocking belay device for my girlfriend (more for peace of mind) ~ and reviews make this seem just as good as any ""traditional"" autoblocker..",1
5296,thanks ahead of time for the words of wisdom!,1
5297,The MegaJul is not sold as an autolocking device nor is it certified as such,1
5298,The two UIAA categories are Manual braking device and Locking assisted braking device and the MegaJul is certified as a manual device unlike the Grigri which is Locking assisted (the MegaJul would not pass the dynamic test for sure~ none of this type do).,1
5299,I have it~ bought it for the same reason as you,1
5300,"I have used it with ropes between 10 and 10.5 and it ""assists braking"" every time",1
5301,It does take some getting used to but once you figure it out it is quite nice.,1
5302,I've used the Jul on a 9.6 and I loved it,1
5303,It does take some adjustment to your belay technique,1
5304,Not a huge fan for belaying up the second,1
5305,RichieRich...as with you~ I read the reviews,1
5306,I bought a Mega Jul and love it,1
5307,As Jim indicated it functions much like a GriGri~ but isn't a locking assisted belay device,1
5308,It is light and the manual braking feature is great,1
5309,It does take so getting used to~ but worth the time and $$.,1
5310,I love the device,1
5311,It works a lot better than a Mammut Smart or GriGri for feeding out rope and more dynamic for trad climbing,1
5312,I tested it with my hefty buddy jumping off a climb and it held him every time with very minimum slippage.,1
5313,I have logged about 60+ days on my mega-jul on sport/trad/multipitch rock~ and I feel that it is a very versatile and good device and definitely a 'next step' in belay devices,1
5314,The biggest drawback for me is that if using a rope 10 mm or bigger for 'guide mode' top belaying~ it can give you gnarly belayers elbow because of the really high friction...but with skinnier ropes it's a dream,1
5315,Also i often flip it over when rappelling so that it functions like a standard ATC because even when trying to use a carabiner as a 'handle' for rappelling with it in standard mode~ i still couldn't get it to run smoothly~ and if you just crank on the wire to rappel you can pop it out of the device (again this is on fat ropes)   I'd definitely recommend buying one though~ they're awesome,1
5316,Jim~ thank you for the clarification,1
5317,Everyone~ thank you for the responses~ and I believe the MegaJul is the route we're headed..,1
5318,pun intended,1
5319," As discussed in the thread on the Alpine Up~ the reason the MegaJul can't be certified as an locking assisted device but rather is ""only"" a manual locking device is because it cannot automatically stop a factor-2 fall without the correct manual intervention of the belayer",1
5320,The UIAA test the device would have to pass to get assisted locking certification looks like this:  UIAA test set-up for locking belay devices~ theuiaa.org/upload_area/cer…   and with no brake hand to move the braking strand above the device there will be no braking effect,1
5321,This is the same for all ATC-style devices~ the Mammut Smart and Smart Alpine~ and the Click Up and Alpine Up,1
5322,The UIAA certification thus does not distinguish between the behavior of the ATC-XP and Reverso on the one hand and the more vigorous braking actions of the Smarts~ Ups~ and MegaJuls---they are all lumped together as manual locking devices in spite of the substantial differences between them when it comes to holding non-factor-2 leader falls,1
5323,Personally~ I wouldn't be in a rush to embrace the MegaJul,1
5324,As a counterpoint to the raves here~ I know a handful of people who have tried them and don't like them,1
5325,Its performance appears to depend a great deal on rope diameter and the carabiner that is used~ so it is a bit hard to know what you are actually getting,1
5326,It is known to be hard on carabiners~ and the earlier models had quality-control problems (these may now have been fixed however),1
5327,The primary advantages seem to be light weight~ small size~ and modest price.,1
5328," RGold (Jim Titt~ to you also)~ correct me if I'm wrong but it appears that these tests are performed with the belay device in ""guide mode""",1
5329,In your experience does the rope diameter have that much of an effect if the belayer is lead belaying from below~ and how much slippage would occur if the belayer is not contributing to the system (handsfree) from this position?   Shoo~ she does an excellent job belaying~ however~ being about 70% of my weight~ it makes me a little nervous if I take a hard fall and she goes up into the first draw/piece when anchored below is not a sufficient option.,1
5330,RicheRich~   Don't listen to the armchair engineers who have never personally used the device,1
5331,Listen to climbers and reviewers who have actually used the device,1
5332,Rock and Ice..,1
5333,"  ""I know companies today shy away from the word “auto-locking” but Mega Jul certainly does a great job of braking a fall with very little effort.""   ""The Mega Jul is the lightest~ most versatile and best-performing all-around belay device I’ve ever used—once you get comfortable with it.""   Climbing Magazine.",1
5334,"  ""Climbing Magazine Editor's Choice 2014""",1
5335,If you're not comfortable with her catching you you should spend more time with her instead of getting an auto locking device,1
5336,Made this mistake then just picked up a reverse and spent time with practice falls and problem solved.,1
5337,On climbing forums people commonly post recommendations on gear they have never used and post routes they have never climbed,1
5338,The point is don't take anything you read on a climbing forum as fact,1
5339,Test the gear yourself and decide if it fits your own situation,1
5340,There are lots of self-proclaimed expert engineers and people with 100 years of climbing experience on here that will give you untested opinion which may or may not be relevant for your unique situation.,1
5341,Background: My wife bought me one for my birthday,1
5342,I was following the old thread where the wire kept pulling out~ but was hesitant to get one because of this,1
5343,It appears quality control in the early batches has been corrected now,1
5344,For the first few days climbing with it I carried by trusty Reverso 4 because I didn't trust  the new device yet,1
5345,Multiple days of cragging and multipitch has made me a believer,1
5346,The device catches falls nearly on its own,1
5347,In guide mode with my 9.5 or 9.4 it works great,1
5348,If someone is hang dogging~ it locks up and stays right there,1
5349,The climber doesn't slowly creep down because you moved your hand an inch,1
5350,On twin ropes (~8.2 I think) it was effortless to belay in regular and guide mode~ but still locked up nicely,1
5351,Flipping it around (non locking mode) works great for faster raps (feels like a normal ATC)~ but if you are untangling rope that didn't get tossed perfectly~ the locking mode is really nice (although a bit jerky for rappel) because you can be a bit more hands free to deal with a cluster (probably should still back up though),1
5352,It top ropes fine~ and lead belay is awesome,1
5353,Additionally since it is made of steel rather than aluminum it doesn't heat up as much and should last longer than most other devices,1
5354,I didn't pay for it but would gladly buy another,1
5355,Also people keep comparing it to a GriGri,1
5356,It is nothing like a GriGri,1
5357,It is cheaper~ allows you to rappel on it~ weighs less~ and has no moving parts to get stuck,1
5358,Teach your girlfriend to belay with an ATC and you will be happier in the long run~ but this will be a nice assist device to help her catch your whippers,1
5359,IMO,1
5360,couple quick points...at a rock gym here in boulder~ every single (as of a couple years back) groundfall they'd had~ had been with a GriGri...just fyi,1
5361,the wire issue has indeed been fixed on the megajul,1
5362,flip the unit around when rappelling (thumb loop/wire facing you~ instead of away~ as when lead-belaying) and it rappels just fine,1
5363,i've used everything from 8.7 single to 10.0...,1
5364,"  as for using skinnier ropes when belaying a second to avoid ""belayer's elbow~"" be extremely careful when using skinnier cords",1
5365,under the right (wrong) circumstances~ the rope can flip (meaning the climber's strand ends up on the bottom~ not the top) and then things get interesting quick,1
5366,now--a GiGi or even ATC/Reverso can do the same thing~ so it's not a design flaw~ but rather an issue one should be aware of when belaying a single follower,1
5367,more on this~ including video and input from an IFMGA guide here: elevationoutdoors.com/blogs…   and lastly~ i'd agree with the poster regarding more time spent coaching/practicing~ too,1
5368,technique is key; the megajul a nice backup in things go sideways~ for whatever reason,1
5369,i personally like the megajul~ my only gripe being autoblocking/belaying a single follower issue (see above link).....,1
5370,good luck!,1
5371,Well I prised myself out of my armchair a few years ago and built maybe 50 different prototypes of this kind of plate~ in the end we made an adjustable jig so we could move the two rope contact points about and vary the wedging ange of the karabiner,1
5372,I never got better results than a conventional plate so we shelved the idea when I ran off the development budget,1
5373,The problem here is it´s a very fine balance how far onto the bottom contact point the karabiner goes as naturally the rope tries to force it back and the only force available is from the position of the top contact point and the angle of the wedging face,1
5374,Basically the karabiner has to end up half-way on top of the lower entry radius and so compared with a conventional plate or tube type device the karabiner has to be much further into the device so the rope bends around the karabiner and the plate entry exit are considerably smaller,1
5375,Since most of the braking power comes from the bends the power is lost,1
5376,For an ATC XP the entry angle is around 90°~ the karabiner wrap 140° and the exit angle 45°~ for the MegaJul the numbers are approximately 30°~ 100° and 20°and with a thinner rope and under full tension probably lower still~ I shall have to measure this more exactly sometime,1
5377,Camp tried to increase the pressure between the karabiner and the bottom pin by adding a Vee slot to the upper exit when they made the YoYo but whether it worked I´ve no idea!   The Alpine Up has a little nose that drives under the karabiner which is a good idea EXCEPT it makes releasing under tension even harder~ a handling balancing act all this type have anyway~ ten years ago nobody would have accepted a belay device where you need to use a karabiner to lever it open to lower or abseil and many of us still don´t feel this is progress,1
5378,It´s the sheer depth of things like the ATC XP which makes them work so well and why tube type devices are so good~ the Reverso³ ought to be better looking at the slot design but shaving the height makes it actually a worse performer.,1
5379,This is exactly the theoretical mathematical bullshit I'm talking about,1
5380,Go out to your local sport crag where your partner is going to fall a lot and actually use a MegaJul,1
5381,It will autolock and catch your falling leader every time,1
5382,I've actually used the device for a couple of months now and that is my real life experience with the device,1
5383,I don't know the exit or entry angle,1
5384,I don't really care,1
5385,It caught the leader every time on some pretty big whippers,1
5386,That is what you should care about,1
5387,Is it fool-proof? No,1
5388,No device is but if your belayer is inattentive or gets hit in the head with a rock it is a nice to have an auto-locking/assisted-locking device instead of the rope screaming uncontrolled through the ATC,1
5389,I want to see an old man cage fight to settle this..,1
5390,I didn't read this whole thread~ but just in case the OP didn't see this~ there is some useful information~ cheers!! elena_review,1
5391," Jim~     I'm wondering if you have data that can correlate effectiveness of the ""locking assist"" vs fall factors",1
5392,And how does this data compare to ATC Guide and Reverso 3?  I think this may be valuable,1
5393,Yes~ high fall factor falls do happen,1
5394,But~ how does this device perform for climbers that understand and are able to practically eliminate high fall factors,1
5395,Also~ any device that slips~ negates the theoretic fall factor 2,1
5396,Perhaps this slippage leads to a 1.9 or 1.8 or lower,1
5397,I can't say for sure~ which is still a very high fall factor.,1
5398,RichieRich,1
5399,If you're speaking only of single pitch climbing~ a GriGri is probably a far better alternative,1
5400,I actually use a GriGri for all of my cragging and sport climbing,1
5401,For multi-pitch climbing though the MegaJul is hard to beat,1
5402,Its light,1
5403,It has never failed to lock for me(with ropes from 8m doubles and 9.3 - 9.8 singles),1
5404,Using it in guide mode with ropes 9.8 and under is really not much different than an ATC or similar,1
5405,Last but not least~ using it in Tuber mode has always worked perfectly for me on multiple rappels,1
5406,I'm using it with a BD Mini-Pearbiner.,1
5407,Only on a climbing forum can you make a recommendation on a piece of gear that you have never personally used,1
5408,That is total bullshit~ like it or not.,1
5409,I think before we leave this fecally infected thread~ a bit of review is in order,1
5410,What I wrote way back when was,1
5411,For others interested in this~ Jim hasn’t got (or at least hasn’t shared) a mathematical model of assisted braking belay device performance,1
5412,I don’t think reboot’s works for a number of reasons~ but that discussion isn’t relevant here because we are not debating  mathematical models,1
5413,Jim has some load measurements and some physical explanations in terms of rope angles in the devices,1
5414,He is~ I believe~ using the term power the way reboot has used efficiency~ i.e,1
5415,how much the device multiplies the applied hand force,1
5416,His tests so far suggest that at high loads~ the tested assisted-locking devices actually have a lower hand-force multiplication factor then an ATC-XP,1
5417,My understanding—which may be all wrong in which case Jim will~ in the fullness of time~ correct it—is that the assisted locking action can occur before the carabiner travels all the way to its highest possible position in the slot,1
5418,If this happens~ and if the load increases enough~  the carabiner is pulled further up~ which decreases various rope bend angles and so decreases the “power” of the device,1
5419,Perhaps it isn’t simply a question of carabiner position up or down the slot but also a question of the angle of the belay device under increasing loads~ and perhaps both of these possibilities work in concert,1
5420,The consequences of all this aren’t clear to me at the moment,1
5421,I don’t know whether Jim has taken static measurements at an increasing range of loads or somehow studied the dynamics of the device behavior under high fall-factors,1
5422,I don’t know how much the decreases in “power” might actually matter,1
5423,If they do matter~ I don’t know what the comparison is between rope run through an ATC and rope run through an assisted locking device for high fall factors,1
5424,The assisted-locking feature might force the rope to absorb more fall energy before running and so lead to less rope running through the device when it does run~  even though the power of the device is less at that point,1
5425,Or~ on the other hand~ the rope running after a momentary apparent locking could be a surprise that causes the belayer to lose control,1
5426,Most of us think of a belay device as a simple gadget that adds friction and so multiplies grip strength by some constant,1
5427,Indeed~ quite a few papers have been written on belay dynamics include this assumption,1
5428,But as the devices get more complicated~ this assumption may no longer be valid~ if it ever was~ and this is what Jim’s results so far are suggesting,1
5429,Whether those results have practical consequences for adopting such devices~ and/or whether those results inform the way the devices are employed~ remains to be seen.,1
5430,the mammut smart (and alpine smart) is NOT autolocking ..,1
5431,it provides an assisted lock ..,1
5432,you treat it like an ATC+ and always keep your hand on the brake (which you should with a gri gri as well)   it can and will slip should the rope be thin enough~ new and slick enough~ etc ..,1
5433,on a single line rap on a mammut 9.5 or beal 9~7 it does slip ...,1
5434,"  on falls it locks most of the time~ but there will be times when it does slip   IMO on ""normal"" falls its provides more breaking power than an ATC ..",1
5435,and on a 10mm rope which i use for most things it locks more reliably   i own and use all versions of the smart extensively every day   ive used the megajul somewhat when my partners have em ..,1
5436,it feeds and works around the same as the smart IMO ..,1
5437,but rapping on the assisted mode is a biatch without unless you use that biner as lever   and the autoblock is a biatch on anything approaching 10mm ropes   the alpine smart pulls through the device in autoblock like buttah   i havent had the opportunity to test either in high factor falls on real rock ..,1
5438,thank god   but i would definitely like to see the actual data on these braking device on such falls   ;),1
5439,Jim~ thanks for posing up all the info,1
5440,I really appreciate it,1
5441," Just to make sure that I am clear~ you are saying that the Jul / Smart will hold a ""small"" fall with less hand force from the belayer that an ATC",1
5442," However~ an ATC will hold a ""bigger"" fall with less hand force from the belayer that a Jul / Smart",1
5443,Is this accurate?  Also~ do you know at what point the Jul / Smart requires more hand force that an ATC?   In my experience with the Smart~ the exit angle of the rope from the device makes a big difference in the amount of hand force from the belayer that is required,1
5444,If directly under the first piece~ less hand force from the belayer is required,1
5445,The greater the angle between the belayer and the first piece~ the greater the amount of  hand force from the belayer that is required,1
5446,Edit to add..,1
5447,performance in factor 2 falls is not something that I am concerned about,1
5448,I set up belays so that a Factor 2 is a VERY low probability,1
5449,I always have the rope running through a piece above me~ so a factor 1.9? is about as big as I will ever need to hold,1
5450,If I am worried about a true factor 2 (which is virtually never)~ I will use a grigri,1
5451,My concern is generating stopping power where the direction of pull is up.,1
5452,The deeper a hole Brian digs himself~ the more I enjoy this thread,1
5453,Brian - do you have any idea of the background and knowledge of the individuals with whom you're rapidly losing an argument?   Richard and Jim - thank you for your tireless and timeless contributions to the climbing world,1
5454,Your posts here are always valued and appreciated.,1
5455," I was assuming that the ""assisted locking"" devices would at least have the good grace to begin slipping at higher loads than the ATC",1
5456,If that turns out not to be true I guess I'll be shelving some very expensive gadgets...,1
5457,On further inspection the reason the locking force doesn´t increase with an increasing load has nothing to do with rope dynamics or anything technical~ the karabiner is physically unable to move nearer the pressure point,1
5458,On the MegaJul it stops leaving an eye shaped hole 6mm high and more or less as wide as the slot~ on the Smart it´s bigger so it´s just a matter of how much effort it takes to pull a rope through a hole this big,1
5459,There´s a reason that both Edelrid and Mammut have to make different plates for larger and smaller ropes.,1
5460,This is a fascinating and slightly troubling discussion,1
5461,"   If I understand correctly~ in a ""traditional"" ATC device (paired with a particular rope and caribiner)~ the amount of friction created is fairly constant~ created by large bends in the rope",1
5462,"The ""slippage point"" is reached when the forces in the fall are great enough to overcome the combined friction in the system and grip strength of the belayer",1
5463,"  On an ""assisted braking"" device - the Smarts and Juls - there is actually a change in the amount of friction that depends on the interaction between the biner~ device and rope",1
5464,As the rope pulls~ the biner is forced into a position that pinches the rope between the device and the biner~ and increases the bends int he rope,1
5465,However~ theoretically (but not yet tested)~ a large and sudden enough force can cause the device to fail to engage in a way that the friction is minimized rather than maximized,1
5466,Similar to the problem that the Cinch had when it did not engage at high factor falls,1
5467,Am I getting this right?,1
5468," I just tried to explain~ perhaps incorrectly but surely not all that unclearly~ that what Jim is saying does not necessarily mean the rope will go ""streaming through the MegaJul.""   There are plenty of people out there who will tell you the rope doesn't run through a ATC either in their experience~ but there is no question at this point that it will in a big fall with high fall-factor and little system friction",1
5469," One of the problems with these discussions is the difference~ already present before ""assisted locking"" devices entered the picture~ between the behavior of belay devices in ""ordinary"" circumstances and ""extreme"" circumstances",1
5470," Most folks have never had to deal with an ""extreme"" circumstance and end up claiming the device behavior associated with such circumstances doesn't happen",1
5471,"  The situation with ""assisted lockers"" is further muddied by the fact that they are new and so experience from the field~ is even less likely to have exposed issues and anomalies",1
5472,"  By the way~ I say all this as someone who has used and promoted ""assisted locking"" devices (I use the Alpine Up) for about two years now.",1
5473,I thought my megajul was awesome~ after reading this thread I am tossing all of my tube style devices ( except for my Toucan ) and using a munter exclusively.,1
5474,Jim~ pardon my ignorance of your testing method~ but I assume that these results are from a static measure of grip force vs the load on the climber end,1
5475,Do you have any testing planned to show the grip strength requirements during a dymanic test (say a given falling mass~ height and FF) by belay device and the associated slippage?,1
5476,Jim~   Your chart maybe suggests that they need to add some cleats to the brake side of the megajul like the BD and Reverso devices?,1
5477," So basically these assisted locking devices are no worse than a reverso~ and generally better with lesser grip strength?   I will say that with my alpine smart the initial lock off on ""normal whippers"" is MUCH better than an atc guide (which i also use extensively) ..",1
5478,And on 10mm+ ropes locks pretty well   Ill take that and the butter smooth autoblock anyways   Ive always maintained that folks should be very proficient with a tube device before moving to any assisted locking device~ including the grigri   The emphasis on brake hand control regardless of device is one of the most important things in climbing   ;),1
5479,One thing those numbers suggest is that you cannot count on the MegaJul as a locking rappel device for a single strand rappel on a 9mm rope~ especially near the end of a rappel with little rope weight on it~ because with zero or near zero grip strength (i.e,1
5480,you've let go of the rope)~ the thing starts to slip at about 70 kgf = 154 lbf,1
5481,The Smart would be even worse~ with an untended slip threshold of about 40 kgf = 88 lbf,1
5482,"  Jim pointed out to me in another thread that the instructions for the Alpine Up warn not to use it in ""autolocking mode"" for single-strand rappels; I'm beginning to see why that is.",1
5483,I think I have learned a lot from this thread,1
5484,However~ not being a physicist and having had trouble with the few applied physics classes I took many years ago~ I am not sure that I am understanding the real world ramifications of the data that Jim posted,1
5485,With that in mind~ can one of you smart guys (Rgold or Jim) answer a few questions for me?   The graph shows that a fall generating ~150KG of force on the belay will require ~22KG of had force to stop when using a Smart / Jul,1
5486,If one tried to catch a fall that generated 170KG of force on the belay with ~22KG of had force~ would the rope slip a little bit and then stop as the force dissipated~ or would the rope continue to slip and the belayer be completely unable to stop the fall?   I don't use a GriGri for trad because of the higher impact forces it generates,1
5487,Assuming that the Smart / Jul will only slip a limited amount before stopping~ wouldn't the slip actually beneficial in certain circumstances where you are climbing above marginal gear and want a soft catch?   Thanks to all the posters that have contributed to this conversation,1
5488,Cheers!,1
5489,Thank you for the very comprehensive response,1
5490,Ha! Don´t want a MegaJul then~ the instructions specifically exclude palm-up (unless you´ve some wierd hands)~ gotta have the braking hand thumb pointing toward the device,1
5491,Says you´ll have a fatal accident:-),1
5492,In any case~ the Alpine Smart and MegaJul~ whatever their good points~ are just plain inferior to the Alpine Up when it comes to half-rope handling~ and since  I use half ropes almost all the time~ the Smart and Jul~ and anything else that ties up the brake hand the way they do~ are never going to be the device of choice for me.,1
5493," I'm sure it ""works fine~"" just not as well as the Alpine Up",1
5494,Look~ there's a handle on the Smart and Jul because~ in at least some circumstances~ pumping slack to the leader requires the device be levered away from the belayer's body to keep the device from grabbing,1
5495,With half ropes and the fairly common need to take one in while paying one out~ tying up the brake hand on that handle means the other hand has to be pumping one strand and switching over and around to take in the other strand,1
5496,This is at the very best awkward~ and is prone to leave more slack in the leader's ropes~ resulting~ in some cases~ in an elimination of one of the advantages of half rope technique,1
5497,When you have only one rope to manage~ fine~ but with two ropes heading through the device in opposite directions~ the Alpine Up~ which doesn't restrict what the belayer can do with their hands~ is simply a better solution,1
5498,I sure do wish I know what the force curves for it look like though...,1
5499,i never had any real problems belaying or rapping with my alpine smart on mammut 8mm halves   once the climber clips high a simply feed a bit of slack on the lower clipped roped then bring in the higher clipped rope which is the critical one   for rapping i found it little different from the version of the smart for thicker ropes~ requiring very little effort to keep control ..,1
5500,but then im very used to the smart by now   a few things worth mentioning   - the slippage in the smart is a good thing for trad climbing IMO ..,1
5501,especially if you are on smaller gear   - the particular biner makes a decent difference in the braking and feeding of the alpine smart IME ..,1
5502,a flatter profile biner like a rocklock gives is stickier than a rounder one like a william/boa   - the alpine smart is a biatch to release in autoblock ..,1
5503,its probably one of the hardest devices to do so once loaded requiring a thin dyneema sling or cord ..,1
5504,"and you cant do the biner pump which complicates self rescue scenarios   - the alpine smart can be used in a ""normal"" rapping mode ..",1
5505,but you cant bump it up like an ATC ..,1
5506,line a biner brake it only goes one way ..,1
5507,down   - the smoothness in autoblock means the alpine smart makes a great emergency ascender~ especially on double strand raps should you screw up your rap   - it is critical with the smart that the brake hand come down onto the rope  and not keep hold of the handle when a fall occurs ...,1
5508,folks have been dropped by holding onto the handle with minimal grip on the rope~ and levering up the handle slightly   one thing id like to know about these assisted locking devices is how much the greater initial braking has on the fall itself ..,1
5509,with a grigri your body basically gets pulled up right away (im sure there is some slippage in large falls~ but essentially you just get pulled up) ..,1
5510,with an ATC/munter theres an inertial phase where your hand moves up first~ as anyone who has had their hand sucked upwards can attest to   with these assisted locking devices does the higher initial braking force of the fall have any effect on holding the fall afterwards ..,1
5511,"does it make it less likely to lose control vs a munter/ATC where  the peak force occurs since there is no/not as much moving hand ""inertial phase"" ..",1
5512,or does it make it more likely to lose control  A Simulation of Climbing  and Rescue Belays    basically i think someone needs to go out an catch a whole bunch of UIAA factor 1~77 falls on a high speed camera ...,1
5513,which im sure mammut and edelrid have already done   perhaps we should ask em ..,1
5514,;),1
5515,There a bit shy about actually publishing any real results for their belay devices~ something most manufacturers are guilty of,1
5516,Us Smart users will just have to accept;- By “braking force support” we mean that in a fall the device exerts most of the braking action itself~ virtually locking the device,1
5517,The shape and geometry of the Smart Alpine provides dynamic braking of the rope in order to minimize impact on the fallen climber and the equipment~ so the belayer only needs to apply a small amount of force to lock the rope completely in the belay device,1
5518,It is true that the Smart Alpine is designed to exert an enormous braking effect on the rope~ virtually locking it....,1
5519,Or not.,1
5520,jim~   what biner did you use to test the alpine smart?,1
5521,An old-school Petzl Attache~ climbing I use the Climbing Technology one but I´m not going to waste that testing! They´re virtually identical anyway just the cT one has a clip for the belay loop to stop rotating.,1
5522,might be interesting to try it with the BD rocklock if you have one   i find a rocklock is more sticky on thinner ropes ...,1
5523,though its harder to feed and rappel on with thicker ropes   as you can see the gap is significant and noticeable on belay/rap bd rocklock~ thin rope alpine smart version  petzl attache~ thin rope alpine smart version,1
5524,I'm not liking the underhand brake strand grip they show in the BRD manual,1
5525,metoliusclimbing.com/pdf/BR…   I wonder if metolius will make a plaquette/guide mode version?,1
5526,Twin/Half 7.8mm ropes~ each strand loaded with half the hand force,1
5527,All devices rated for these ropes,1
5528,7.8mm   Incidentally don´t imagine you can actually grip these ropes with 24kg hand force~ if you can get half your doing well.,1
5529,i find it absolutely interesting that the BRD and megajul perform much worse relative to the others with ~8mm twin ropes vs,1
5530,a single ~9mm   hmmmmmmm,1
5531,Maybe I missed it but are you using the small size Alpine Smart with the 7.8mm twins and large size Alpine Smart with the 9mm single?,1
5532,Well it´s partly because this is an ongoing conversation and I´ve previously said that 9~5´s were the biggest rope the Samrt would take and that it was rated for the 7.8´s so I thought it was reasonably clear it could only be the smaller version,1
5533,It´s Mammut´s fault for calling both plates the same thing!,1
5534,And then 8.5mm half ropes,1
5535,8.5mm   Curious that the 7.8´s worked better in the ATC and Reverso so had a closer look~ the 7.8´s a much newer and softer and appear to go down into the vee slots better whereas the 8.5 is a fairly old-school and extremely robust object~ it´s hardness seems to prevent jamming down into the Vee as well,1
5536,And why is any of this interesting? Well if you are using half ropes you often get in the situation where only one strand is actually going to be loaded in a fall and the original objective was to find out how well we can grip two strands when only one is loaded,1
5537,The Italian Alpine Club and hazarded an opinion of about 40% reduction in braking force but didn´t really test it as such~ just noted it when doing some other testing,1
5538,I went a bit further and tried to see what I could hold leaving slack in one strand and then as it slid through seeing what the two-strand force was,1
5539,The reason for purchasing the Smart was in the hope it would improve matters!   The test is of nescessity not very accurate~ there are limits to how much rope sliding through my hand I enjoy,1
5540,That´s also why the BRD and Reverso³ don´t get included,1
5541,Two strand hand gripping   The 7.8 results are particularly poor~ partly because the ropes are reasonably new and still smeared with some slippery stuff in case I was ever stupid enough to go climbing in the wet and cold and partly because I have strong but large hands~ someone smaller might be able to grip the things better.,1
5542,Thanks for posting this jim   Ive always found that stiff ropes feed much better through an atc guide than soft supple one~ the stiffness keeps the it from locking up as fast   Conversely a stiff rope locks up very quickly in a smart~ and is a biatch to feed   Some of my ropes i start off with the smart and after a few hundred pitches of use~ i use an atc as it gets stiffer~ thicker and fuzzy like a bear   What concerns me is not the devices themselves ..,1
5543,"The will all do their jobs if you have a solid brake hand   But rather the promotion of them as ""autolocking"" by the climbing media and folks who recommend em as such   Heres an example outdoorgearlab.com/Belay-De…   Use the smart enough on different ropes and situations and one figures out that while it may lock sometimes~ this is depends on the situation   Over and over again i see newer climbers use such devices (and grigris) as substitute for proper braking control   And even experienced climbers get lazy when using assisted locking devices   I should probably write something up on the failure modes of the smart and the habits of the folks who use em   ;)",1
5544,What differences had you guys found between a Reverso 3 and 4 models?,1
5545,I've seen the new Jul~~~people seem to like it....haven't tried it myself,1
5546,The alpine version of the Smart is nice too~ pretty good for some thinner ropes,1
5547,Also I have an old (4 years?) MadRock device that has a removable piece that allows it to handle fatter ropes~ or when inserted does a great job with controlling even a 9.1 rope I just got,1
5548,So many choices out there~~~I use 'em all for different ropes in use.,1
5549,Jim~    The Mega Jul can be used in either of 2 direcions - as an auto locker or like an ATC,1
5550,Which way was it used in the test?  It's also VERY dependent on the type of biner.,1
5551," It is obvious from Jim's description~ comments~ and graphs that the Jul was used in it's ""autolocking"" (ha!) orientation",1
5552,On the issue of poor performance with 7.8's~ I think this highlights the comments I've been making for a long time now (based~ however~ not on real testing but just personal experience in the field) that manufacturers give overly optimistic usable ranges for their devices and we'd all be well-advised to stick to something like the middle third of those ranges,1
5553,The result is that if you use ropes of significantly varying diameters~ you really shouldn't be trying to use a single device for all of them.,1
5554,TL;DR   Does it hold falls? Is it easy to use?,1
5555,While I appreciate the discussion and have found it to be very interesting~ I have nothing but praise for this device,1
5556,I am happy with how its performed for me in many settings,1
5557,I have used it extensively sport climbing in Greece and Turkey for over a month catching many falls and easily lowering on a 9.5 Edelweiss Energy,1
5558,It always locked and performed as advertised,1
5559,As I got better using it~ it became even easier to use,1
5560,I've used it with a 9.3 and a 9.8 Mammut rope on trad climbing routes extensively as well,1
5561,Its always worked very well and has consistently caught falls,1
5562,It has worked very well climbing alpine multipitch and long multipitch in Red Rock with a set of 8.2 Mammut Double Ropes,1
5563,It caught a long fall on a single strand of those doubles with no issue,1
5564," I have rappelled with it ""backwards"" on many pitches using a backup and it has performed flawlessly",1
5565,I have used it in guide mode on Multipitch climbs on many occasions with all the ropes listed and it has always worked no problem,1
5566,I know several other folks that I've run into in the field~ who have made similar comments,1
5567,I have also run into a few folks that have commented that they didn't like it early into their adoption of the Jul and went back to an ATC or other device,1
5568,"   That said~ I'm not hearing from many people other than ""I know a guy who knows a guy"" type stories of the device performing other than advertised",1
5569,I find Weston's question appropriate,1
5570,Does it hold falls and is it easy to use?  In my and many others experience it does and it is,1
5571,although there can be a learning curve,1
5572,I've heard no direct reports from someone saying it didn't hold a fall.,1
5573,folks ..,1
5574,first of all Jim's tests who that generally the alpine smart is generally no worse than the reverso3 and in certain situations better ..,1
5575,no one is going to stop using their reversos because of these tests~ nor should they   here jims tests again  Hand Force/belay Force 9mm rope,1
5576,7.8mm  8.5mm   the other thing is that we~ on da intrawebz~ really dont know how the devices AND belayers behave in real world large falls ..,1
5577,sure we know from Jim's test they slip at a certain point ...,1
5578,"  however they dont have an ""inertial"" phase where the hand moves up towards the device when braking ...",1
5579,in the case of the smart the hand should move DOWN onto the rope fully   how much of the impact force is absorbed by the initial braking  is unknown  ..,1
5580,youll notice that with a hand belay method (munter~ ATC) the maximum force occurs at the when the hand actually starts grabbing the rope ..,1
5581,with the smart the rope is grabbed to a certain extent from the get go ..,1
5582,A Simulation of Climbing  and Rescue Belays    until some body comes out and tests it with belayers in the system for high factor falls and publishes the results we wont really know   Jims tests are valuable in that they reinforce the point that NONE of these devices are hands free and should not be treated a such..,1
5583,even if they do lock in certain circumstances   but the smart anyways will do its job if you do yours ..,1
5584,"it just isnt a ""hands free"" device ..",1
5585,no commercial climbing device is  hands free on a smart with 10mm tendon smart rope ..,1
5586,not recommended without backup   what one should worry about is not so much the devices themselves ..,1
5587,but the belayers and the folks who promote them as substitute for basic belaying skills and proper brake control (with gri gris as well)   ;),1
5588,Jim~   Thanks for the great tests and data,1
5589,Is there a way to superimpose fall forces onto your graphs so we can get a better ideal of how these results correlate to the real world?   I realize fall forces vary greatly with the factors involved including climber weight~ belayer weight~ fall factors and much more,1
5590,But~ perhaps using an 80 kg climber and an anchored belayer with varying fall factors for a simplified view,1
5591,"  From your graphs~ it appears most devices~ with most ropes are more than adequate (simplified conclusion) with single pitch and ""Unanchored"" belayers since the belay holding force only needs to be greater than the belayers weight since the belayer will be airborne if the force required to arrest the fall exceeds their body weight~ whether this is desirable or not",1
5592,"  So~ this discussion really pertains to a multi pitch scenario where high fall factors or an ""anchored"" belay exists",1
5593,Furthermore~ factor 2 is not really relevant since the rope slips in all of these devices making the factor 2 impossible,1
5594,For example~ a leader 5 feet above the belay falls 10 feet on 5 feet of rope:  10/5= ff 2,1
5595,But~ only 1 foot of rope slippage through the device yields:  11/6= ff 1.8,1
5596,"Although 1.8 is still very high and should be avoided at all costs~ the mythical ff 2 does not really exist with devices the have ""slippage"".",1
5597,Greg~ once the rope slips through the belay device under tension~ the entire fall-factor construction is no longer appropriate for discussing peak loads and it is of no theoretical~ much less practical use,1
5598,You can think of the fall factor as being related to what the peak load would be without such slippage~ but that's as far as it goes,1
5599,(The fall factor is still relevant if you just put a certain amount of slack in the rope~ however.)  Because of the relationship between fall factor and peak loads~ we do know that the likelihood of rope slippage goes up as the fall factor goes up,1
5600,"  In most discussions~ ""fall factor 2"" is a shorthand for a fall the belayer has to hold without the rope running through any intermediate protection",1
5601,As far as peak loads are concerned~ there is hardly any difference between fall factor 2 and~ say~ fall factor 1.8 anyway.,1
5602,rgold~ thanks for that reply and I understand,1
5603,Ignoring my comments about fall factors~ I still would like to see fall forces laid over these graphs to put it in perspective,1
5604,For example~ a 100 kg belay force can only resist a 100 kg fall is there is zero friction between belayer and climber,1
5605,But~ as soon as you introduce points of protection between belayer and cimber and friction on biners and over the rock~ a 100 kg belay force can arrest a higher fall force.,1
5606,I might add~ as I think I mentioned earlier~ that the 1-1.5 m of slip~ if that's what you can keep it to~ is going to go through yer hand in a bit more than 1/4 of second~ in other words~ it is going to happen fast.,1
5607,just a thought ..,1
5608,has anyone asked mammut and edelrid for comment?   if no one else is willing~ ill email mammut over the weekend   ;),1
5609,so jim   then pages 23-29 from this are bunk and disproven? A Simulation of Climbing    and Rescue Belays -2006 International Technical Rescue Symposium CMT Conclusions on Belaying    •Hand acts as an inertial load for the first few hundred    milliseconds,1
5610,•Slip distance is proportional to fall height~ not fall factor,1
5611,Confirmed,1
5612,•Peak force occurs at maximum hand acceleration~ not    at lowest climber position,1
5613,•Only a small amount of belayer lifting is helpful (~20    cm),1
5614,More lifting increases fall distance and does not    decrease peak force,1
5615,Confirmed,1
5616,user.xmission.com/~tmoyer/t…   as a side note we DO hear about folks jamming their hands in belay plates in large falls ..,1
5617,thats one way to lose control~ have the webbing of your hand pulled up into the device and let go for inexperienced climbers   which is why experienced belayers have enough separation between the ATC and their hand,1
5618," One should always have your break hand on the rope when belaying~ so the fact that the Edelrid Mega Jul isn't certified for Factor 2 falls in ""assisted braking"" (eg",1
5619,hands free) mode is rather meritless,1
5620,Get a Mega Jul....they're great belay devices.,1
5621,I'm curious Brian~ you have a vested interest in the MegaJul? Because your personal attacks have seemed to be directed at those who question its use,1
5622,"   Before you reacted to Jim's statement about his and Richard's experience and went off spewing:   ""There are lots of self-proclaimed expert engineers and people with 100 years of climbing experience on here that will give you untested opinion which may or may not be relevant for your unique situation.""   You might want to figure out who those two guys are and just what their qualifications and experience are",1
5623,You might find they actually know a boat load about what they're talking about,1
5624,In Jim's case~ quite literally,1
5625,need another hint? www128.pair.com/r3d4k7/Gold…   The point is not that one doesn't debate with the experts but that if you are going to step into the debate~ you do so with some meaningful contribution,1
5626,And spew against competent~ experienced climbers with backgrounds in engineering and mathematics isn't meaningful,1
5627,Nor is a test with a sample set of 1 where your buddy jumps off the cliff and wow~ you held the fall,1
5628,Too many degrees of freedom there Brian,1
5629,Your observations of your experience with the device are possibly meaningful to the OP,1
5630,That's for them to decide~ to take it or leave it,1
5631,But in terms of attacking the integrity and knowledge of others~ it just doesn't cut it,1
5632,It gets you called out with the age old cry of BS,1
5633,Doesn't really help your case either to make a false statement about armchair engineers and then indicate you can't follow the charts and graphs.,1
5634,It is true that Jim and I have some expertise in both climbing and the technical issues involved in equipment decisions,1
5635,As Brian has been very quick to note~ that by itself doesn't mean one should believe anything we say,1
5636,Our separate professional fields both demand that claims be justified with clearly logical arguments and/or data given with enough information to allow others to reproduce the experiment~ and I think both of us have honored those requirements here---most especially Jim~ who has been more than generous in sharing his results---even though  MP is about as far from a professional environment as it is possible to get,1
5637,If my thinking is faulty~ I've done my best to give you the basis for my conclusions and so the means for explaining why I've gone wrong,1
5638,I think Jim has had to correct me several times in this thread~ for example,1
5639," I also do my best to never play the ""I'm an expert so you have to believe me"" card---I certainly never consciously make this assertion~ even when I am in some sense an expert (which would not be in this discussion)~ because I don't believe it",1
5640,I also really try to avoid the ad hominen attacks and straw man arguments that turn up the temperature while muddying the discussion~ but of course there is no way to prevent others from doing this and it is part of the sport of internet posting~ to the amusement of some but the detriment of understanding anything important.,1
5641,But we know this already~ that is why belay devices are not included in the PPE legislation and receive no CE marking,1
5642,They require human intervention to function and this is outside of the remit of the European Norms which are industrial standards,1
5643,We can however measure the relative strength of the holding power of different devices and measure the capabilities of a broad section of the climbing community to achieve a reasonable picture of under which circumstances and with which device most belayers are capable of holding a fall without injury,1
5644,You can do what you like with this information.,1
5645," well the grigri is one of the better tested ""locking"" devices on the market .",1
5646,yet folks get dropped with em all the time   ;),1
5647,I own one as well Brian,1
5648,In the 41 years I've been at this~ as a gear whore I may have owned most of the devices ever produced (I'd even paid for the last DMM ATC style model Jim designed that was never produced),1
5649,And I have even worn some of them out (no big feat for the origonal reverso),1
5650,"What Jim and Rich say is right on the money~ however I would add that once you factor in ""ease of use""~ for me~ that is the nail in the coffin for why the Megajul is a waste of scratch",1
5651,There is no function the Edelrid has which is not better served by many other devices and that's why it's not worth buying,1
5652,Except looks,1
5653,I love the way it looks,1
5654,But that's pretty much it,1
5655,If you like it~ good for you,1
5656,Around here~ you'd be in a minority.,1
5657," ""The only issue I have with it is using it in guide mode it is much harder to pull rope through it than an ATC Guide especially with thick diameter ropes",1
5658,"""   Yup~ that's typically the same for me",1
5659,Unless I'm planning on getting in a lot of lead pitches~ I don't have a thin rope,1
5660,When I have a thin rope I want the lightest device I can find so I haven't gotten the correct combo of rope+biner down that would optimize the Megajul,1
5661,Plus the rapping has been heinous,1
5662,:-)   Take care,1
5663,Well the guys at Climbing Technology were keen to have their product put through the wringer and in fact gave me a couple to play with~ they are like that as a company,1
5664,Early days on the testing as I only got home yesterday and had to remove my test rig this morning to use the overhead crane to turn a boat over,1
5665,Ignore the unlabelled curve above the MegaJul one,1
5666,7.8mm twin   Roughly follows the same general pattern~ the more assist at the start the less increase with hand force,1
5667,It´s a bit weak if only one strand is loaded but otherwise powerful enough,1
5668,In dynamic mode (usefully this is provided so we can direct see how effective the device is without the locking assist) it´s too weak with this diameter of rope and virtually every conventional plate would be better,1
5669,Just got to cut half the stuff off~ change the rest and it might go on the cliff with me!   And yes~ it´s a fairly steep learning curve with about a dozen modes I didn´t want.,1
5670,Shouldn't you have been testing the Micro Jul with that skinny rope instead of the Mega Jul? That is the extreme low end of rope diameter for the Mega Jul and the mid range for the Micro Jul,1
5671,The Micro Jul is clearly more suitable for that rope,1
5672,Edelrid specs:   Mega Jul -- Suitable for 7.8 - 10.5mm diameter ropes   Micro Jul -- Suitable for 6.9 - 8.5 mm double and twin ropes,1
5673,Out of curiosity~ how are you generating those smooth curves? Why not show the raw data instead of obscuring it with smoothed lines?,1
5674,Jim~ if a mega jul is set up correctly with an appropriate biner and rope diameter~ your graphs just don't make sense,1
5675,You cannot convince me that when a mega jul is fully locked~ it holds less load than an ATC,1
5676,To me~ that's ridiculous.,1
5677,Once the rope starts slipping under tension~ how much slippage occurs depends not on the fall factor but on the height of the fall~ and of course on how much resisting force the rope is slipping against,1
5678,So giving a slippage number~ even theoretically~ requires more data,1
5679,I don't know what happens with the assisted locking devices if the rope is already slipping through it (this does appear to be inevitable for big impacts) and then the climber lets go,1
5680,Neither the MegaJul nor the Smart seem to provide much in the way of hands-off resistance; the only device that appears to do that is the Alpine Up,1
5681,Until further evidence comes in~ I'd guess the assisted lockers will drop a falling leader if they start to slip and the leader lets go,1
5682,So you still need belay gloves~ maybe even more so than with an ATC-XP,1
5683,There is this video of the Alpine Up catching a factor 0.8 fall with a 70 kg weight on double 8mm ropes unattended and without much rope weight on the brake side~ which would make one think it can withstand a higher almost-zero-grip impact load then the 463 lbf (2 kN) in Jim's graph~ so that makes one wonder whether there might be something different about dynamic performance as opposed to slow pulling,1
5684,But we don't know how many times they tried this and what the percentage of successes was,1
5685,Maybe it a stop like this is in reality very unlikely..,1
5686,youtube.com/watch?v=nFn4xzV…,1
5687,someone needs to go out and do drop tests with real belayers in the system for these assisted locking devices   and publish the results   DAV/CAI ..,1
5688,im looking at you   ;),1
5689,This thread is a shit-sandwich.,1
5690,I'm still not sure why you climb places where you are at significant risk of a FF2~ with an inexperienced belayer you don't trust to catch you,1
5691,almost all factor 2 falls will not be held   You realize this is 100% speculation with no proof?,1
5692,The AAC doesn't have anything like the funds for a testing program,1
5693,Unlike the big European organizations~ it is just a climbing club~ and for years a gentleman's climbing club at that,1
5694,I've suggested over and over again that they at least make a serious effort to translate and make available the work done by the far wealthier European alpine clubs~ to absolutely no avail.,1
5695,If you want a rap backup~ you might want to eye the Petzl Shunt,1
5696,A little pricey and heavier than a prusik to be sure~ but expressly designed to be a rap backup,1
5697,Can double as an ascender~ and also used by some people for TR soloing,1
5698,From their website   SHUNT   Back-up rope clamp   Used below the rappel device~ the SHUNT works as a rappel back-up and replaces self- jamming knots like the Prusik,1
5699,Works on single and double ropes.,1
5700,Thanks for the read guys and especially thanks to Rich and Jim for some real analysis that was educational,1
5701,I took home some important refreshers of things that should be useful to all safe climbers,1
5702,While not all F2 or similar severe falls can be anticipated you and your belayer should be totally prepared to deal with all consequences and not be trusting your belay device to save you,1
5703,Your belayer has to do it,1
5704,Muscle memory of the belayer takes over when a climber falls,1
5705,This is a reminder to all of us to practice and assiduously use proper belaying technique with all these devices,1
5706,Bad muscle memory or panic leads to bad outcomes,1
5707,No device can overcome a belayer with bad habits or incomplete understanding,1
5708,Assisted locking devices are useful for holding hanging climbers and for minimizing fatigue for belayers and may give some (false) confidence to leaders...but are no substitute for proper knowledge~ experience or technique and will not stop severe falls,1
5709,Only brake hands will,1
5710,Ergo: Belay gloves are good,1
5711,"Fools are able to defeat any ""foolproof"" device",1
5712,In 40+ years of being in and out of climbing I have survived being dropped at least 3 times~ once in the gym (not hurt)~ once by belayer (nasty hand injury for him but he saved my life) and one 100' fall to the end of the rope (only meagre scratches)..,1
5713,Don't think it won't happen to you IT WILL HAPPEN if you keep climbing (we are humans~ not robots) and we can only minimize the incidence through attention to all details~ despite it seeming to ruin the fun through pedantic caution,1
5714,It is often people getting casual/lazy/a little too comfortable that leads to trouble,1
5715,"The ""expert"" and ""beginner"" are equally at risk in this regard",1
5716,Don't kid yourself.,1
5717,Thanks for all the info~ everyone,1
5718,Jim~ thanks for sharing your testing results,1
5719,Forgive me if I have overlooked something while reading the thread but there seems to be something missing from the discussion here,1
5720,Kilogram is not a unit of force,1
5721,Are we all talking about Newtons? Not trying to be pedantic - I would really like to use the data for kinematic calculations that approximate real life situations,1
5722,I also second shoo's request for the raw data - I doubt it is all still lying around but in the future it would be extremely helpful,1
5723,I suspect climbing has more than its fair share of engineers and math nerds.,1
5724,I use kgf often as the numbers are easier to understand for things like belay devices~ if I say a belay hand force of 25kg then everyone can tie a 25kg weight onto a rope and see what it feels like to hold~ writing 0.25kN force on the belayer side rope would mean nothing to most people,1
5725,That it is force is defined in the caption,1
5726,The raw data is utterly uninteresting~ it either an endless stream of csv values which I tell my computer to do something with or me eyeballing a digital readout and making a judgement about when the value has settled down enough to be an accurate reflection of the forces I am seeing,1
5727,Rather than re-analysing my data the engineers out there would be better employed actually running some tests themselves to get independent results.,1
5728,Thanks for all the info~ everyone,1
5729,Jim~ thanks for sharing your testing results,1
5730,Forgive me if I have overlooked something while reading the thread but there seems to be something missing from the discussion here,1

5734,I suspect climbing has more than its fair share of engineers and math nerds,1
5735,Well~ in climbing~ lbf (pounds force) and kgf (kilograms force) are often used as an approximation of force,1
5736,You could convert it to Newtons easily if you like,1
5737,Since F=ma~ force in Newtown~ mass in kg~ acceleration in meters/s^2,1
5738,Simply multiply kg x 10 to get Newtons,1
5739,(9.81 if you want to be more precise),1
5740,I only read a couple pages of this thread but haven't seen this mentioned yet; as someone who owns a megajul and has used it several days in single and multi-pitch terrain~ I would not recommend buying one,1
5741,The device tends to twists the rope(s) more than a guide ATC,1
5742,As mentioned repeatedly~ it's not in the same class as a gri-gri so it's hard to really compare,1
5743,If you're looking for something comparable to a gri-gri maybe try an Alpine-up,1
5744,Thanks for clarifying that Jim and Greg,1
5745,I was unfamiliar with kgf and was unsure whether the gravitational constant was included in the force measurements or not,1
5746,I am very curious now to try the MegaJul with a 10mm rope,1
5747,With ~135 kgf provided hands free (assuming it engages)~  a 70 kg (155 lbs) climber at height d above his last piece of protection should come to a stop within about 2d below that piece if the protection holds and there is about 1 meter of slack,1
5748,For the areas I climb the only place I would really be concerned about this is below the third bolt as their might not be 2d before ground.,1
5749,Climbing friend~ for obvious assisted locking devices they are nary a substitition for proper knowledge~ experience~ and technique~ and it is agreed by all that fools are able to defeat any foolproof device~ yet still~ assisted locking devices are indeed less easy for a fool or unconscious person to defeat~ and therefore would be safer than the deadly ATC,1

5751,Don't get me wrong~ be-muscled climbing friend~ I wholeheartedly endorse the Way of the Gri for most of my climbing (such as it is these days),1
5752,But we must admit it is more complicated than that when people are injured by misuse of the Gri-Gri yet seemed to never to have been dropped by hip belays (though I have been~ fortunately for me not far),1
5753,"There is an element of inattention that we humans fall into~ complacency and neglect born of repetition etc...it is likely to be impossible to eradicate this unless we use a truly ""automatic"" belay robot",1
5754,Maybe it was the threat of rope burns on the belayer that lead to such careful attention and safer results with hip belays?,1
5755,Looking back to the device comparison: I have recently tried both Megajul and Sawela Ergo for lead belaying - for both I found unpredictable on paying out rope for clipping,1
5756,Sometimes easy and then a lock up that prevented rope going to the leader,1
5757,I realize these passive locking devices may have a learning curve~ but do not want to put my partner at risk during my curve,1
5758,The concept of a passive locking device makes sense~ but the application seems to still have some bugs to work out,1
5759,I wonder if the BD ATC Pilot~ if it ever gets released~ found the geometry for ease of paying out rope and reliable passive lock when needed.,1
5760,I found the thumb hook on the BD Pilot to be too small and wouldn't stay put reliably when feeding out slack~ I was not the only one with that experience,1

5766,Are you lifting up the thumb loop the whole time while paying out on the megaJul? If not you are going to lock it up~ if you watched their video it clearly shows this way of lead belaying.,1
5767,Are you lifting up the thumb loop the whole time while paying out on the megaJul? If not you are going to lock it up~ if you watched their video it clearly shows this way of lead belaying,1
5768,I used it just once in the gym and have watched a few videos now,1
5769,I may give it a try again~ but it struck me as a balance of force between pulling up on the thumb loop and the rope pulling it to lock down,1
5770,Just tried out the Mega Jul 2 - I found it easier to use than its forerunner,1
5771,Only drawback is weight and need for rappel device~ I always carry an F8 anyways,1
5772,This is my new go-to.,1

5775,This is my new go-to,1
5776,Are you referring to the Jul2 (https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5049-440/Jul2-Belay-Device) Or is there an update to the MegaJul? (https://www.rei.com/media/product/867679),1
5777,Didn't bother reading entire above thread just gonna add my experience: I own a mega jul and I love it,1
5778,It does exactly what I expect in that it is an assisting lock device,1
5779,It has never failed to lock up/ catch a fall~ but of course just like a grigri I always keep my brake hand on,1
5780,I love how light it is for alpine~ and that I can repell on multipitch ect,1
5781,Although it sucks to repell in locking mode~ just turn it around and use a prusik,1
5782,I also like that it can be used in guide mode,1
5783,(I understand people belay with a grigri directly of an ancho but that's not technically recommended~ whatever),1
5784,It can be a little jerky on rapell or when lowering a partner~ not too bad just not as smooth as an atc~ worth it imo,1
5785,One other thing is its now good for jugging a line~ I like to jug a line with 1 ascender and 1 grigri~ and the mega jul won't replace the grigri here,1
5786,Are you referring to the Jul2 (https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5049-440/Jul2-Belay-Device) Or is there an update to the MegaJul? (https://www.rei.com/media/product/867679) The first one,1
5787,If weight and only carrying one device is key~ then the second better choice,1
5788,"I find the larger thumb hook more comfortable on the first and less ""grabby."" ",1
5789,Tl;dr~ great assisted brake~ guide mode is garbage because of too much friction~ wait for the atc pilot,1
5790,I just finished reading all 13 pages of this thread,1
5791,Thanks to Jim~ Rich~ and everyone who's contributed,1
5792,I've learned a lot about the forces at play during a fall,1
5793,My takeaway is that the Megajul~ which I own and love~ may allow some slippage in a factor 2 fall~ leading to rope burns on the belayer's hands,1
5794,So in situations where such falls are possible~ it's a really good idea to belay with gloves on,1
5795,Did I get it right?,1

5801,Did I get it right?   Kinda,1

5809,So in situations where such falls are possible~ it's a really good idea to belay with gloves on,1
5810,Did I get it right?  Forget the fall factor stuff~ all you need is a fall producing a larger force than you can hold and with enough energy that the rope slip is more than your skin can cope with,1
5811,Anything more than about 1 to 1.5m slip is bad news and the variability in the hand force of climbers is enormous (and you will never know what you can hold until you test it),1
5812,Single-pitch you are unlikely to ever experience any problems unless you have a thin~ brand new rope and are a bit weak~ multi-pitch I´d never allow myself to be belayed with a Megajul.,1
5813,Having returned to climbing after a 20 yr hiatus~ it was amazing to see change in ropes,1
5814,Back in the day~ we climbed on single 11 or double nines,1
5815,With today's skinny singles and dry treatment~ seems like much less friction for stopping power.,1

5820,The treatments and consturction of modern ropes~ all in the interests of better handling and the equipment reviewers emphasis on the desirability of slick feeding of belay devices all go to make the actual braking power of most modern devices extremely questionable to put it nicely,1
5821,Once you start seeing people getting rope burns rapping you know things aren´t what they really should be.,1

5828,Jim~ did you mean you'd NEVER allow yourself to be belayed with a Megajul?,1
5829,Edited!,1
5830,Jim~ you wouldn't even allow yourself to be velayed on a multipitch route with a Megajul even if the belayer were using gloves? How about with the Alpine Up~ with or without gloves?,1
5831,Take a 9.2 to a 9.5  soft single rope - add a super duper dry treatment to it and they get pretty fast very quickly while new,1
5832,Even with a Gri Gri one needs to be careful lowering a heavy climber~ it can be done safely of course but does require greater care,1
5833,I believe it's the waterproffing that causes much of the problem - it's extremely slick,1
5834,My wife now likes to wear gloves - never wanted them before.,1
5835,Jim~ you wouldn't even allow yourself to be velayed on a multipitch route with a Megajul even if the belayer were using gloves? How about with the Alpine Up~ with or without gloves?  Was curious to ask more or less the same,1
5836,"I always belay with gloves~ and ask my belayers to use gloves (lending them mine in case)~ in any case (sport climbing single pitch~ bolted multipitch~ more trad-ish situations) so I wonder how much the ""rope slippage"" issue would matter in this case..",1
5837,Was curious to ask more or less the same,1
5838,"I always belay with gloves~ and ask my belayers to use gloves (lending them mine in case)~ in any case (sport climbing single pitch~ bolted multipitch~ more trad-ish situations) so I wonder how much the ""rope slippage"" issue would matter in this case.",1
5839,1 meter of slippage could be the difference between hitting a ledge right as the rope catches you and hitting a ledge at full speed.,1
5840,1 meter of slippage could be the difference between hitting a ledge right as the rope catches you and hitting a ledge at full speed,1
5841,Couldn't 1 meter of rope slippage also be the difference between an injury and a merely painful catch when the falling climber is halted? It was my understanding that Jim's cautions regarding the Megajul concern the belayer getting rope burns from rope slippage (and also possibly dropping the climber because of the rope burns),1
5842,Any belay device can allow rope slippage~ as Jim's charts show; the Megajul just does it at a lower level of force than the devices we've been discussing,1
5843,Jim~ please correct me if I've misunderstood!,1
5844,Jim~ you wouldn't even allow yourself to be velayed on a multipitch route with a Megajul even if the belayer were using gloves? How about with the Alpine Up~ with or without gloves?  Wearing gloves reduces the braking force even more so while the belayer doesn´t get rope burns the fall length is unescessarily increased~ I´d just give the person another device instead,1
5845,The Alpine Up is another ball game as it has exceptional braking power when it locks up,1
5846,Couldn't 1 meter of rope slippage also be the difference between an injury and a merely painful catch when the falling climber is halted? It was my understanding that Jim's cautions regarding the Megajul concern the belayer getting rope burns from rope slippage (and also possibly dropping the climber because of the rope burns),1
5847,Any belay device can allow rope slippage~ as Jim's charts show; the Megajul just does it at a lower level of force than the devices we've been discussing,1
5848,Jim~ please correct me if I've misunderstood!  With a few exceptions all devices allow a bit of slip~ the ideal situaltion is that the device is powerful enough that the belayer can reduce slip to a minimum OR allow however much they feel is required to protect marginal gear when ice climbing for example or to allow the faller to pass the lip of the roof they have just climbed,1
5849,The half-automatic devices generally give the worst of both worlds~ that is the braking power is often less than one would wish for but it´s effect is hard to modulate for the belayer,1
5850,With a conventional device of sufficient power one can allow considerably more slippage under control without danger of rope burns as the need to grip the rope hard is reduced.,1
5851,Do the advantages of dry treatment outweigh the additional slippage (and cost!),1
5852,Also~ does the benefit of lower weight and less stretch in skinny ropes outweigh the lower friction? i am hearing better braking with fatter untreated ropes.,1

As you have probably long since realized---I am no physics expert and can't even fathom a guess! Thanks Jim!   This diversion into mechanics of falls versus actual uses of safe belay devices is a fool's errand,1
5879,We do not have control over the route and rock as much as we would like to think and cannot engineer ideal situations on the spot when confronted with a FF2 event,1
5880,These are almost always going to be unexpected and the result of gear placement failure~ rock breakage~ rock fall etc,1
5881,All we can do is use safe tools that give us a chance of surviving them~ if you aren't using a safe tool tragedy may result,1
5882,Never waste time thinking about whether or not you should or shouldn't clip the anchor as if that is going to make the difference,1
5883,If you are worried about that then your anchor is bad and you shouldn't be putting yourself in any position to fall on it whatsoever.,1
5884,There's a lengthy discussion on Supertopo about whether or not clipping the anchor is a good idea~ see http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=731822&tn=180,1
5885,In terms of just the anchor load~ clipping the anchor will usually result in a considerably higher anchor load than a factor 2 fall~ with a break-even point occurring when the leader is still very close to the anchor in most cases (it of course depends on how far below the anchor the belayer is situated),1
5886,But belayer distance from the anchor isn't the only issue~ there is also the question of whether the belayer is anchored down or could collide with the anchor~  whether slippage through the belay device is possible~ and if it is~ whether the belayer can manage it,1
5887,The era I grew up in as a climber~ when it was relatively common in the US to practice catching high fall factor falls with weights~ is now a distant memory,1
5888,Most belayers have not experienced anything close to such falls and have no idea how they might perform or what adjustments in their technique might improve that performance,1
5889,Extensive experience on the kinds of moderate falls that are typical~ especially in sport climbing~ provides no insight into the extreme situations and may lead to unjustified confidence,1
5890,Moreover~ there is an assumption that belay technology is up to the task~ but this assumption is questionable at best and demonstrably false in some cases,1
5891,Deciding not to clip the anchor~ in spite of the advantages in terms of anchor load~ means relying on belay skills that might not exist,1
5892,Modern bolted anchors can take whatever the situation can dish out~ but there is a bit more to worry about for trad anchors~ which could conceivably be overwhelmed by very high loads,1
5893,In my 60 years of climbing~ I've heard or read of about such total anchor failures approximately every five years,1
5894,Except for one miraculous case~ all such failures have resulted in the death of the party,1
5895,Such extreme falls are so rare that we have essentially no empirical information on the reliability of trad anchors in general for such circumstances,1
5896,I 'm not persuaded by the argument that there is really no problem because if you are thinking about the issue at all~ you have a bad anchor and should do something about that,1
5897,Personally~ I've felt forced to belay from anchors I judged questionable on a number of occasions,1
5898,I absolutely did not clip them~ and discussed with the leader that I would be belaying dynamically in the original sense of the word~ which means deliberately allowing some slippage through the belay device,1
5899,But this is something I've actually practiced with weights and know how to do,1
5900,Obviously~ this is a leader must not fall situation~ but embracing the optimum belay strategy for it seems to me to make more sense than just accepting that the leader isn't going to blow it,1
5901,It seems fairly well known by now that the best strategy for such situations is to get the belayer far from the anchor and have the leader clip the anchor~ but this isn't always possible; it depends on the terrain below the belay stance.,1

As you have probably long since realized---I am no physics expert and can't even fathom a guess! Thanks Jim!  Like any device except the Grigri and it´s relatives the ClickUp doesn´t do anything faced with FF2 unless the belayer changes to brake hand up~ then it should work like anything else,1
5907,Hands-free (as in the paranoic but seldom encountered horror scenario of a disabled belayer) the ClickUp like all the rest does absolutely nothing~ that is the difference between the test for the European standard~ Cat 1 devices have to stop a hands-off FF2 and Cat 2 have no braking test at all,1
5908,I don´t test applications~ only the physical attributes of equipment.,1
5909," ""I 'm not persuaded by the argument that there is really no problem because if you are thinking about the issue at all~ you have a bad anchor and should do something about that."" +1  Whether or not to clip the anchor has nothing to do with the quality of the anchor",1
5910,It's a judgment call based upon the terrain and pitch at hand,1
5911,Further---I see this one all the time now...a party~ out of habit~ clips the anchor and off the leader goes....not realizing that the farther he gets away from the anchor~ the more forcefully the belayer will be pulled towards the clipped anchor--in some cases that could be upwards~ but I too often see people sitting away from the anchor or leaning back---not realizing in a high-force fall they will be pulled into the rock~ more than upwards---it's just asking to be smashed face first into the anchor/rock,1
5912,I won't even ask~ Jim or Rich~ about direct belaying....that would open an enormous can of worms! It's a cool technique~ though~ for certain circumstances....and on bolts~ perhaps the best option in the event of a factor2....(think: guiding Mental Physics in JTree with a 100-lb client)..,1
5913,Anyway~ thanks for the chat~ gents! RC,1
5914,I  think the quality of the anchor is an important consideration~ along with the terrain~ the proximity of the belayer to the anchor~ and the nature of the pitch to come~ in deciding whether or not to clip it,1
5915,Well~ you didn't ask~ but I think a direct belay with a Munter hitch  on a pair of modern bolts seems to me to be about as good a belay as it is possible to have for single-rope climbing,1
5916,But with a gear anchor~ it seems to me that you'd want four pieces---two for upward loads and two for downward loads---and that isn't very practical much of the time.,1
5917," Yeah~ the way you put it is a more accurate statement----sure~ with a sub-optimal anchor~ you'd think twice about clipping it....but my initial discussion wasn't about the quality of the anchor (which should always be built ""up to task"")~ rather----the idea that clipping it creates problems as well as solves one.....this was my motivation for chiming it....that often one problem gets overprioritized (the holding power of a particular belay device)~ when the problem could be solved another way or another problem might be a consideration~ too--- Anyway....the direct belay thing~ I bet~ will be the source of some innovation/creativity in the years to come...we'll see",1
5918,Have a super weekend and hope you get out to climb! RC,1
5919,What I was trying to say~ Rich~ and hope you can appreciate~ is that it goes beyond human ability to know precisely when the anchor can hold in some sort of dynamic and heroically perfect belay (and the anchor holds by the smallest of margins) as a means of survival for the party versus the far greater likelihood of simply dropping the leader (ie the deadly atc et al) in a FF2 event onto a solid anchor due to bad technique or poor choice of device,1
5920,Recognizing that the anchor is less optimal and that the leader must not fall is **the only guarantee** available~ imo,1
5921,I guess I come from this point from this side~ primarily~ and emphasize this as a fundamental to safe climbing~ particularly as 99.99% of climbers have zero experience doing an ideal dynamic belay in a FF2 scenario,1
5922,I just don't think its going to save hardly anyone (ie perhaps some tiny fraction of climbers) in the real world versus being aware and simply not falling,1
5923,Being totally aware of the situation is very different than trusting the anchor blindly and then proceeding to push one's limits right above the belay etc,1
5924,If your anchor is less than ideal~ make it ideal or don't fall is the only advice I give,1
5925,And bail if you think a fall is likely,1
5926,Anything more I think is beyond the scope of internet prognostication ie the party in this situation better be advanced and cognizant of the situation and have learned this sort of esoteria from their mentors in the real world rather than simply reading about it,1
5927,I tailor my comments to beginners in a sense in this regard~ sparing them the rare situation and focusing them on the common,1
5928,However~ having the belayer as far below as possible is a very sound idea~ though I will share as an ideal solution in an emergency,1
5929,"That's the most likely to be effective form of ""dynamic belay"" that can reliably be done~ imo.",1
5930,In climbing we usually talk fall protection rather than fall prevention~ but the fact is that fall prevention is going hurt a lot less and less frequently than fall protection,1
5931,Obviously shit happens~ but really your best protection from injury is holding on with your two hands and feet,1
5932,On a side note~ you might be amazed by what strength you can harness when you really don't want to fall,1
5933,I only read a couple pages of this thread but haven't seen this mentioned yet; as someone who owns a megajul and has used it several days in single and multi-pitch terrain~ I would not recommend buying one,1
5934,The device tends to twists the rope(s) more than a guide ATC,1
5935,As mentioned repeatedly~ it's not in the same class as a gri-gri so it's hard to really compare,1
5936,If you're looking for something comparable to a gri-gri maybe try an Alpine-up Agreed that it twists the ropes,1
5937,That said~ it's so light~ so good at assisted braking~ and so easy to feed slack~ I continue to use it anyway (but only for big alpine routes where I like being able to take my hands off for a second~ and where weight is paramount),1
5938,I have now had more time to play with MegaJul Sport and by far my new favorite! It does take some time to dial in how to use~ but once you get the hang of it~ feeds out easily for belaying a leader and can be used like ATC for top roping/gym use,1
5939,Lowering is the trickiest to get down - helpful to have a glove on.,1
5940,I have a MegaJul and a MegaJul Sport,1
5941,They both work well but the sport is definitely smoother for feeding~ lowering and rappelling.,1
5942,extreme precautions when rapelling or tope rope securing/descending..,1
5943,It has happened to me in a real climb.Abseiling down  with a new rope (10 M,1
5944,M,1
5945,Beal  Tiger),1
5946,With MegaJul Normally  we must act to abseil down~ like a Gri-Gri.Abseiling down I stopped on a ledge to untangle the rope,1
5947,For a moment no tension was at the device and the rope crossed at the Megajul hole...and I didn´t realize that..,1
5948,as I put in pictures attached here ~result: if the rope is crossed no longer blocks the device!!! it is easier to happen with thin ropes even meeting the specifications of ropes accepted by the device from 7.8 to 10.5 M,1
5949,M,1
5950,and can happen at top rope securing/descending too I think  this fact should be noticed in the user´s manual,1
5951,B,1
5952,Regards,1
5953,I believe it is noted in the manual for top belay but I'm not sure if they warn about this happening on rap,1
5954,The more you get into the technicalities of the MegaJul and similar devices the more warning flags pop up,1
5955,These devices can be great but their limitations are basically unknown by the general public,1
5956,That is a problem,1
5957,Jim Titt has highlighted many already~ lots of them occur are small probability events~ but it is precisely these small probability event that you want a device that behaves reliably and predictably,1
5958,Anyway there was a near miss recently down in Tasmania that involved severe rope burns and a MegaJul...,1
5959,(The epic had a serious of cascading errors but the climbers kept themselves safe and the PBL trigger was an accident while it was in somebodies pocket.) Jim Titt's comment above should be remembered well for anybody wanting to use the MegaJul or a similar assisted locking device with thinner ropes,1
5960,Sure the Megajul is only rated for 7.9mm but it isn't unreasonable that people might unknowingly use small diameter ropes.,1
5961,Megajul saved my partner,1
5962,He clipped a piton that was the highest pierce in a three piece anchor~ fell about 10 feet onto the anchor~ ripping the top piton and hurling me downward,1

5977,It also resoles really well because of the no edge,1
5978,Hope that helps!,1

5980,You might be able to find a pair of Speedsters~ but stateside~ the Futura or Maverink is as close as you'll get,1
5981,Sather is right~ the Maverinks are super soft and will stretch significantly,1
5982,Built for lighter climbers,1

5984,Awesome shoes~ made your feet strong!,1

6033,A meteor won't end it all because it's just burnt dust,1
6034,For correctness it should say Giant Meteorite 2020 Indicating it was able to survive the fiery fall through the atmosphere and impact the earth's surface.,1
6035,They're selling to people would purchase an $8K watch as casually as you'd purchase  a latte,1
6036,If you're making well over 7 figures~ $8K is basically pocket change,1
6037,They're not suckers - they just operate in a vastly different economic space,1
6038,Yes.,1
6039,So they are basically the same thing,1
6040,An asteroid is a hunk of rock and metal orbiting in space around the sun,1
6041,When it enters the earth's atmosphere we consider it a meteoroid,1
6042,If it burns up in the atmosphere it's called a meteor,1
6043,If it survives the fall through our atmosphere and doesn't completely burn up its then considered a meteorite,1
6044,So~ the bumper sticker is wrong?,1
6045,I actually just picked up one of these watches used,1
6046,It’s not bad!,1
6047,Don’t forget about Tunguska,1
6048,It doesn’t have to hit the ground to cause enormous devastation,1
6049,I chose wrong and picked up Chin’s used enema,1
6050,FML!,1
6051,Glad you bought used~ Panerai bottom drops out when bought new,1
6052,That said~ replica panerai are some of the best fakes on the market,1
6053,I would encourage you to take it to an expert~ have it authenticated,1
6054,Even send it in to panerai for a service,1
6055,Just for peace of mind,1
6056,Actually~ this may well not be true (the part about Rolex being worn on the first ascent),1
6057,Acopa shoes are making a come back and are beginning to process orders jan 1st,1
6058,They have re made some of the classics~ JB~ legends etc and look to be excellent,1
6059,i was sent a code for 15% off to share from jan 1st-march 31st so if youre looking to get some new kicks punch in  ZR43REF at checkout to save some cash,1
6060,The JB in particular look sick and very similar to the grandstone but with a narrower toe profile which looks sick for thin cracks,1
6061,How much money do you get when we use the code?,1
6062,Probably between 0%-15% of the price of the shoe.,1
6063,I get a pack of gummy bears,1
6064,Sams club size,1
6065,Hi~ I'm Troy McClure,1
6066,"You may remember from such shoe reviews as ""holy schnikes~ the Butora Mantra fits me""~ ""the Mythos stretched really nicely to conform to my flippers""~ and ""aw fuck~ I can't even stand up while wearing these""",1
6067,Today I'm here to share that Tenaya is expanding into the business of flipper fitting,1
6068,Unlike all previous Tenaya shoe models~ I was able to get a usable pair of Mastias on my feet without three metric shittons of empty space left over in the toebox,1
6069,For an 11.5 4E foot~ the rep started me at street size~ and then we dropped it down a half-size in Murican,1
6070,By the time he was wrapping up his shift~ I was considering dropping it another half-size~ so along with the Butora Endeavour*~ this makes two new-to-me models I've found this year,1
6071,The rep noted that they use a rubber formulation that is on the softer side~ so these are recommended as more as a svelte sendsation rather than a workhorse,1
6072,I found them slightly less sticky than the Endeavour~ but overall I endorse and will consider adding to the quiver after I'm done with the wallet shenanigans I've already planned,1
6073,* I tried them on a lark at the Spot Denver's grand opening and bought them like~ within 10 minutes,1
6074,They were intended to serve as my new gym beaters since the Cypher Prefix is no more~ but within two weeks~ they had replaced both indoor and outdoor shoes as the go-to...,1
6075,I think the Mastia has a pretty incredible ability to adapt to foot shape~ being so soft! I'm also 11.5~ but average to slight narrow and pretty low volume feet,1
6076,I don't own the Mastias~ but was able to get a really great fit out of them~ despite the single point of adjustment,1
6077,I did size WAY down~ though,1
6078,I think in general~ softer shoes are more forgiving of different foot shapes,1
6079,The Tenaya website even has a number scale for how much a particular model accommodates different shapes.,1
6080,Excellent Review! Your boy here with the duck feet and mega bunions has resorted to wearing Mantras but can't really get over the 2x4 feel on anything other than handcracks,1
6081,I'll give these Mastias a try! Good to know we're not alone in this world.,1
6082,Outside of the Masai and Tarifa~ which fit pretty narrow feet~ I’ve been happy with how the rest of the lineup fits my wide feet,1
6083,I wear the Iatis but the Oasi and Mundaka fit equally as well,1
6084,The two strap system works well to conform the shoe to my foot shape,1
6085,Mastia?! Sounds like some sort of breast infection.,1
6086,I got a pair when I was on holiday in France,1
6087,They feel like a clone of the Skwama~ but more form fitting and more comfy,1
6088,They climb really nice and feel a bit stiffer than the Iati at first but thanks to the midsole climb softer,1
6089,The rear of the shoe softened up quite a bit and torques during hard heel hooks much like Five Ten Teams did,1
6090,It feels like a wider~ comfier Team but slightly stiffer,1
6091,A ton like the UP Regulus LV,1
6092,The liner in mine ripped and the soles were delaminating so I contacted Trango and the US rep,1
6093,Despite only having my receipt~ which didn't show the item names~ they are sending me a new pair overnight,1
6094,Great customer service!,1
6095,Thanks for the heads up! Will have to try these,1
6096,8.5 EEEE here,1
6097,Had the best of luck with green Butora size 44 (oddly) so far.,1
6098,admin please delete,1
6099,Wrong forum,1
6100,What is the best very light biner for trad~ i.e,1
6101,a UL biner that DOES NOT CATCH OR SNAG on runners or anything else? (EDIT: somewhere toward the end of P,1
6102,"2 I added a ""Summarizing the summary of the summary"" which people may find useful.) Look up the reviews and the Camp Photon Wire~ 30g~ is supposed to handle by far the best of any of the UL biners~ even with gloves on",1
6103,There is a thread on that here~ but it's like 5 years old,1
6104,So~ let me ask for a different take and more modern (post-discontinuation of the BD oz) discussion: On the Photon Wire discussion~ not one person commented on THE issue for me - does the nose snag on runners? I'm a trad climber~ and all too often I have been in a sketchy stance trying to get a placement~ when I clip the sling...oops but the nose catches,1
6105,Well~ I'll just try aga..,1
6106,another snag,1
6107,OK~ I'll just pull this out and..,1
6108,arghghghg the biner pulled the sling out of position and my feet are about to blow out and arghghghghggh..,1
6109,you get the picture,1
6110,"At one point I started to buy the lovely petzl ""keyway"" design biners~ but those are HEAVY - currently on the petzl site at 39 g",1
6111,The Petzl Ange L is a full-size biner that is 34 g - not bad - but came in waaaay behind in the reviews in outdoorgearlabs.com review,1
6112,Both it and the Wild country Helium 2 are nearly 2X the price of the Camp Photon Wire as well,1
6113,I have a pair of old~ at the time very very fancy~ ultra-light dmm biners that are the king of heinous snagging,1
6114,Pictures of the photon wire nose~ which looks like a fish hook~ also looks exactly like the old DMMs~ and that terrifies me,1
6115,In the Photon wire discussion several people pointed out that they had poor quality control~ holes looked in the wrong places~ some gates were so soft they were returned or refused~ and someone said they were made in china - off my list for human rights reasons,1
6116,"So are you a trad climber and if so~ how would you rate the ""snagosity"" of the Camp Photon Wire?  It would be a service to the community here to compare ""snagaceousness"" to the best-known biners",1
6117," E.g.: ""yes I'm a strictly  trad climber~ and it snags never/rarely/noticeable amount/frequently out of hundreds of uses""",1
6118,Elseways~ what is your trad favorite lightweight biner and why? Thanks~ -TPC,1
6119,I never have trouble with my Photons,1
6120,I also like the Mammut Wall Light carabiners,1
6121,They're about the same weight and size as the CAMP Nanos but handle better~ IMO,1
6122,This was discussed in a recent thread but I couldn't find it,1
6123,EDIT linked Photons have the problems you mentioned and I've looked down to see them nose snagged before,1
6124,+ i've had to retire a bunch from the springs wearing out on the gate,1
6125,Dyons all the way,1
6126,Light~ don't snag~ and can be found for reasonably cheap if you look around and use a deal.Alpine draw biner discussion thread,1
6127,Wild Country Helium: https://www.wildcountry.com/en-us/helium-40-hel2  Light and snag free,1
6128,Been using them on my cams and alpine draws for years and really like them,1
6129,Sounds like you’re looking for the Wildcountry Helium Biner~ or maybe the DMM Alpha Trad Biner,1
6130,Both are great but the Helium gets my pick of Cost/handling,1
6131,DMM Chimera: https://dmmclimbing.com/Products/Carabiners/Chimera 30g,1
6132,+1 for Dyons,1
6133,They are the best snag free biner I have tried~ and the nose is tiny unlike DMM Alpha~ Petzl Ange~ or WC Helium.,1
6134,Big fan of dmm alpha trad  not cheap  Not super light Pretty colors  Lots of fun,1
6135,This has been discussed extensively and it always seems that most people prefer either the Wild Country Helium or CAMP Dyon,1
6136,I use dyon's for alpine draws and love them~ but the helium is great too~ I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed with either,1
6137,Although the dyon is basically just a snag-free photon~ the gate feel is completely different and I much prefer it to the photon,1
6138,It also seems to me that the quality is overall higher on the dyon's than the few photon's I have,1
6139,Regarding CAMP quality control~ I've been using dyons since they came out and have had no issues with any of them~ they all still feel great,1
6140,For whatever reason my photon's seem to be aging less gracefully~ despite having either similar or less mileage on them than my dyons.,1
6141,Snag free biners are going to be more expensive~ no way around it,1
6142,Photons will not do the trick,1
6143,Go for the dyons.,1
6144,Dyon is made in china,1
6145,Almost all of camps line is,1
6146,So you want people to jump through hoops for you~ proving their worth to you~ because you can't manage to get a carabiner through a sling? And you can't even get the facts straight on the advice already given to you?,1
6147,Yea it's a good thing the US never did anything bad to anyone,1
6148,Especially not Indians and slaves.,1
6149,Pirate~ agree with you on the china aspect and I should really put my money where my mouth is..,1
6150,but I've yet to find a better biner than the Dyon and~ at $7.50 each~ that adds up when we're talking a few dozen of them,1
6151,Very easy to score them on sale for anywhere from 7-8 bucks~ and I don't even like heliums as much~ let alone for 10 bucks (don't seem to find them at as good of sale prices as dyons),1
6152,Perhaps it is a small benefit~ but the wiregates that are snag-free and enclose the gate in a hood have the added benefit of reducing the chance of the gate opening when scraped against the rock,1
6153,It seems to me that the Dyon is actually more likely to have this happen than many other biners,1
6154,With the Alpha Light and OZ apparently being discontinued~ that leaves the Chimera and Helium as two excellent choices (but unfortunately pricey),1
6155,I like the lighter Chimera for racking cams~ and the larger Helium for general purpose use,1
6156,I've also used the Ange S~ which has the smoothest clipping nose~ but do not particularly like pinching the single wire when holding the spine.,1
6157,Smaller options are the WC Helium and DMM Chimera~ both have a nose that protects the wire gate,1
6158,Larger option with great clip ability with gloves is the DMM Alpha Trad.,1
6159,Yea it's a good thing the US never did anything bad to anyone,1
6160,Especially not Indians and slaves,1
6161,That's why I don't buy American climbing gear that was manufactured in the 19th century.,1
6162,That's why I don't buy American climbing gear that was manufactured in the 19th century,1
6163,Hahaha you really think the US just stopped doin evil shit and became the good guys? Not to mention we wouldnt be where we currently are without those acts of the past? Do you know how many violent coups we have initiated this century? Do you have any idea how many civilians have been killed by drone strikes? Every nation on this planet has committed terrible atrocities~ bar none~ so using human rights violations as a reason not to purchase gear from a particular country~ especially by implying that by buying US gear keeps you safe from that fact~ is asinine.,1
6164,So~ there goes the Nose,1
6165,Or anything on El Cap~ really,1
6166,"But false ""trad"" purity is important~ I'm sure",1
6167,and? you're striking it off just based on that review?,1
6168,Summarizing the summary of the summary Thanks again people for all your varied contributions,1
6169,I have really learned a LOT - much more than from manufacturer's info,1
6170,Thanks to folks above for setting me straight on some points,1
6171,My summary is that the four biners below are excellent~ fairly lightweight~ each has their own place I suppose,1
6172,I did not find many reviews of the Chimera~ but people go nuts over them and do not complain they are hard to clip..,1
6173,but they have a substantially smaller gate opening~ possibly the widest nose here~ but they are 10% lighter~,1
6174,Biner                | weight | gate Wd | lowprice | Comments   (reference for made in) Helium II           33g        27mm      $10.88     Great reviews~ many fans~ big nose hard to clip some bolts~ chains~ not that light~ comments about being easy to handle in gloves; made in Taiwan (mec.ca) Camp Dyon      33 g       26 mm      $10.46    many fans~ not loved for quality~ not in best-known reviews~ made in china (sierra.com) DMM Chimera 30g        21 mm      $11.21    snag-free~ but nose is possibly even wider than HeII~ made in Whales (mfgr video etc.) Petzl Ange L    34 g       26 mm      $9.32       many people hate the single wire~ supposedly there is a right way to clip which fixes this; one review claimed nose ices up; made in france (mtntools.com) gate Wd = gate width lowprice = lowest price via google search Comments and Made in....people say all kindsa stuff about where something is manufactured~ so I tried to give a reference (in parenthesis),1
6175,"Could we say the ultimate combo would be to have HeII on the rope side~ Chimera on the cam?   Others Noted ---------------------- DMM Alpha Trad 35 g 25 mm opening looks like standard wire hook nose but has the same description as Chimera nose~ ""clean nose""",1
6176,opening standard wire hook nose,1
6177,It's a bit heavier than the rest,1
6178,Mammut wall light - 23 g~ has standard wire hook nose,1
6179,About Snagging -------------------------- Most carabiners these days have a really nice~ really smooth finish~ and rounded edges,1
6180,Snagging occurs primarily when the nose hook encounters the thin edge of your runner,1
6181,So~ with a hood~ the hook is still there to hook things~ but since you can't get the thin edge of the runner into the crook of the hook~ you could probably never snag it,1
6182,Modern biners save weight using wire to remove the gate and save weight~ voila~ all of the ones above are hooded wired~ except for Ange~ which is a single wire and different,1
6183," Other Comments: ------------------------------- I disqualified any tiny or mini-biners - if we're paying double to avoid a snag~ what would be the point of including a biner so small you complained it was hard to clip ropes?  DMM Marketing take note:  I had to work sooooo hard~ and have soooo many people jump on me before I found a picture that showed that the Chimera has a ""hooded"" design~ and is probably snag-free",1
6184,Good pictures are important~ folks! There is a review that shows all these biners together~ and the chimera looks like it has the largest nose..,1
6185,but it's unclear whether it's compared to a Helium I or II,1
6186,https://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2017/09/13/comparison-review-lightweight-snag-free-carabiners/ COMPARISON: Petzl spirit I think was one of the first non-snaging biners~ solid gate and keyway - 39g $8.54~ not so fancy but works great,1
6187,They are my favorite biner in my current collection before I got all these comments and will go shopping (among a collection of truly awesomely  old~ heavy (one is 65 g!!!!)~ random and sometimes nasty biners).,1
6188,You’re a boss,1
6189,Thanks for putting the time into this summary of a summary.,1
6190,The description is clear: https://dmmclimbing.com/Products/Carabiners/Chimera,1
6191,The picture is very obvious as well,1
6192,I have Helium on the rope side and Oz on the gear side,1
6193,I love it,1
6194,Then again I don't climb hard or often so my opinion should not carry much weight.,1
6195,2nd,1
6196,Been using these for many years.,1
6197,I got this deal on the Oz last fall~ and still not sure whether I regret it.,1
6198,Just to note: the Chimera IS a mini biner~ just not a micro biner,1
6199,They are quite nice~ but just a little too small for me,1
6200,I have been experimenting with many different biners to see which I like best,1
6201,I have settled on the CAMP Dyon for clipping pro~ the nose design is just SOOO thin~ you can fish the loop of a nut/cam out of a crack much easier than any other biner,1
6202,I do not like the mushy action on Helium~ or the wide nose on the Alpha~ though they seem to be very popular,1
6203,Gonna have to say my helium's for alpine draws/extras and nanos for racking,1
6204," As far as I can tell a relatively ""light"" and ""snag free"" biner don't really go together right now",1
6205,Calling a 30+g carabiner light in 2019 is miss categorizing it considering there are 19g biners on the market and a few in the low 20's,1
6206,A 19g is light~ a 30g biner is average and 40g is heavy (Standard Petzl Spirit),1
6207,That's the same reason I use Nanos,1
6208,Put differently~ 466 grams is the same weight as a full set of BD ULs from .4 to #2,1
6209,The micro/mini carabiner sub-category: Nano~ 19g~ Metolius Mini~ Ange S  etc~ are too hard for my old arthritic~ beat up sausage fingers to clip and/or manipulate,1
6210,That is why I personally went away from them,1
6211,I don't climb at an elite level for trad~ so I don't need to shave off that last little ounce,1
6212,Even if I did~ it would be easier to just lose a couple of pounds off my gut than have to deal with those tiny biners,1
6213,Seriously~ a good shit offsets all of your weight savings for micro biners,1
6214,But some people obviously like them,1
6215,Oh~ believe me,1
6216,I use EVERY advantage I can find,1
6217,as much as I want to save weight~ I'm currently upgrading (or is that downgrading?) the remaining OZ racking biners I have~ to DMM Chimera,1
6218,Currently have a mix of WC Helium~ DMM Alpha Trad~ OZ~ and a couple Astros - whenever I clip directly to a cam with an OZ or even just take it off my harness~ I hate the gate feel,1
6219,Annoying to clip too,1
6220,The WC/DMM biners just feel so much better to use,1
6221,I'm mainly justifying the weight increase (28 to 30g ea) by looking at the kn ratings - 20/7/7 UIAA minimum for BD~ vs 23/7/9 for Chimera~ and even higher for Helium/Alpha Trad Also the rope bearing radius is larger for the non-mini biners,1
6222,Less drag~ less wear,1
6223,When I'm leading trad at my limit~ the approach shoes and water go on the follower - makes way more difference than 7oz of 'biner savings,1
6224,I hate fumbling to clip when pumped,1
6225,As much as I want to go with 19/22g biners~ I know I'd end up hating myself after and end up selling them.,1
6226,For me..,1
6227,id rather have a sparse rack and easy to handle biners,1
6228,Biner weight is my new go-to excuse,1
6229,Since when is clipping and handling a biner such a hard task? Wtf are you people talking about?,1
6230,I honestly don't find 19g biners hard to handle at all,1
6231,I've spent a fair bit of time technical alpine climbing in gloves with them and manage to clip/unclip them just fine,1
6232,I kinda prefer a sparse and light rack not just a sparse one,1
6233,Best of both worlds,1
6234,I think small biners have gotten a bad rap from the metolius mini biners which were the first truly small biner to the market,1
6235,Those things are absolutely awful to use!  Gate opening was too small~ the lip of the basket was too high and the spine had zero reverse curve which produced a poor handling experience,1
6236,And they aren't even that light.,1
6237,I honestly don't find 19g biners hard to handle at all,1
6238,I've spent a fair bit of time technical alpine climbing in gloves with them and manage to clip/unclip them just fine,1
6239,I kinda prefer a sparse and light rack not just a sparse one,1
6240,Best of both worlds,1
6241,One of the only reasons I'm not a huge fan of the super light carabiners is that they tend to be small~ which I do find difficult to clip with gloves (bare hands no problem),1
6242,Notably~ either when climbing with double ropes or when I'm trying to clip by stabilizing the carabiner with my middle finger,1
6243,When my hands are already cold this can further complicate matters,1
6244,Do you just avoid this clipping method?,1
6245,First bolded section: How do you post to the internet? What are you using?,1

6251,Saw this posted here on MP a while back.,1
6252,^meh Only if it is cheaper or lighter than a Dyon,1
6253,It isn't~ when sized for my hands,1
6254,I don't know how old you are~ but a lifetime of using my hands has left them less than dexterous,1
6255,Sometimes they don't do what I want them to~ or do it with a lot of pain,1
6256,I quit playing guitar because barre-ing a chord was excruciating on my thumb,1

6268,That's totally funny,1
6269,We had a large dog run(12'x20') on a concrete slab in our back yard growing up,1
6270,When my parents sold the house the new owners converted it into a play area for their kids!,1
6271,Notably~ either when climbing with double ropes or when I'm trying to clip by stabilizing the carabiner with my middle finger,1
6272,When my hands are already cold this can further complicate matters,1
6273,Do you just avoid this clipping method? Yep~ I generally avoid using the finger clip method when I've got gloves on regardless of what carabiner I'm using,1
6274,If the biner is on a long sling and the gear isn't to far away~ say while ice climbing~ I'll pull up some rope~ bite it with my teeth and then grab the sling and clip that to the rope,1
6275,Really easy to just push the biner over the rope with this technique.,1
6276,F you weight weenies~ I’m headed towards steel like god intended.,1
6277,Yep~ I generally avoid using the finger clip method when I've got gloves on regardless of what carabiner I'm using,1
6278,If the biner is on a long sling and the gear isn't to far away~ say while ice climbing~ I'll pull up some rope~ bite it with my teeth and then grab the sling and clip that to the rope,1
6279,Really easy to just push the biner over the rope with this technique,1
6280,Cool~ thanks,1
6281,I definitely just smack the carabiner onto the rope ice climbing since gear is lower and there's rope weight,1
6282,This mostly comes up for me on trad mixed where I might be placing a cam high in an overlap or something before committing to the steep move and the carabiner is totally free hanging,1
6283,I'll just work on my comp clipping.,1
6284,How does this influence your purchase of carabiners? It doesn't influence MY purchase of climbing gear at all~ as evidenced by the amount of Made in USA gear I own.,1
6285,For what it’s worth~ Wales has been largely devoid of human rights abuses,1
6286,Cymru am byth,1
6287,It doesn't influence MY purchase of climbing gear at all~ as evidenced by the amount of Made in USA gear I own,1
6288,Actually Greg specifically mentioned slavery and Indian policy~ hence the 19th century reference,1
6289,And the OP's stance is not hypocrisy since I'm pretty sure he hasn't committed atrocities himself.,1
6290,Dave K wrote Children are being detained because adults have brought them into the country outside of established legal processes for family immigration I'm sure the children in cages here take great comfort knowing it was their parent's choice to come here~ versus having no choice in China,1
6291,Hey wait a minute do parents in Honduras and Venezuela really have a choice when their children are starving?,1
6292,I honestly don't find 19g biners hard to handle at all,1
6293,I've spent a fair bit of time technical alpine climbing in gloves with them and manage to clip/unclip them just fine,1
6294,I kinda prefer a sparse and light rack not just a sparse one,1
6295,Best of both worlds,1
6296,I think small biners have gotten a bad rap from the metolius mini biners which were the first truly small biner to the market,1
6297,Those things are absolutely awful to use!  Gate opening was too small~ the lip of the basket was too high and the spine had zero reverse curve which produced a poor handling experience,1
6298,And they aren't even that light,1
6299,Well spoken mikey..,1
6300,ill have to try out those 18gs.,1
6301,I like photons a lot~ most of my rack uses those,1
6302,I went to REI last weekend to try out biners~ and the only biner they had that is discussed here was the Petzl Ange (they might have had only the S; it was snag-free but I can see how some folks would need to get used to it for handling),1
6303,As for mini-biners to try~ REI only had the metolius,1
6304,Losers! What's really interesting - not ONE single biner there had its weight (mass) listed on the package -  not even the Heliums! WTF???Re: Mini-biners:  I was fascinated by Mikey Schaefer's comment quoted just below,1
6305,I have never used mini or micro biners,1
6306,"I do know that I get really frustrated with ""snaggy"" biners~ and there are no snag-free minis",1
6307,One poster above said min-biners should be banned (or something to that effect)~ and he's not the only one,1
6308,BUT then there is Mikey's post: I honestly don't find 19g biners hard to handle at all,1
6309,I've spent a fair bit of time technical alpine climbing in gloves with them and manage to clip/unclip them just fine,1
6310,I kinda prefer a sparse and light rack not just a sparse one,1

6314,And they aren't even that light.,1
6315,Dude:,1
6316,Buck~ I'm selling Alpha Lights for $8ea - the smaller~ lighter version of the Alpha Trad - now replaced by the Chimera,1
6317,About 2-3g lighter than the Trad/Helium~ slightly smaller - closer in size to an OZ I wish the Chimera/Alpha Light was a 28g biner - would make it a for sure option vs the Trad/Helium,1
6318,The weight savings can add up~ but the Trad/Heliums are nicer for rope clipping~ for me.,1
6319,I did an experiment a while back after re-tooling with Mini biners (19g~ Nano)~ and finding that I hated them and wanted a bigger biner,1
6320,So I bought 6 Trango Phase~ 6 Chimera~ 6 Phantom and 12 Ange S (good deal),1
6321,Paired with the Mammut Contact sling for an alpine draw.,1
6322,I honestly don't find 19g biners hard to handle at all,1

6328,And they aren't even that light,1
6329,I can't agree more about those blasted Metolius mini biners,1
6330,I have a friend who set his entire rack up with them,1
6331,Such a hateful carabiner,1
6332,Nothing against Metolius~ they make great stuff~ but those things are God-awful,1
6333,Great conversation I'm learning a lot,1
6334,I have @40-45 Heliums that don't get used any more,1
6335,I did what Mikey did and dropped down to those Edelrid 19g (and the 22ounce Camps too) biners for similar but differing reasons,1
6336,Coming back from a knee problem that's been screwing with me for a couple of years (Buck~ yer knees are next on the arthritis hate list buddy) I want light and have been climbing easier longer types of routes (trad),1
6337,They're not as nice as the Heliums~ not even close~ but hey~ 19g,1
6338,Next on the list is to drop the weight I put on~ but until then it's nice to take it off the rack,1
6339,I have a newer climbing partner now who wants to bring his rack~ as we have similar racks except for the biners~ I'm just now wondering if he hates on the 19g biners,1
6340,Anyway~ they suck and are fantastic simultaneously~  you might hate on them so try before you buy,1
6341,They're better than the little Metolius ones~ but still tiny and can be difficult to clip,1
6342,BTW~ Mikey~ as you climb a lot more than me you most likely already know this~ but Grivel makes a 37gram locker! They get that weight by being small and they suck in some circumstances as they're so tiny~ but for clipping off a pair of shoes or a water bottle to yer harness that you don't want unclipping on a long route...37GRAMS IS SWEET! Grivel Plume K3,1
6343,What I am doing now on some trad draws is have a compact biner for clipping gear~ and a larger~ yet still light-ish biner to clip the rope to,1
6344,Some people are OCD and need the same stuff~ but I am more franken-gear at this point.,1
6345,The Grivel plume is great for a locker,1
6346,On multipitch my only regular sized locker is the belay locker and the rest are plumes,1
6347,They work great and hold a clove just fine~ especially paired with a Mammut serenity,1
6348,What I am doing now on some trad draws is have a compact biner for clipping gear~ and a larger~ yet still light-ish biner to clip the rope to,1
6349,Some people are OCD and need the same stuff~ but I am more franken-gear at this point,1
6350,Most of my alpines are camp Nano on one end and Camp Photon on the rope end,1
6351,So you're not alone,1
6352,Camp Dyon hands down~ the Helium nose is too fat for some old school angles and pins.,1
6353,The BD wire nose thing also makes it too wide for some relic pins in BoCan and Eldo...,1
6354,Ange S,1
6355,Has anybody regularly used the beal birdie? What reviews do you give it? How does it compare to the grigri?  Thanks in advance,1
6356,I talked to a couple climbers~ they liked it more than GriGri,1
6357,mproj thread - ​https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/117695178/beal-birdie​​​,1
6358,I have been using the birdie and I really like it,1
6359,It’s smooth~ light and straightforward,1
6360,I have zero complaints!,1
6361,Do you think it feeds better than the Gri Gri when not holding the cam down? As in tube style feed?,1
6362,Do you think it feeds better than the Gri Gri when not holding the cam down? As in tube style feed? I've been using one for  few months and it does feed better than a GriGri when not holding the cam down~ but it's still not quite good enough to not hold the cam down when belaying a leader making quick clips.,1
6363,Generally I like it better and feeds better for me without holding can down,1
6364,I'm sure this depends upon what rope size/model it is paired with,1
6365,Lowering is super smooth,1
6366,I like that the handle is all metal,1
6367,Plastic handles give me the creeps.,1
6368,Yes~ I personally have been using the Birdie for a while now,1
6369,I own a gri-gri and a birdie~ both are real good for different reasons,1
6370,The main difference is weight~  the birdie is heavy~ its a hunk of metal,1
6371,However giving slack is amazing~ there is no awkward motion for giving slack,1
6372,Lowering can be weird but after a while you get use to it,1
6373,try the Mad Rock Lifeguard~ it's lighter than a grigri 2 (by a little bit)~ more compact~ economical~ and feeds well like a tube style  device when belaying,1
6374,No need to hold down the cam when feeding rope.,1
6375,I've found the birdie to be a little picky with certain ropes,1
6376,Some ropes stick in the device and require override of the cam when paying out slack,1
6377,Its also heavier than the grigri~ but I use my birdie in the gym where wight doesn't matter,1
6378,However~ its cheaper than the grigri,1
6379,The weight of the Birdy is just over an ounce heavier which to me is insignificant.,1
6380,i sold my grigri and got a birdie,1
6381,i've been using it in the gym the last few weeks with a bd 9.9 gym rope and mammut 9.8 infinity,1
6382,i wouldn't say it's good enough to really feed quickly without holding down the cam unless you want to move a lot on your feet to help with slack,1
6383,the problem is there isn't a lip to hold~ so i pinch the bottom by the carabiner hole and the cam which causes the rope to run right by my finger and burn it a little on occasion..,1
6384,i also think the lever provides less torque~ i feel like i have to crank pretty hard to get a decently fast lower,1
6385,and finally~ one point Beal made was the rope would run without a bend straight over the device but the geometry doesn't really force it to do this at all,1
6386,would i recommend it to a friend? yes,1
6387,is it a grigri killer? no,1
6388,is it worth saving the $30+(!!) for a grigri? probably yeah,1
6389,"the grigri isn't more ""premium""",1
6390,+1 to everything Chris said,1
6391,If you're picky it might not be for you,1
6392,But if you don't drop it~ you'll probably be handing it down to your grandkids because that thing isn't going to wear out anytime soon~ it seems.,1
6393,Alright so I had the birdie for a while and ended up returning it and here's why: -I knew that it would weigh more than a grigri~ but I didn't realize until I had one in each hand how much more it weighs,1
6394,If you trad and you're trying to keep your rack light~ I do not recommend -the second reason~ the reason why I returned it~ is that there isn't a safe way to quickly give out slack like with a grigri,1
6395,There's no thumb catch so if you need to hold the camming device down you have to do exactly what the Petzl (I know they didn't make it~ don't come for me) website says not to do which is hold the entire device in one hand and essentially let go of the brake rope,1
6396,This is so so so soooo dangerous,1
6397,I have climbing partners that like to clip lower and I need to give out a lot of slack at once,1
6398,I do not feel safe using this device for that reason exactly,1
6399,I think that it is worth mentioning that it does feed the rope smoother than the grigri~ but I don' think that this is reason enough to buy it,1
6400,I would not recommend,1
6401,If anyone asks~ I'd tell them to just buy a grigri.,1
6402,I'm fortunate to have the ability to test many types of climbing gear~ and I recently tried both the Mammut Smart 2.0 (as well as the original) with and without the Smarter attachment~ and the Black Diamond ATC Pilot.Mammut Smart 2.0,1
6403,The old smart shape was inferior to the new one~ and it didn't feed as smoothly as the 2.0~ bit I still agree it's nicer than the pilot,1
6404,Having tried out both~ I definitely feel that the pilot feeds more smoothly than the smart 2.0- but the rope does slip through when weighted for the pilot.,1
6405,Nice review~ it convinced me not to waste my money on the Pilot,1
6406,I use the auto bloc/lock devices to climb trees~ and prefer the type doesn't slip,1
6407,The Lifeguard works with the least amount of down rope of ones I have,1
6408,I recently got the Smart 2.0 package and the carabiner that comes with it has the largest diameter of any carabiners that I have~ even industrial type steel ones,1
6409,One of the close ones is the original Petzl Attaché.,1
6410,If you're not getting smooth lowering with the Pilot~ I suspect you're doing it wrong,1
6411,Don't lift up on the thumb hook,1
6412,Push forward on the back of the device to rotate it.,1
6413,I am holding out until there is a Smart Alpine 2.0,1
6414,So am I,1
6415,2020 is what the rep claimed,1
6416,Another thing I noticed using the Pilot is that it gets HOT really quickly when lowering,1
6417,For what it's worth~ I got to climb in the Gunks with some AMGA Rock Instructors and Rock Guides~ and they now prefer the ATC Pilot as the belay device of choice to give to clients that they've just taught to belay~ especially when they're going to be lead belaying said guides.,1
6418,It's very likely their choice is based on BD aggressively promoting and discounting the Pilot for use by AMGA guides.,1
6419,The Smart 2.0 and Pilot are almost the same~ IMO~ in function,1
6420,I can also see why guides would want one of them in use by an unknown and inexperienced belayer,1
6421,I certainly agree with that,1
6422,I had a hold break shortly after I left the ground and placed my first piece~ fell and hit the end of the rope,1
6423,I looked down and my belayers hand was not on the rope,1
6424,Thankfully she had a smart~ because i would have broken a leg given the terrain and height,1
6425,It's very likely their choice is based on BD aggressively promoting and discounting the Pilot for use by AMGA guides,1
6426,I'll ask if they wouldn't mind me sharing their name~ but for what it's worth~ they got to try out each of the current devices on the market~ and the pilot was the one they chose.,1
6427,Ive only used the original smart and pilot but i wanted to point out that the lowering method is completely different~ so if you are used to using a pilot~ the smart will feel weird and vice versa,1
6428,On a smart~ you lower by pushing out(or up) on the nose,1
6429,On the pilot~ there's not much of a nose becaues you're supposed to grab both sides of the device and tilt it,1
6430,If you do it this way~ the lowering is super smooth,1
6431,Having used the original smart and the pilot the pilot is wayyyy smoother and more controlled for lowering~ and feeds smoother as well,1
6432,but I havent tried the smart 2.0,1
6433,yet,1
6434,The Smart is much more like a Megajul in how you use it~ as Danger noted,1
6435,I find the Pilot to feed better and to be much more ergonomically friendly specifically because you are gripping and rotating the device vs pushing outward on a nose/wire loop,1
6436,But in the end~ the important part is that you know how to use the device you choose well (I forget if it's Jim Titt~ rgold~ or healyje that has made really good points about knowing your device's failure modes~ and that all devices have one or more failure modes).,1
6437,I'm thinking about upgrading to the smart 2.0 from the original and found this thread,1
6438,One benefit I see for the smart over the pilot is that you can lower (or rap a single line) with both hands on the brake side of the rope,1
6439,Well there ya go...,1
6440,My use of the devices in question yields results that are the exact opposite of the OP,1
6441,BD better in all uses,1
6442,I chock it up to subjective assessment~ technique~ and the rope size/model.,1
6443,The Smart 2.0 is my favorite lead belay device,1
6444,Feeds slack smooth as silk and locks down quick and firm when you need it,1
6445,I wish you could double rope rap with it,1
6446,Wondering if you could safely rap with two of them side to side on the appropriate caribiner,1
6447,No matter~ the smart is light enough to carry along with a guide atc for belaying the follower off the anchor and rapping,1
6448,You need the Smart Alpine~ which apparently has a new version (2.0) coming out.,1
6449,Two of Mammut’s 6mm Rap lines can fit into the Smart 2.0~ probably the original also.,1
6450,You need the Smart Alpine~ which apparently has a new version (2.0) coming out,1
6451,You know they still make the original Smart Alpine~ right~ no need to wait,1
6452,I have used the Smart for single ropes and the Alpine when doing multipitch or rappelling for a while now,1
6453,It may be because I am used to it~ but I like the original better than the newer version,1
6454,I find the hook release better than the tab on the 2.0,1
6455,I like the Pilot~ it works just fine~ but the body does get hot when lowering.,1
6456,Hi everyone~ I would like to bring to your attention an issue with faulty cables on Moses Tomahawk Pitons that just caused a 40-foot leader fall on our ascent of the Muir Wall on El Cap (07/01 – 07/08),1
6457,Meanwhile~ a note has been posted on the Moses website (https://mosesclimbing.us/product-safety-advisory/) stating that all Tomahawks from 2019 through June may be affected – unfortunately too late for us!! In a nutshell~ I was leading pitch 29 (C4 crux) and placed 2 large Tomahawks in a row,1
6458,While bounce-testing the upper one~ I fell approximately 40 feet onto the portaledge we had set up at the anchor below,1
6459,While dangling off the deformed portaledge and gathering myself~ I realized that 2 micro nuts and an offset cam I had placed below the pitons had blown and were clipped to the climbing rope~ however~ the 2 Tomahawks I had placed last~ and which should still have been attached to my aiders~ were missing!  While leading the pitch the second time~ I saw that both pitons were actually still in the crack~ and the cable had pulled through the swage ferrule on both pieces (see photos)! I don’t understand why such a flaw in the manufacturing process has gone unnoticed for 6 months and I really think the climbing community has to be made aware of this issue beyond the brief note on the company’s website,1
6460,I'm not sure if Moses started a large-scale recall~ but thus far I haven't gotten any email from the retailer I purchased the pitons from! Therefore~ PLEASE SHARE this information~ so that further accidents can be prevented! These cables can pull under body weight!!!,1
6461,Wow! Thanks for sharing,1
6462,Glad you are ok,1
6463,What was the response like when you contacted the company?,1
6464," Interesting- Moses is saying that a  ""faulty swaging tool"" is at fault-- wonder how that happens? I've only ever swaged things by hand~ so I'm trying to understand how bad swaging can happen",1
6465,Glad you are okay!,1
6466,Thanks~ I was very lucky that it was not a natural ledge that I hit! I just messaged Moses today~ but I'll post their response as soon as I get it!,1
6467,This just shatters my life long theory that there are many ways to die climbing~ equipment failure is not one of them,1
6468,Man~ respect for getting back up there and finishing the pitch!,1
6469,We had to find out what happened! ..,1
6470,and get to the top ;),1
6471,Here is the message I wrote earlier today~ and Moses' response below: >> Dear Moses~ Your safety advisory note was unfortunately too late,1
6472,On June 07 I was leading pitch 29 of the Muir Wall ..,1
6473,(*the whole story*)  I was wondering~ if you already started a recall for those pitons,1
6474,I haven't yet heard anything from the store I ordered them from,1
6475,I would also appreciate if you would get in touch with me so (...) we can talk about how to deal with the situation,1
6476,<<Response: >> Yuki~ Sorry for the accident,1
6477,I will replace the cables on the Tomahawks and return them to you,1
6478,The address is on the webpage for shipping,1
6479,Thanks <<,1
6480,Hey sorry for your fall Yuki,1
6481,Glad you're ok!...and huge congrats for getting back up there~ for sure,1
6482,Muir is an amazing route! So so so good! Theron Moses is a stellar man~ and I'm sure any brevity in his responses here or to you personally is only because of limited free time (he is a family man who makes our climbing gear after hours at his machine shop job),1
6483,I'm really hoping to ramp up my rental offerings for bigwall stuff (maybe offer some low cost subscription where you could borrow all the gear~ bags~ ledges for $100/year?)~ so taking care of~ and dialing out~ these speciality pieces will be easier,1
6484,For the last several years I've recommended just cutting off the cable that comes with the beak and putting on a high strength 5.5 cord,1
6485,See pic:,1
6486,Get the popcorn ready folks!,1
6487,The tooling wears out,1
6488,I’ve seen 2 hearty swedging tools develop hairline cracks after many many swedges,1
6489,That’s why there is a gauge that you use to periodically check your swedges.,1

6493,All sorts of stuff can happen to those tools,1
6494,Cracks~ worn ovals in the head~ and even the pivot bolts and cast parts can egg out and give less than optimal swages,1
6495,And to be even scarier~ the gauge they give with the tool will not ensure a full strength swage across all the sizes,1
6496,It may look fine in the go/nogo gauge and still pull out at less than the cable BS.,1

6498,I’ve seen 2 hearty swedging tools develop hairline cracks after many many swedges,1
6499,That’s why there is a gauge that you use to periodically check your swedges,1
6500,Speaking as someone who professionally flies / suspendeds actors and performers as a real job~ the go/no go is used for every crimp not periodcally,1
6501,And forget about using the cheap tools and crimps~  I have an out of spec cheap tool that I use in my learning workshops that we crimp with and pull test~ scary the results of what looked like a good crimp.,1
6502," Exploiting someone's accident to promote your nascent rental business? I'd call that ""classic Sloan~"" except that those two words don't really belong together.",1
6503,Sounds like he is going to take care of it~ not much he can do beyond that?  Glad the problem got taken care of.,1
6504,Random question -- do you have business insurance for your rental company? I wonder if you would have been liable if a customer rented defective tomahawks from you and got hurt (or~ in the more likely scenario~ if a customer has some sort of climbing accident while using your gear and sued you),1
6505,I've always assumed liability concerns was the reason that climbing gear rental businesses don't exist.,1
6506,Hi Erik~,1
6507,Sounds like he is going to take care of it~ not much he can do beyond that?  Glad the problem got taken care of,1
6508,I think he should be proactive and inform retailers~ who will then inform customers who have ordered the pitons,1
6509,At least I haven't yet gotten an email from the store I ordered them from,1
6510,I don't think he should expect people to searching the web every other day to check if any safety issues regarding their gear have come to light..,1
6511,All sorts of stuff can happen to those tools,1

6514,It may look fine in the go/nogo gauge and still pull out at less than the cable BS,1
6515,Hi Russ and Dante~ Thanks for your professional insights! I probably will never trust a swaged cable again~ haha! I was wondering if the cables that come with nuts are swaged too~ or if that is some other kind of connection (e.g.~ soldered)?,1
6516,I just informed Rock and Snow~ which is where I bought the pitons from,1
6517,They were not yet aware of the issue!  Shouldn't be like that!!,1
6518,Hi Russ and Dante~ Thanks for your professional insights! I probably will never trust a swaged cable again~ haha! I was wondering if the cables that come with nuts are swaged too~ or if that is some other kind of connection (e.g.~ soldered)? Nuts are swaged too..,1
6519,but~ the larger the company the LESS likely there will be a failure,1
6520,But with that being said~ this should NEVER happen,1
6521,It just CANT happen...,1
6522,but it did~ meaning Moses was not doing ALL THEY COULD to insure the quality of the swages on their gear,1
6523,That is troubling at best~ and negligent at worst.,1
6524,Yuki~ I sincerely apologize that the gear failed you when you needed it most and you had this accident,1
6525,There are no excuses for this,1
6526,I strive to uphold a high degree of craftsmanship in all the items I make,1
6527,I am saddened that I have not lived to up to that and you suffered a fall because of it,1
6528,I have ceased manufacturing of climbing products while I am reevaluating all the manufacturing that I do,1
6529,I may just drop all cabled product from my line up or all climbing products,1
6530,I don't like to be kept up at night worrying about my products being a risk to climbers,1
6531,Link to webpage statement:http://mosesclimbing.us/product-safety-advisory/mosesclimbing.us/product-sa… I have contacted the affected dealers so they can spread the word and I can replace the cables as soon as possible,1
6532,Please send Tomahawks for repair to: Moses Enterprises 6941 C Sycamore Rd,1
6533,Atascadero~ CA 93422 I am sorry for any inconvenience this puts on anyone,1
6534,Sincerely~ Theron Moses,1
6535,Classy response~ Theron,1
6536,Nice.,1
6537,Hi Theron~,1
6538,I have come to find that Fish products are worthy of bigwalls,1
6539,Other brands~ not so much.,1
6540,The cables on beaks~ even the thicker (#3~ but not as thick as #4) one that Moses uses~ do not hold up well,1
6541,Worse~ the wires typically start to come apart a few at a time~ causing many pokey little things that irritate you while you're climbing (they don't just wear out~ or break~ they just break a few little wires at a time~ so they still look good but have pokey spikes sticking out and are compromised~ strength-wise)......just taking the cables off all the beaks~ because they don't work~ seems like an easy common sense solution.,1
6542,Russ doesn’t make beaks,1
6543,Moses are the best thing going save for the recent hiccup,1
6544,Dude if you used them before those cables where compromised by you~ I always back up sling my beaks and I carry boat loads of webbing and cord to re sling with because I’ve had swagges blow,1
6545,Welcome to the world of aid climbing~ ya gotta improvise and back up your gear,1
6546,We all sling up our bd beaks because we know they are thin~ Moses cables are better but just one hammer hit can compromise so its on you for whipping and not being caught~ no one else,1
6547,Honestly if your blaming Moses has stoped him from doing the public service he does~ that’s on you~ we all accept the risks of what we do~ we think for our self and back our cables up because that’s what we do,1
6548,If your complaining about taking a whip on an A2 pitch just go sport climbing in boulder canyon,1
6549,We all do dangerous stuff~ yer gunna diiii~ it’s not on Moses to be responsible for our lives~ thats on us~ he just welds the tools that we use to make our own decisions,1
6550,That makes no sense at all,1
6551,When I buy a piece of pro~ I pay the manufacturer to sell me a product I can rely on,1
6552,I shouldn‘t have to question every pieces strenght,1
6553,If the cable is kinked or partially destroyed~ it is on me to repair it,1
6554,It‘s not a climbers job to question a relatively new product if it still looks good.,1
6555,I wonder if Theron wants you speaking for him? I’d doubt he’d want this message directed at a customer who just stared down two consecutive coffin nails that came out of his shop and yet has seemingly forgave him,1
6556,He’d probably say that’s on you.,1
6557,Nuts are swaged too..,1
6558,but~ the larger the company the LESS likely there will be a failure,1
6559,But with that being said~ this should NEVER happen,1
6560,It just CANT happen...,1
6561,but it did~ meaning Moses was not doing ALL THEY COULD to insure the quality of the swages on their gear,1
6562,That is troubling at best~ and negligent at worst,1
6563,How many rivit hangers~ copperheads~ and other swagged cable items were made in Camp 4 or at the Deli by Tucker and Russ?,1
6564,Theron~ PLEASE continue making Tomahawks,1
6565,They are the best beak pitons available~ by a long shot,1
6566,Sorry to hear that the cables are no good on recent batches but I will always have complete faith in the pitons themselves.,1
6567,So now I have a question,1
6568,How strong are the pins themselves? I hadn't even realized they were considered body weight only placement until I read the safety advisory,1
6569,I've heard of them catching falls and being placed as pro on free climbs,1
6570,Is this just the same as placing an RP? I assumed they looked pretty damn strong~ am I wrong?,1
6571,Please read the story carefully! The cables were brand-new and what failed was the SWAGE connection~ NOT the cable!,1
6572,Big Wall climbing is funny.,1
6573,Hayden! Believe me or not but I've had plenty of time to reflect on the risks I take in the past 13 years I've been climbing and mountaineering~ and I've had several falls and accidents that were much more serious that this one~ resulting in real injuries (so no need to educate me dude!),1
6574,Am I responsible for what I do? YES! Am I responsible to check my gear for wear and tare? YES! Am I responsible for a fall caused by a manufacturing error? NO (period!) We all have to rely on gear that we buy! What would you say if your brand-new harness with no signs of damage came apart all of a sudden???,1
6575,Hi Russ and Dante~ Thanks for your professional insights! I probably will never trust a swaged cable again~ haha! I was wondering if the cables that come with nuts are swaged too~ or if that is some other kind of connection (e.g.~ soldered)? Yup~ typically wired nuts are swaged (not small brass HB's/DMM Imps etc wireds which are soldered),1
6576,The thing is~ places like Black Diamond and DMM have mfg and testing tools and protocols in place to test product before it goes out the door,1
6577,You can get that with scale as they crank out a lot of product,1
6578,BD/Chouinard use to test all things to 1/2 of their ultimate strength before they shipped,1
6579,We got into doing cable assemblies for a worldwide Mfg,1
6580,"The assemblies were eye to eye 12"" long 1/16 PVC with SS wire which were used on cabinet doors to keep them from opening all the way",1
6581,Started out making a couple hundred~ next thing we knew we were getting orders for thousands,1
6582,Ours were testing out to 195ft lbs approx~ which was overkill for that application,1
6583,Not so much if you weight 200lbs and are standing on it half way up El Cap,1
6584," At approx 10~000 1/16"" sized swedges~ the Nicopress jaws would start to break via hairline cracks",1
6585,I'm putting this up there for Theron to eyeball,1
6586,Cagey old fucks like Russ at Fish or John Yates most likely figured this out when I was still pre-sperm/egg so this is for those who don't know it,1
6587,Eventually~ we did a Pneumatic press with hardened steel tooling which was faster and longer lasting,1
6588,Might have lasted forever if the business hadn't gone to China,1
6589,"We still do a few hundred larger cables (1/8"" x 3') every 6 months and the manual Nicos work fine for that as it's not worth tooling up for the Pneumatic press.",1
6590,Hey Theron~ Many thanks for the great responses to the cable issue,1
6591,Sounds like you’re dealing well with it,1
6592,Back in my Trango days we had 3-4 recalls and I found that the best way to deal with it was to get out in front of it as soon possible,1
6593,In each case~ I personally got on the horn and call every dealer who we had shipped the suspect product to~ followed up with a brodcast fax (remember those?) to all dealers~ regardless of whether they’d bought the suspect product or not,1
6594,The next day I’d call every climber friend I knew who was likely to have purchased or been given the product and ask them to return it,1
6595,If it was a product we’d shipped to REI they’d make us file a report with a CPSC within a few days,1
6596,Funny thing with the CPSC was that when we’d hear back from them~ usually 2-3 years after our recall was over and all the suspect products had been inspected~ replaced or destroyed~ their response was always that our defective product didn’t create a significant danger to public safety and we didn’t have to do a recall,1
6597,We’d always get a laugh out of that,1
6598,I wish I’d saved and framed those letters,1
6599,Whatever~ let me know if I can help I any way~ Mal,1
6600,Good for you - another opportunity to shill for your business,1
6601,And another opportunity to be a knob for you,1
6602,Well done.,1
6603,Moses: Please keep selling the 'hawks dude!  They are the best on the market!,1
6604,Hmmm,1
6605,I got some of those this season that I wiIl have to thread with chord,1
6606,I really like the Tomahawks,1
6607,Krukonogi makes nice beaks now too,1
6608,I still love the Black Diamond #3~ but it has its own cable issues..,1
6609,Japan-john,1
6610,Bummer about Yuki's fall and the Moses swaging issue,1
6611,It would probably be a good idea for a manufacturer to have a test program for any life safety climbing gear,1
6612,Testing swages on a regular schedule wouldn't be hard to do,1
6613,All that is required is a load cell and something to apply a force.,1
6614,Bought this tent on sale at the end of summer,1
6615,Super excited about the space given its pretty light!  Has anyone used this in rough conditions? Planning to take it to Aconcagua and hoping to hear someone's reviews and its ability to stand up to the wind,1
6616,Yes read that one,1
6617,Actually emailed the writer but never heard back,1
6618,Not sure it anwsers my question,1
6619,Plus they have actually changed the hooks the secure the tent body to the poles since that review so it’s in there a tad stronger,1
6620,The tent is being sold as 4season/expedition but is knew and hasn’t been proven on Denali~ Aconcagua~ etc,1
6621,My plan is to bring it and happy to prove it but just looking to see if any one else has so I’m not totally blind,1
6622,I'm looking at potentially grabbing one of these myself,1
6623,How'd it work for you?,1
6624,I used it on Aconcagua it was fantastic and plenty strong~ PM me for more details,1
6625,Don't be bashful~ post your impressions,1
6626,I'm sure lots of people who come across this thread will be curious,1
6627," Yeah I bought this tent last year but do to a torn ACL did not get to put it through any paces in CO~ I""m hoping to bring it to Denali in a few years.",1
6628,so would love to hear your insights on how it worked for you,1
6629,I can not say enough good things about the  tent! I took it too Aconcagua last winter (summer down in South America),1
6630,I was originally planning on using it as a base camp tent and brining a second lighter tent for high camp,1
6631,But we went over our weight limit so only brought the Chogori,1
6632,It did fantastic and it’s light enough that carrying it up was not a big deal,1
6633,We had some very windy days on Aconcagua and it held up great,1
6634,I added guy lines of course but as long as it is guy’d out securely we had no problems,1
6635,We had one night when we came down from high camp and didn’t guy out the tent,1
6636,Once the winds picked up we had to secure the tent but once guy’d out zero problems,1
6637,The inside is HUGE! We had two people in it plus all of our gear and still had space,1
6638,You could easily fit three people fairly comfortably and fit four if the conditions required in a pinch,1
6639,I’m a big fan of exoskeleton tents I think the set up it’s just way better,1
6640,I also have a Hilleberg with the exoskeleton set up,1
6641,My one complaint is in the winds it’s a bit noisy but what are you gonna do that’s a fairly small complaint,1
6642,Plans to use on Denali as well,1
6643,Awesome~ thanks for the info,1
6644,I’m gonna go ahead and order one right now.,1
6645,That's re-assuring Thanks for the review!  That thinish fabric had me a bit worried,1
6646,Glad to hear it's strong,1
6647,Thinner fabric had me hesitant to order as well originally,1
6648,I really want to hear if anyone takes it to Denali though I’m willing to be a tester lol,1
6649,we used ours on denali this year and a couple wild winter outings in glacier and other montana spots last year,1
6650,great space and held up to some tough nights,1
6651,really comfortable for 2 to hang gear/not suffocate and we even 4 upped it (3 of us over 6ft) one night at 17k~ which was absurdly warm but manageable size wise,1
6652,easy to set up~ and free standing - which was a requirement for us,1
6653,at 6' and 6'4~ it's pretty nice to have the headspace over a significant period of time,1
6654,weight seemed comparable to other true 4 season outfits.,1
6655,Got one of these Saturday at REI,1
6656,Seems like a nice medium sized locker,1
6657,Used it cleaning sport routes,1
6658,The screw gate has a nice feel to it,1
6659,Easy to spin but gradually slows as you get to fully open or fully closed,1
6660,Liked the action better than the metolius element and bravo,1
6661,The screw felt better than my petzl Screwgate as well,1
6662,Felt pretty lightweight too,1
6663,Happy with my purchase,1
6664,Hadn't seen many reviews online so I thought I would throw my first impressions out there.,1
6665,i will say~ i hate BD carabiners~ but the hotforge ones are actually..,1
6666,good feeling,1
6667,they finally spent the time to get the gate action right,1
6668,and the lockers are pretty light feeling~ if that's your thing.,1
6669,Funny..,1
6670,it took taking production to Taiwan to make a nice carabiner,1
6671,Funny..,1
6672,it took taking production to Taiwan to make a nice carabiner the thought occurred to me too...,1
6673,Thanks for the quick review but for myself~ Meh,1
6674,50 grams with an 18mm gate opening? Not that special,1
6675,Grivel's Plume Nut weighs 37 grams and has a gate opening of 19mm ( they say~ it seems small to me),1
6676,DMM's Sentinal comes in at 54grams with a 20mm opening and you can rappel via Munter (Italian Hitch) off of it.,1
6677,PAS?,1
6678,Funny..,1
6679,it took taking production to Taiwan to make a nice carabiner Boom.,1
6680,handled in person...not impressed.,1
6681,So hot,1
6682,Such screwgate,1
6683,Much forge,1
6684,But it begs the question - why do you need a screwgate to clean sport routes?,1
6685,Some people when you get to chain or rings pass a bight through tie an 8 and clip a locker to it,1
6686,Additionally  the infamous PAS usually has a locker on the end,1
6687,Anyone wanna fill me in on the PAS issue? I use one~ what am I missing? Is it considered Gumby gear or something?,1
6688,Several vocal experienced climbers are totally against the use of a PAS to the point that some will not even climb with you if you use a PAS,1
6689,Other very experienced climbers like and use them,1
6690,The complaints against the PAS boil down to: A PAS is unnecessary because you can use draws (alpine draws in multipitch environment) or the rope to accomplish the task,1
6691,A PAS adds to the cluster of gear on your harness and belay loop,1
6692,Many PAS~ but not all PAS~ are made from static material (dyneema) so a slip onto the achor can have catastrophic results~ especially if you have climbed above the anchor,1
6693,Personally~ I find a PAS useful and use one,1
6694,I use the Petzl Connect which is made with a dynamic rope that can handle 5 fall factor 2 falls onto the anchor keeping the load in the safe range,1
6695,(not any worse than falling on the rope onto the the anchor),1
6696,Although I understand the complaints against the PAS~ I find the hate of PAS~ especially PAS made of dynamic material~ unjustified,1
6697,Use one if you feel the convenience of always having an easy clip into the anchor or gear outweighs the weight~ cluster or static nature of some PAS,1
6698,Positron screwgate weighs 54 grams but has a 21mm opening,1
6699,You can find good deals on these since they've been around for many years.,1
6700,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlLMlJ2tDkg,1
6701,This,1
6702,I was using a QD as a personal anchor~ though this weekend I will be using a sling girth hitched to my belay loop.,1

6713,Been using the metolius one~ but like the connect idea~ guessing you use the dual for anchor cleaning?,1
6714,Been using the metolius one~ but like the connect idea~ guessing you use the dual for anchor cleaning? Doug~ in case you haven't seen it~ check out this great series of photos from the AAC for a way to clean sport anchors that only requires a quickdraw and a locker,1
6715,Because you never go off belay and you're always connected to the rope~ you don't need any additional locking capability or redundancy,1
6716,Plus~ it's fast and simple.,1

6719,Plus~ it's fast and simple,1
6720,I've done it that way but some that I climb with give me shit because it wears the rings compared to rappelling,1
6721,Been using the metolius one~ but like the connect idea~ guessing you use the dual for anchor cleaning? I hardly ever sport climb,1
6722,Last time was about 2 years ago,1
6723,If I feel the need I clip an alpine draw to both bolts and clip the connect adjust to either a sliding x or an overhand knot.,1
6724,Clean-nose Carabiners: CAMP Dyon Carabiners are the cornerstone to every climber’s gear cache,1
6725,You use them to connect yourself to your rope~ your rope to your partner~ your rope to your gear~ your gear to your harness,1
6726,This is why we typically have more carabiners than anything else~ and why picking the right carabiner is so important,1
6727,This review is about the biner used for 90% of tasks — racking~ clipping into rope~ and clipping into gear,1
6728,A standard double rack will contain about 42 of these (12 draws + 18 cam/nut racking biners) so optimizing your choice here is the best approach to lighten up your rack and improve the functionality of your connections,1
6729,Carabiner technology is constantly improving,1
6730,Light clean-nose carabiners are the evolution of the wire-gate — reducing snagging to improve usability and safety,1
6731,Snags of the rope or a sling sometimes are the difference between a closed~ correctly oriented carabiner and a cross-loaded or open one~ which is about 50% as strong,1
6732,CAMP does a good job striking a balance between weight and usability by being innovative with materials and design,1
6733,I love what they’ve created with the Photon Wire carabiner – it’s the lightest full-size carabiner out there – but it has obvious weaknesses: The gate tension is pretty soft~ it can be awkward to hold~ and it has a conventional snaggy hook nose,1
6734,For a long time I thought CAMP had a chance of making the best carabiner in the category if they could deal with these issues,1
6735,With the new Dyon~ did they? This new carabiner has an exceptionally asymmetric body~ and an interesting new hybrid wire-gate design~ facilitating a clean-nose lightweight carabiner,1
6736,This is intended to be a multi-part~ on-going review – starting off with first impressions and some nerdy measurements,1
6737,I’ll try to update this review every few weeks,1
6738,The weight of a carabiner is an important consideration when carrying a big load of gear,1
6739,Saving 10g per biner adds up to about a pound for a double rack,1
6740,I weighed a bunch of biners I had laying around using my fancy chemical scale (Table 1),1
6741,The Dyon is 2g heavier than the Photon Wire and lighter than the other full size biners,1
6742,The Ange S and Nano 22 are lighter~ but those are in a different category of carabiner focused on weight savings,1
6743,For me~ these sacrifice performance~ especially in ice climbing,1
6744,Figure 1 shows the other biners I measured,1
6745,Note that the Photon Wire and Nano 22 used for comparison here are last year’s model (CAMP recently updated these),1
6746,The Nose width determines how easy it is to clip into gear,1
6747,Old pins and chain links can be pretty narrow and indeed I’ve had issues clipping into things with the BD Hoodwire’s impressive 11.5mm nose (I measured the widest part of the nose with my fancy calipers in Table 1),1
6748,The Dyon has the smallest nose by an onion skin (very similar to the others from CAMP) so it shouldn’t have issues clipping into the gnarliest Weissner pins still occupying Gunks cracks or the exact chain link that will give you just enough extension to reach that ledge but not interfere with the rappel ropes,1
6749,Figure 2 shows the profile of a Dyon compared to a Photon Wire,1
6750,The width of the top of the basket of the carabiner is important for racking,1
6751,You can fit fewer racking carabiners on a gear loop if it’s wider at the top,1
6752,1mm may not seem like much of a difference on its own but for 10 cams it can make all the difference between too tight to unclip comfortably and just fine,1
6753,I measured the top of the basket at the widest part of each carabiner in Table 1,1
6754,The winner of thinnest profile is the Oval Wire~ so you should use those to rack all of your pitons and hexes,1
6755,A close second is the Nano 22 at 7.9mm~ then Dyon~ Photon and the Ange S at ~9mm,1
6756,The Dyon has the same light hand-feel (density?) as a Photon Wire and the finish is high quality,1
6757,Gate action is much tighter than a Photon Wire and it's definitely more natural to hold,1
6758,The spine is radically different (convex vs concave) and to me that makes all the difference in ease of handling (Figure 3),1
6759,Manipulating the gate feels ergonomic and natural as the thumb naturally gravitates toward a little notch at the bottom of the receiver (the new piece at the end of the wire-gate),1
6760,The inner surface of the carabiner has very pronounced grooves on the major axis to keep things oriented correctly~ but 2 areas are potentially prone to snagging (Figure 4),1
6761,The rivet end of the gate is flat (blue arrow)~ making an abrupt angle coming out of the crotch of the carabiner (small end opposite the basket),1
6762,Another potential area is at the point where the receiver sits on the nose on the inner surface creating a very small~ smooth bump (green arrow),1
6763,I don’t know if they are actually prone to snagging yet~ but I’ll be testing that,1
6764,Some carabiners have a hole in the gate which can help reduce freezing / jamming due to accumulation,1
6765,The receiver pocket in the Dyon does not have such a hole (Figure 5~ green arrow),1
6766,The open-gate strength of the Dyon is 11kN,1
6767,That’s higher than any other Aluminum carabiner I know of,1
6768,The combination of reduced snagging and increased strength is actually a huge step up in safety,1
6769,Aside from general usability~ clip-ability~ and feel~ I plan to specifically evaluate: -How likely is the pocket to collect debris~ ice~ and freeze? -How likely is the gate to open against rock if not properly managed? -What is the tendency of the above-described features (Fig 4) to snag? Stay tuned! Full disclosure: I received a set of Dyon biners and QDs for the purposes of this review~ but all opinions~ observations~ and measurements expressed here are my own,1
6770,Update #1 (6/20/17): Review of Dyon Quick Draws following field testing CAMP is making 3 types of Dyon Quick Draws (QDs),1
6771,One with 2 Dyons with the skinny sling~ 2 Dyons with a wide sling~ and a hybrid Dyon+Photon straight-gate with a wide sling,1
6772,I took the QDs out for late-season ice and really enjoyed using them,1
6773,They are light and easy to clip with gloves on,1
6774,So far no issues with gate freezing,1
6775,I used the Dyon QDs alongside Chimera~ Alpha Trad~ Alpha Sport~ and BD Oz QDs for sport climbing,1
6776,For sport climbing weight is much less important and typically I prefer something super beefy with a wide dogbone like the DMM Alpha Sport but I really liked the wide-sling Dyon and Dyon-Photon QDs,1
6777,For reference~ the weight difference between the Dyon  and wide-sling DMM/Petzl QDs is about 20-30g per QD,1
6778,I’m not going to try to grade clipping / handling but after getting used to them my partners and I had no significant issues,1
6779,The tight gate tension on the Dyon is very noticeable at first and requires conscious adjustment,1
6780,The super skinny nose is maybe my favorite feature of the Dyon because it makes them SO easy to clean on steep terrain and it fits much more easily into a bolt hanger already occupied by another draw or rusty link compared to chimeras~ Oz~ or Alphas,1
6781,On the photon in the hybrid QDs~ the gate is notched (like the Petzl Spirits and DMM Alpha Sport)~ which adds feedback and improves handling,1
6782,The mixed QD is also easier to mount on the beta clip stick I use than the all-Dyon ones because the Dyon gate tends to slip out of the metal clip that holds the gate open,1
6783,The mixed QD is a couple bucks cheaper too,1
6784,Overall these are really nice QDs that can be used for a wide range of styles because of low weight and good performance,1
6785,Thanks for your detailed review (thus far) and look forward to hearing more,1
6786,Some thoughts on lightweight carabiners (and reviews of them in general),1
6787,"Most of these thoughts are rooted in anecdotal experience rather than ""data""~ but for me this is more important than just about every carabiner stat except weight",1
6788,These are the kinds of things I want to think about (not the numbers) when considering gear purchases,1
6789,1) You mention nose width,1
6790,I agree that a narrow nose is much easier to slot through gear (and pins),1
6791,Hoodwires (and their OZ brethren) are terrible in this regard,1
6792,The ANGE is by far the best I've ever used (though they have other problems),1
6793,"However~ you also mention a narrow ""basket width"" as being an advantage for racking~ and while I agree with this I also think that a wide basket generally equates to a wider rope bearing surface which is much easier on the rope",1
6794,The horrible~ narrow radius of a Nano 22 is the major reason I won't use them,1
6795,2) CAMP is notorious for having QC issues with their lightweight carabiners - mainly with their gates,1
6796,There are many posts out there about the crappy Photon gates and I've seen so many Nanos in the field with sticky gates that it is a red flag,1
6797,"Furthermore~ while these two carabiners are shockingly light~ and good ""on paper""~ they also feel frighteningly thin - no big deal when circumstances are perfect but lay one over a tiny edge or bump and~ personally~ I start worrying that they'll snap right in half",1
6798,The OZ is the same way,1
6799,I know that loading a biner the wrong way can break ANY carabiner~ but I prefer a bit more metal even at the expense of weight/size..,1
6800,The Neutrino~ for example~ feels more burly~ as do carabiners with more pronounced I-beam designs (Helium~ Spirit~ ANGE),1
6801,"And regarding overall quality~ just pick up a DMM Chimera or Phantom (or even a Metolius FS Mini) and it simple ""feels"" way better than a Photon or Nano",1
6802,Tighter tolerances~ stiff and even gate tension~ etc,1
6803,3) Usability..,1
6804,not just how easy it is to clip and unclip~ but does it rack well (and slid off a gear loop easily) and does it stay oriented on a sling (or does it tend to invert or worse~ cross load)?    CAMP is doing some things right - lots of colors for racking (hello PETZL?!) and relatively low cost,1
6805,I'm curious to see how the Dyon stacks up..,1
6806,Thanks again for the review.,1
6807,Hey Josh -- thanks for your comments,1
6808,This is exactly what I'm looking for as I carry on with the review process,1
6809,In my assessments I try to deal as much as possible with objective measures,1
6810,How many times have you read a glowing review about how a product feels and functions in one reviewer's hands~ only to be surprised when you pick it up yourself? I will for sure describe usability but will always try to bring it back to facts such as measurements and widely-recognized references~ to give you the best depiction of how something really looks~ feels~ and works,1
6811,With both the Photon (which I have many of) and the Nano (which I don't) CAMP has made pretty compelling though flawed products,1
6812,The are both among the lightest carabiners available for their respective sizes~ and on top of that they are also super cheap,1
6813,Downside is this shows in the weak~ sticky gates (which I see in my own Photons),1
6814,A serious flaw~ but I'd say top 3 criteria for a biner is going to be weight~ gate~ and cost,1
6815,It's usually a game of pick 2~ they did light+cheap fairly well,1
6816,At $15/biner and focused on a fancy gate~ the Dyon really needs to be compared against the other biners that prioritize weight+gate at expense of cost,1
6817,WC Helium~ DMM Alpha Light (also Chimera~ Phantom~ and other alpha variants)~ etc,1
6818,Saying it's lighter and nicer than the Hoodwire or Photon doesn't mean much when those are $6-7 a biner,1
6819,Anyways~ thanks for your work on a review~ just some of my thoughts on the topic,1
6820,The Dyon does look pretty neat,1
6821,And of course you don't have access to every biner on the market and you're just working with what you have.,1
6822,Buy heliums,1
6823,End of story.,1
6824,Wow,1
6825,Really?,1
6826,Well~ I handled a Dyon today and I was surprised by it: The build quality seems a bit better than other CAMP carabiners (Photons and Nanos); the gate tension was firmer and the tolerances seemed tighter,1
6827,It seemed very clippable.,1
6828,So I was at the gear shop today and fondling away and I was comparing the dyon with the photon that I currently use for lots of my draws and some of my racking biners,1
6829,I noticed that the photons got a nice little update and here's my comparison of all three (old photon~ new photon~ dyon): The old photons had the worst spring action~ really weak and scratchy and the dyons had a much stronger spring action while the new photons were somewhere in between,1
6830,I've never had sticky gate issues with my photons or nanos but the issue is well documented,1
6831,I think the dyons would do a lot better in this regard as the spring just felt much more robust,1
6832,I liked the shape of dyons much better than the photons as it is much less clunky and more curved,1
6833,The new photons are a bit better than the old ones in this regard but nowhere near as good as the dyon,1
6834,For me the new photons were tied with the dyons in ease of clipping,1
6835,The dyon's shape made clipper easy~ but I liked the spring action better on the new photons,1
6836,I think the dyons filled a sort of void in CAMP's line of biners and I really like them,1
6837,However~ I don't think they will replace the photons for me for a few reasons,1
6838,First of all is the price point~ they are much more expensive then their photon and nano sibling,1
6839,They are also slightly heavier than the photons~ and while I like the snag free nose~ it's not a huge selling point for me personally because I don't really mind the lip on other biners,1
6840,With an adjustment to my hand movements~ I rarely get biners snagged except for Omega Pacific biners which are always horrible when it comes to snagging,1
6841,The snag free nose is probably my favorite out of the various snag free wiregate designs,1
6842,Updated,1
6843,More pictures coming,1
6844,Thanks,1
6845,I ended up replacing all my ANGE draws with Dyons.,1
6846,I think almost everyone has heard of this issue,1
6847,Unfortunate that they can produce such lightweight biners with good potential only to be undermined by the faulty gates,1
6848,However~ I've heard that CAMP is very easy to deal with when it comes to having any Photons/Nanos replaced due to a sticky gate,1
6849,Better to not have them stick in the first place~ but always nice to see a company committed to keeping your investment going.,1
6850,Correct,1
6851,I ran into that problem with Heliums (my favorite biners until i discovered the Dyon's) trying to clip some pins in Eldo,1
6852,Dyon's are by far the best biners I ever owned,1
6853,https://www.rei.com/product/110186/camp-usa-dyon-wire-straight-gate-carabiner On sale and add 25% off.,1
6854,Just got 10 of them for $72 including tax using my REI dividend! Anyone want to buy the 10 biners they are replacing for $25?,1
6855,Just got 10 of them for $72 including tax using my REI dividend! Anyone want to buy the 10 biners they are replacing for $25? Depends what they are? PM me,1
6856,Is it true that the Dyons are made in China?  Most people report their build quality and that of the new photons are OK,1
6857,But for me~ for human rights reasons~ I try to go for items not made in china,1
6858,If they are not~ I'd be happy to give them a try~ otherwise~ I will be going for Heliums..,1
6859,Dang these things are expensive (both) but ask me if it's worth it next time I'm way above my last piece and I'm struggling to get the biner in that cam sling and the biner keeps catching..,1
6860,TPC,1
6861,Probably made in Taiwan where 90% of carabiners are now made,1
6862,"  Camp Dyons are made in China definitely (reference is Sierra.com~ and some folks in the ""best snag-free~ light carabiner for trad"".) for what it's worth~ Heliums are Taiwan (ref: mec.com)~ DMM are Wales (ref: their videos and other web publications)~   Petzl biners are made in France (ref: mtntools.com) -TPC",1
6863,I've had at least 6-7 pairs over the years,1
6864,Yes~ they are very lightweight,1
6865,Yes~ the fabric is nice and stretchy for easy movement,1
6866,Yes~ the zipper pocket~ on the men's version~ fits a phone or Cliff bar really well,1
6867,However~ after years of loyal support and endorsement of these pants~ I've come to see the truth: Prana Zion Stretch pants really aren't that great,1
6868,First of all~ the fit is baggy~ loose~ and dumb-looking,1
6869,More importantly~ the fabric is softer than a Red Rocks trade route,1
6870,I've completely blown out the knees and butt on a pair of Zion Stretch pants in as little as six months,1
6871,My wife sews them back together~ but the patches just rip off,1
6872,The fabric isn't hearty enough to hold a stitch,1
6873,"Maybe if I was one of those pansy gym climbers~ dead set on ""ruining climbing~"" these pants would last me a few years",1
6874,But as an all-around rock climber~ I need something more durable,1
6875,I don't want to spend $85 every year~ and I definitely don't want to send a pair of pants to the landfill every year,1
6876," When I search the forums for ""climbing pants recommendations~"" I see page after page of people raving about the Prana Zion Stretch pants",1
6877,I get it,1
6878,I used to be like you,1
6879,However~ I suspect that many of us think the Zion Stretch pant is great only because we don't know any better,1
6880,There has to be a better pair of pants for rock climbers,1
6881,What do you got MP? Give me your recommendations,1
6882,I want something durable but also breathable and non-restrictive,1
6883,Eddie Bauer Horizon guide pantshttps://www.eddiebauer.com/product/mens-horizon-guide-chino-pants---slim-fit/10307991?showProducts=&color=225&sizetype=&size= Slimmer fit than stretch zions,1
6884,Same material so same durability concerns but there are sales regulary~ for instance I think they have 50% off going right now so $35 for them,1
6885,They have the guide pro and guide pro lined pants if you want more pockets or insulation.,1
6886,I’ve been climbing in the Zions for almost a decade and I still have my first pair- zero holes and probably 1000 pitches on ‘em,1
6887,Ymmv~ I guess.,1
6888,Wow I wonder if they've changed the fabric,1
6889,I've got one pair that both knees blew out on beyond repair,1
6890,My other pair I got a hole in the third day out,1
6891,Granted I had probably 80 days on the first pair,1
6892,That sucks..,1
6893,I have had the same green pair I wear nearly daily and climb/hike/range/etc,1
6894,in for the past few years (my GF stopped asking me to wear different pants a while ago),1
6895,They have held up in alpine~ swamp~ desert,1
6896,No other pair of pants has held up more than two days climbing without having some sort of hole~ especially Mountain Hardware,1
6897," The ""belt"" area sucks when your on a hanging belay for a while~ but the pants have more than lived up to my expectations.",1
6898,I like the wrangler 4 way stretch cargo pants,1
6899,the cut fits my legs well and they go on sale for like 15 bucks sometimes~ although at 25$ at full price they are still sorta cheap,1
6900,I climb OW in them and they have held up for 5 months so far,1
6901,I agree the Zion's are trash and so over priced its not even funny,1
6902,I have found that climbing in not climbing brand pants has been the way to go for me,1
6903,"For example~ when I first started I bought some expensive (>35$) BD pants that were supposedly the ""toughest"" climbing pants..",1
6904,shredded in 3 months at woodson,1
6905,I bought a pair of the stretchy deluth pants and am still rocking them over a year later.,1
6906,Wow I wonder if they've changed the fabric,1
6907,I've got one pair that both knees blew out on beyond repair,1
6908,My other pair I got a hole in the third day out,1
6909,Granted I had probably 80 days on the first pair,1
6910,I think this is it~ I bought a pair of the Khaki ones last year and they feel way different,1
6911," Wrangler ""Outdoor Comfort Flex Cargo Pant"" $22 at walmart",1
6912,I like the fit better and they're more durable than the patagonia equivalent of the Prana zions,1
6913,Maybe not as breathable~ but you can't beat the price...,1
6914,Same- except 8 years instead of 10,1
6915,I actually gave them to a friend a few months ago because I’m a 32 now instead of a 34 and cinched up they were still loose,1
6916,I’m not on rock every week though~ try as I might~ and I don’t do a ton of offwidth or otherwise abrasive climbing,1
6917,But I do wear them to work a ton,1
6918,There are probably more durable less expensive options out there though~ to be fair,1
6919,The latest versions are way less baggy than older ones imo- and I have skinny bird legs.,1
6920,I am looking for a good pair of climbing pants too,1
6921,I had been wearing La Sportiva solution pants and liked them fairly well,1
6922,Unfortunately they are no longer made,1
6923,I bought a pair of OR Ferrosi  pant from positive remarks in another thread,1
6924,I think they are really bad,1
6925,The material might be nice in the summer but it is very thin and already has pulled threads after 2 wearings,1
6926,Also the cut looks like is was made for a girl~ my wife won't let me wear them in public (and yes I checked mine are for men),1
6927,I bought a pair of Eddie Bauer guide pants mentioned above and they seem much better than the OR pants,1
6928,I am hoping they work out,1
6929,Somebody please make a good pair of climbing pants for a reasonable amount of money!!,1
6930,YESSIRRRRRRR,1
6931,Maybe my technique just sucks~ but even my “new” pair has the start of holes,1
6932,Same (except for the 1000 pitches~ unfortunately :( ).,1
6933,They recently came out with a slimmer cut and apparently are transitioning all their models to be slimmer,1
6934,That doesn't address your concern about durability,1
6935,I personally have three pairs,1
6936,One has a huge rip in the knee~ the other two are holding up well,1
6937,I don't climb much off-width~ but I do climb a lot of chimneys,1
6938,I mostly climb on sandstone with a little granite thrown in.,1
6939,I have a few pairs of the Zions and they've lasted better than any other pant,1
6940,I recommend them every time,1
6941,I just ground up some offwidth in Zion this past weekend and they held up great,1
6942,A couple pairs might have a few small holes~ but the holes stay the same size,1
6943,"They also make the ""Stretch Zion Straight"" as a slim fit if you don't like how baggy they are (which isn't a lot)",1
6944,If you climb offwidth on a regular basis~ then nothing will last that long~ but jeans seem to be the most durable.,1
6945,Useful thread!,1
6946,Sorry to hear the fabric isn't holding up since I just bought a pair of the Brion Pant which is the same fabric in a slimmer cut (still a little baggy in the lower leg though),1
6947,I was happy when I found these because they looked similar to the discontinued and very much missed Patagonia Rhythm pants~ which I believe Ron Kauk helped design,1
6948,They had the styling of a pair of jeans but with technical fabric similar to the Stretch Zion Fabric Prana is using,1
6949,Although it must have been different as I never had any durability issue with them,1
6950,The fabric finally wore so thin on the butt from years of use that I had to retire them out of respect for my belayers,1
6951,I actually think the Prana Brion pant would be about perfect for me if the legs were a little more tapered and the fabric was slightly thicker~ more durable,1
6952,But then that would make them less desirable on a hot day,1
6953,Note: Prana makes 5 styles of pant with Stretch Zion Fabric.,1
6954," I'm a stretch Zion fan and recently saw the ""slim"" version in a store",1
6955,I like that~ too,1
6956,If you want pants that you can ass-scoot in all day and not wear through then try some of the Kuhl pants,1
6957,They're really thick and tough,1
6958,Free Ryder model is really good,1
6959,Why wear pants at all?,1
6960,I agree,1
6961,Pants are aid,1
6962,Butt I feel bad for my partners when I go pantsless,1
6963,My Zion's barely lasted one Joshua Tree season~ maybe 30-40 days?  Rough rock / bad technique might apply,1
6964,I switched back to Kuhl pants,1
6965,I had a pair of them prior to the Zions that lasted a few years,1
6966,This time I purchased the 'Silencr Rogue Pant'~ about 10 days in and so far so good.,1
6967,So I don't grab the wrong rope ;),1
6968,Carhartts? Kuhl?,1
6969,U lern slow?,1
6970,I agree,1
6971,Pants are aid,1
6972,Butt I feel bad for my partners when I go pantsless,1
6973,F that,1
6974,Get your sparkle on,1
6975,Your partners should have the decency to stickclip some dollar$ to your pas thong,1
6976,Or they aren’t real climbers,1
6977,Maybe gym gumbos,1
6978,Or a trad pilaf,1
6979,Or maybe see if a black totem fits in the moon.,1
6980,I just bought a pair of the zion stretch pants~ the pocket doesn't fit my phone,1
6981,And it's not one of those huge phablets,1
6982,Just a samsung S8 with a thin case on it,1
6983,I find it impossible to buy pants,1
6984,"Being 5'9"" and not fat nobody seems to sell pants in my size",1
6985,30w/28l,1
6986," REI doesn't stock any pants under 32"" waist by me",1
6987,"WTF is up with that? I know my legs are short but there has to be a lot of climbers with a 30"" waist no?",1
6988,I'm offended on behalf of all pansy gym climbers.,1
6989,After 3 pairs in 3 years~ I agree with all these points~ and I've been on a journey to find pants I actually like,1
6990,I just blew the pocket on my third pair in a chimney last weekend,1
6991,If you climb trad~ these will get ripped in a season unless you have some sort of magical style points,1
6992,And they look goofy on slim people,1
6993,It's hard to find a pair of pants with decent material and a zipper pocket for the phone,1
6994,I bought a pair of the Patagonia Venga knickers off of their Worn Wear site~ and love them~ but apparently they've changed the fabric in the newer models and they have pretty poor reviews now,1
6995,Would love a rec.,1
6996,Try being size 29,1
6997,I have owned two pairs~ the first lasted multiple j-tree trips without any real damage and eventually became my staining pants,1
6998,The other pair however lasted exactly one climb in Red Rocks funny enough,1
6999,Even with a ten inch rip from the top of my butt down to my thigh I was not the worst dressed at the Vegas buffet afterward though,1
7000,Tommy Caldwell tried the dawn wall for 7 years and he’s a “hero.” I buy the same pair of lousy pants for 7 years and I’m a “slow lerner.”,1
7001,Why do people care how they look in climbing shit..,1
7002,this sounds like a gym climber trying to have his shirt off and flex for all of de womens in the gym,1
7003,I second the Zions not being durable enough because I went through 2 pairs in 6 months~ but I do climb lots of offwidths and chimneys,1
7004,I started using Gorilla tape to just tape them back together~ it actually lasts longer than when they're sewn,1
7005,I bought a pair of Carhartts (Carhartt Tacoma Ripstop Pants)~ but they got shredded on the second climb,1
7006,I bought a pair of the wrangler flex pants mentioned upthread https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073S71MFN but am yet to really thrash them~ they're comfortable though,1
7007,"Most of the ""durable"" pants I've found mentioned in previous threads don't come with a 34"" inseam~ which is what I'm looking for.",1

7022,My zions have lasted over a decade~ for almost all my climbing and hiking,1
7023,I don’t like chimneys and usually avoid offwidth though,1
7024,Zipper pocket started failing and a tree branch ripped a hole in the leg this year~ so I got a new pair,1
7025,It feels less baggy and thicker material,1

7036,Yeah~ he even talks about it in Dawn Wall.,1
7037,Lightweight and loose fitting work pants at Tractor Supply for $15,1
7038,I think if you are climbing alot of wide~ you're going to destroy any pant~ especially if you have really aggressive lower body technique,1
7039,Pants made of PVC (like a haulbag) might hold up~ but you probably wouldn't be able to walk in them,1
7040,I've found that pants marketed for summer Alpine climbing hold up well,1
7041,You'll pay dearly for them~ but my RAB sawtooth pants are clearly more durable and better made than anything Prana churns out.,1

7055,Very similar in weight~ but the Ferossi seem to handle rough stone better without getting torn,1
7056,I generally don't like a lot of zippers on a garment~ but the Ferossi' s are small and in the right place.,1

7080,These are the ones made of the heavier cotton (I think) material,1
7081,Tough as hell,1
7082,Eddie Bauer Guide Prohttps://www.eddiebauer.com/product/mens-guide-pro-pants/12951063 Large~ zippered~ cargo pockets easily fit my phone for taking mid-route pictures,1
7083,Stretchy enough for the highest of high feet,1
7084,So far the only wear they show is a loose thread after almost 2 years,1
7085,The warranty is sweet too~ any issue = refund or replacement.,1
7086,This is sound advice,1
7087,I do have a pair of Carhartt's that I break out for yard work and granite OW~ but I really don't want to own a quiver of pants,1
7088,"I think I'm hoping to replace my Zion with a more durable ""middle pant."" Agreed~ I'm not really bothered to carry an extra pair or two of shoes on a cragging day and put them on for specific climbs~ because I'm taking them on and off anyhow",1
7089,Bringing a few extra pairs of pants to the crag to change before a climb doesn't sound so great,1
7090,It is valid advice if you're only doing one style of climbing that day~ but that often doesn't happen,1
7091,Are those made from the same fabric as the Ferrosi Summit jacket? If so~ take my money,1
7092,Yes~ is it woven by faeries out of magic spider silk.,1
7093,Yes~ is it woven by faeries out of magic spider silk,1
7094,The Ferrosi hoodie is indeed a magical garment,1
7095,Eddie Bauer~ the guide pros are nice~ unfortunately the cargo pocket will blow out in your first week of climbing in them,1
7096,The pocket isn’t structural~ so they are still good pants~ you just lose the only functionally sized thigh pocket I’ve ever seen on any brand of climbing pants,1
7097,They just keep warrantying them for me though,1
7098,The horizon guides are the same or similar material,1
7099,I’ve beat the crap out of my pair,1
7100,Lots of chimneys~ lots of thorns,1
7101,Any they have one little pin hole where they got burned.,1
7102,PatMas~ you should check out the OR voodoo pant,1
7103,The zippered thigh cargo pocket I totally a functional size~ plus it is sewn internally thus no ripping off,1
7104,I’ve had mine for about 5-6 years and the only abrasion in the fabric is a tiny thing on the right leg,1
7105,I have used these for everything and they hold up to the abuse,1
7106,The only thing I can say is that after all this time some of the stitching is coming out/disintegrating~ but that is mostly the rear pockets~ from chimneys and butt sliding down stuff,1
7107,Easy enough fix and the fabric is still flawless,1
7108,Cargo pocket,1
7109,While we are piling on the Prana hate~ anyone else dislike how short the zipper on the fly is? (Insert dick measuring joke here),1
7110,When wearing a harness I hate relieving myself through that tiny opening~ so annoying,1
7111,The little plastic snaps to keep the pants rolled up seem unnecessary and annoying too,1
7112,For the Ferossi lovers~ have your pants pilled much? I am on my third pair,1
7113,I think my first pair~ probably 8 years old~ wore really well,1
7114,However my two newer pairs pilled like crazy in less than a year,1
7115,The Ferossi fabric probably still feels the best to me for climbing (lots of spandex~ 14%~ equals lots of stretch) but I think OR changes their materials a lot and not always for the better,1
7116,With the pilling and poor cuts on both the regular and crag pants version~ I think I am ready to move on from Ferrossis.,1
7117,The zipper is my only real gripe with the Stretch Zions,1
7118,When wearing a harness~ the bottom of the opening is just too close to the harness tie-in points,1
7119,It's definitely a hassle finagling past to answer nature's call.,1
7120,The only thing I really like about some climbing specific pants is the integrated belt,1
7121,With the ferossi pants I have to wear a belt which I hate when wearing a harness,1
7122,The wranglers look good and the price is right~ do they have an integrated belt?,1
7123,No only downside...,1
7124,I use the stretchy arcade belt which is fine.,1
7125,Has anyone else had the problem of the Stretch Zion fabric~ well..,1
7126,stretching? Every pair of Brion/Zion pants I've ever owned has lost its elasticity and turned baggy after a year or so of use~ sometimes much sooner than that (1 month in the case of a recent pair that I subsequently returned),1
7127,It's frustrating~ particularly as the Zions are baggy enough already and I buy the Brions because they fit so well out of the box,1
7128,I have only had one pair of the Ferossi~ so limited sample size~ but they withstood a solid week of climbing in Lumpy~ CCC and Eldo with no problems,1
7129,I can't tell they've even been worn,1
7130,Must be my impeccable technique    Seriously~ they are the best light pants I've ever owned,1
7131,I put the Zion in a medium weight category~ and I have two pair (weight loss).,1
7132,Lee Extreme Motion pants have been killer,1
7133,Wife found them at some random Target-like store and picked up a pair for me 2 years ago for xmas for under $30,1
7134,Great and wear to work~ gym~ outdoor climbing~ everywhere,1
7135,Strange how much they stretch but feel and look lke normal jeans,1
7136,Prob same materail that Prana and others use but so much cheaper and fit great,1
7137,Have 3-4 pair of Zions and are great travel pants - passport fits perfectly in side pocket~ stain resistant~ ok walk around and ok climb,1
7138,Not durable~ stick to my skin when sweaty~ but freezing when temp drops at all,1
7139,I'm always cold in them,1
7140,Waist is low and rlides down below my harness so my harness is against my skin,1
7141,Hate that feeling,1
7142,Climbing-specific pants (and tons of other things) are a play for our money and we can get the same stuff in a Carhart~ stretch jean from a 'normal' retailer~ etc for WAY less $..,1
7143," Its not a ""play"" for money",1
7144,Its a distribution thing.,1
7145,Yeah~ I worked at a small mom and pop in GJ for several years,1
7146,Very little these days is distribution problem as most companies re ultimately owend by the same compny that is delivering to Wally World down the street,1
7147,We actually stopped selling The North Face geaf fo a long time in GJ because we found the same stuff at Sam's Club down the street (for lower prices),1
7148,I love true mountaineering shops and support them when possible (although me wife did work at REI for a while running their community outreach program in ABQ),1
7149,Gear~ rock shoes~ service~ etc is worth a premium,1
7150,Prana jeans vs Wranglers is a business decision to get $ out of our pockets withought providing anything that we really need,1
7151,Look at the marketing,1
7152,The product descriptions,1
7153,Then do a blind pants test on your proj and tell me that the $ is worth it,1
7154,I agree with you to a limited extent~ but the fact is that they are trying hard to sell you something for a premium that you don't need~ regardless of whether there is a distrobution problem,1
7155,The mom and pop stores are in it for you~ but not necessarily the companies,1
7156,They realy don't care about you,1
7157,If they did~ they would agree that you should keep your extra $50 you earned and buy the Wranglers,1
7158,All of these companies get big,1
7159,I met the orriginal sewers for Marmot (3 spanish women in GJ),1
7160,Now they are a global marketing force,1
7161,Their gear is great~ and I'll spend the money for things that I need at a premium,1
7162,Not climbing pants,1
7163,I'd rather save $ on pants and give mom and pop the extra money for something special/unique they can provide,1
7164,Like sitting down with them and trying on every pair of climbing shoes to buy that perfect pair (and not writing down the size and ordering it online),1
7165,Or tryig on a loaded pack,1
7166,Or buying a guidebook and talking with the locals~ etc,1
7167,joe,1
7168,Back in the day~ they used to have velcro flies~ which would wear out and become prone to opening at unexpected times,1
7169,The zipper is an improvement.,1
7170,Back in the day~ they used to have velcro flies~ which would wear out and become prone to opening at unexpected times,1
7171,The zipper is an improvement,1
7172,I have a pair with the Velcro fly~ still holds great; easy open easy close for one handed wizz,1
7173,They bring in $50 million a year,1
7174,Or are we feeling sorry for the millionaires for getting picked on by the billionaires?,1
7175,They bring in $50 million a year,1
7176,Or are we feeling sorry for the millionaires for getting picked on by the billionaires? Prana didn't start that way and if you go to Outdoor Retailer you will see the dozens of small companies struggling.,1
7177,Prana didn't start that way and if you go to Outdoor Retailer you will see the dozens of small companies struggling,1
7178,You'd think with the internet the whole distribution thing would have gotten sorted out a decade ago,1
7179,Retail stores in some cute mountain town that are competing with an Amazon warehouse are relying on tourists who forgot their pants at home.,1
7180,I too have had better experience with Prana: I have one pair of ZION PANT.,1
7181,I can't say how old they are because I've had them so long~ climbed in them for several years,1
7182,The only thing I've had to repair is the front button,1
7183,Sewed a new one on and they're a-0kay! That said~ I don't like any of the new line of Zions~ they just don't feel right anymore,1
7184,I love my dead bird PSIPHON SL PANT,1
7185,They're my favorite for cool to moderate temps,1
7186,But I got them on clearance for $60~ I'd never pay full price for them,1
7187,My best alpine pant is the KHUL KLASH,1
7188,Holy smokes they're amazing~ early or late season alpine in the Sierra these things are a blessing,1
7189,Most comfortable and self-regulating pant I've every owned,1
7190,Soft shell-ish,1
7191,At Josh the only thing that gets wrecked are my sun shirts..,1
7192,pants never get thrashed; maybe I'm just not climbing hard enough,1
7193,Prana didn't start that way and if you go to Outdoor Retailer you will see the dozens of small companies struggling,1
7194,What is your point? Starting small is how companies start,1
7195,HP~ north face~ patagonia~ apple..,1
7196,they were all small and grew,1
7197,I'm sure there are lots of companies at OR that are trying to grow or get acquired,1
7198,Point is~ no need to hate on Prana because they were successful when so many small companies fail,1
7199,Buy the stuff or don't.,1
7200,Agree with you there,1
7201,I'm not inclined to pay $80 for climbing pants myself~ but I do have a bunch of their stuff i found on sale,1
7202,If anyone is interested....,1
7203,Prana Zion Stretch Pants go on sale starting next Friday (11/9) at REI for $62.,1
7204,Arborwear Flex pants~ like Carhartts but built for Arborists,1
7205,Literally work pants designed to be climbed in,1
7206,I've blown out a pair of pants pretty much consistently every 4 months since I was in highschool and these are the first pair I've ever owned that stand the test of time (admittedly I've only been wearing them 6 months~ but so far they're bomber),1
7207,Only downside is they're cotton which is a no-no if you're planning on getting them wet~ but who really wants to climb in the rain?,1
7208,So I finally got a few days to thrash those Wrangler Flex pants on some sandstone,1
7209,They seem less durable than the Zions,1
7210,The first offwidth pitch I climbed I put a hole in the left knee~ the second one a hole in the right knee,1
7211,They're thinner than the Prana Zions so it's not too surprising~ though I thought they might hold up better than that on sandstone,1
7212,After about 5 climbing days (mostly not offwidth) they had a number of holes in the knees,1
7213,The holes form similar to the Prana Zions though; they don't really rip~ the thread just kind of comes apart leaving a smallish hole that's fairly easy to patch,1
7214,A small bit of Gorilla tape on the inside and you're almost as good as new..,1
7215,Not sure if I'll buy another pair though,1
7216,The Zions cost 2-3 times as much~ but I think last 2-3 times longer.,1
7217,I don't find it that surprising that pants got a hole in the knee after a single pitch of sandstone OW,1
7218,Carhartts,1
7219,Nothing better.,1
7220,The most durable are cordura nylon or similar,1
7221,PVC would be really hot and sweaty,1
7222,Are any pants made from Cordura?,1
7223,I think there are several,1
7224,I have had 2 pair of these https://www.sportiva.com/solution-pant.html each of which lasted  2-3 years of really hard use,1
7225,Unfortunately the colors currently  available are so hideous I am looking for something else,1
7226,These are a bit warm as the cloth is reasonably thick; like jeans,1
7227,Same story here~ my zioneers are 6 years in going strong.,1
7228,The red pant looks ok,1
7229,yellow is for traffic safety~ Fire/rescue or visibility on mountains,1
7230,Only missing the reflective when lit up stripes,1
7231,“The Solution Pant is equally suited for day in~ day out climbing or the Saturday night pub-crawl” ha ha ha!,1
7232,Check these out~ yea gawdz!,1
7233,patience + eBay  Zions work great for me and I don't think I've ever paid over $40 for a pair,1
7234,Scored some new ones for less than $20 last week,1
7235,Update: I've been using the Wrangler Straight Fit 5 Pocket Pant from Walmart,1
7236,They are plenty stretchy for unrestricted movement,1
7237,The price is right,1
7238,I've mostly used them for bouldering and gym climbing as it's winter~ but so far they have held up well,1
7239,They definitely seem more durable than the Zion pant,1
7240,I bought a second pair,1
7241,Still wear mine at least a few times a week and most times climbing.,1
7242,They do make a slim fit pair,1
7243,Only ones i wear bow,1
7244,Girlfriend came home with a regular pair once~ and I took them right back for a slim fitting pair,1
7245,But your right~ they are not the best and for the price~ i fee they should be a bit more dirable in the knees,1
7246,These pant's inspiration?,1
7247,Update to my update: I bought that second pair of Walmart pants in February~ and the knee is already blown out,1
7248,"I've decided that ""It's not you; it's me."" Ask any of my partners: I use the ""alpine knee"" often",1
7249,It's like my signature move,1
7250,I've even thrown some double alpine knees when I'm really cruxin,1
7251,I think I have three options:,1
7252,My latest pairs of Prana Zions are disappointing,1
7253,My first pair was amazing~ and is still in good shape (but too big for me now--have lost a lot of weight since I started climbing),1
7254,But I've gotten three more pairs since then and they've all god holes,1
7255,If they were in the knees I would not care--not at all,1
7256,But they're in the groin area~ and while I think my boxers are nice~ I don't feel the need to show everyone,1
7257,Whatever changes they've made to the fabric or cut have made it so they don't tolerate Gunks high-step mantles.,1
7258," When I hear ""high step~"" I think ""alpine knee."" ",1
7259," When I hear ""high step~"" I think ""alpine knee.""  Haha! Yeah~ that works sometimes~ but:",1
7260,Update to my update: I bought that second pair of Walmart pants in February~ and the knee is already blown out,1
7261,"I've decided that ""It's not you; it's me."" Ask any of my partners: I use the ""alpine knee"" often",1
7262,It's like my signature move,1
7263,I've even thrown some double alpine knees when I'm really cruxin,1
7264,I think I have three options: When I was a boy and all the cool kids were wearing Levis~ my mother made me wear Toughskins from Sears,1
7265,Not only that~ she pre-emptively ironed patches into the knee area to prevent holes,1
7266,I'm sure that saved her some money but it also made me walk like the Tin Man before he got oiled,1
7267,I'm never happier than when I'm tearing holes in some pant knees as an adult.,1
7268,Whatever happened to white painter's pants? Anyone still climb in them? Along with the requisite rugby shirt and bandana (or Henry Barber hat)~ of course...,1
7269," ...and the red or green swami belt of 3"" webbing",1
7270,OW nuff said.,1
7271,Marc~ 6-8 wraps of 1-inch webbing will do!,1
7272,Of course! The wider webbing more stylish though,1
7273,I really don’t recall if it was 2” or 3”,1
7274,Honestly I patched the knees on mine after they broke through~ going strong with the newer tougher fabric on the knees..,1
7275,They took the repair well.,1
7276,I bought a pair of the Zioneer (slimmer version of the Zion) on sale 2 years ago~ and they are my favorite climbing pants hands down,1
7277,To each their own~ I guess,1
7278,“Gerry” stretch pants from Amazon are the poor mans Zion with a better slim fit~ stronger fabric and 1/3 the price,1
7279,I like that they are baggy and don’t fit like lady britches,1
7280,I hate that masculinity is so frowned upon now and men are forced to dress like women,1
7281,^ Maybe you are just embarassed that you have a flabby butt.,1
7282,What the literal f@&$# does this mean?!,1
7283,Holy shit Batman~ while I was reading this post I got an email  from Amazon about prAna Men's Standard Stretch Zion pants..,1
7284,So kids~ the MAN  is reading all of your correspondence and advertising based on content,1
7285,Either scary or pretty cool.,1
7286,What the literal f@&$# does this mean?! He's from Scotland.,1
7287,FWIW Wearing Stretch Zions now that I probably bought about 6 years back,1
7288,No holes yet,1
7289,Fabric is holding up fairly well,1
7290,While I have certainly used these in some chimneys~ if I know I'm doing any significant amount of chimney or OW I'll usually dress appropriately,1
7291,Disposable stretch denim jeans of some kind + knee pads under it~ disposable long sleeve shirt~ hopefully with a bit of stretch or oversized,1
7292,The stretch zions are kinda my summer light bushwhacking and climbing pants,1
7293,They don't handle cold well,1
7294,Kinda wish they had cargo pockets on both sides as I tend to overload the one with bars,1
7295,I had a pair of the Brions~ and they are better looking,1
7296,The size was wrong for me so resold them,1
7297,Lack of the built in waist belt was a detraction as well~ but now that I know how to sew that is not a concern any more,1
7298,Lack of a cargo pocket wasn't nice~ and that would be more annoying to try to add,1
7299,OR Ferrosi Pants are quite thin,1
7300,Unfortunately they are NOT the same material as found throughout the OR Ferrosi hoody..,1
7301,They appear to be similar to the thinner stretchy material found in just a small section near the cuffs to allow more stretch,1
7302,I was hoping they would be the same material as the bulk of the Ferrosi Hoody as I have one and it has lasted admirably,1
7303,I have put it on so often as bushwhacking pro or OW pro for shirts and fleeces~ or puffys when colder and significant chimney/OW pitches on a climb,1
7304,Yeah~ it has some holes forming~ but they are still small,1
7305,Mostly the fabric is just being abraded thinner and thinner near the lower back (I don't always tuck it under the harness) and a bit on the shoulders from OW,1
7306,(How much Chimney/OW? For the Ferrosi Hoody at least 4 laps on Chrysler Crack~ 3 trips up Tunnel Vision~ Group Therapy~ 5+ laps on the hard side of Plumbers Crack~ 2+ laps on the easy side~ 10+ laps on the easy dihedral OW behind plumbers crack~ and many other forgotten chimneys and short sections of OW.) As is the OR Ferrosi Pants are a nice light weight summer pant where I expect minimal bushwhacking,1
7307,Really very light,1
7308,Not what I would want to take up a chimney~ though I have done MysterZ in them twice now~ they have not handled it as well as I would expect the stretch zions to,1
7309,I have the feeling that they may handle cold breeze when your sweaty ever so slightly better than the stretch zions..,1
7310,But either way~ if your expecting that you should just use some other mildly softshell pants,1
7311,Destroyed one pair of American Eagle stretch denim jeans on OW so far,1
7312,Have a second to destroy still,1
7313,I should probably keep the destroyed pair and cut them up to add reinforcement to the intact pair,1
7314,Should not have gotten the legs quite so tight~ makes it hard to get knee pads underneath,1
7315,They look good though,1
7316,Waist stretches out with sweat as expected,1
7317,I'm curious how the Patagonia hemp blend stretch pants would holdup for OW.,1
7318,Duluth fire hose pants! Super durable~ more stretchy and warmer,1
7319,Ever since getting those I never wear my prana pants,1
7320,On my second pair of stretch Zions and I agree with original poster,1
7321,They tend to wear quickly,1
7322,In fact~ most performance climbing attire wears quickly~ especially if you abuse it~ chimneying~ bushwhacking~ and typical adventure climbing,1
7323,I recommend Target - soccer pants,1
7324,They give more range of movement and seem to actually last longer- although they are not very stylish - but whatever,1
7325,This is a definite for me too,1
7326,climbing friend~ everyone is knowing you cannot climb greater than 10d without lifestyle pant costing at minimum of 80 dollar just as you would not perform satisfactory yoga according to your instructor's fierce yet loving scrutiny without similar costing lifestyle pant if you do not wish to wear them~ it is acceptable,1
7327,just be honest with yourself~ and stop purchasing organic vegetable from whole foods,1
7328,(good god how is this thread still going?) OP is horrendously wrong,1
7329,The fit is only baggy if you have weak legs,1
7330,The size 35s that fit my waist are like yoga pants on my thighs,1
7331,I cannot even imagine what the point of the new slim fit version is,1
7332,They don't cost $80~ they cost $50~ because we're smart people that buy things on sale,1
7333,It helps that Prana changes colors every year so they go on clearance very predictably,1
7334,Buy on eBay~ or in the MP FS forum~ and you can spend even less,1
7335,I tried a pair of the $20 Costco zion-alikes mentioned in the deals thread~ and they just show why it's worth paying more for the Pranas.,1
7336,I see a few people recommending the Wrangler cargo pants,1
7337,I prefer synthetic pants,1
7338,Has anyone tried the ​Wrangler Authentics Men’s Performance Side Elastic Utility Pant​​​? Or similar? ​Wrangler Authentics Men's Comfort Flex Waist Nylon Pant​​​? ​Wrangler Authentics Men’s Performance Cargo Pant​​​?,1
7339,Yeah~ and we kick you know,1
7340,Yeah the slab climbers should be complaining that skinny pants are too tight on their calves,1
7341,Buy some wranglers and call it good.,1
7342,I have to disagree,1
7343,I got a pair last fall that I've been using non-stop indoors and out~ and they are still in awesome shape,1
7344,After several outdoor trips~ being covered and mud and scrapped over rocks~ they look almost new,1
7345,I for one will be buying another pair soon,1
7346,As far as looks go I partially agree; they are baggy and not exactly Lookers,1
7347,However that's kind of the point,1
7348,I buy them to climb in~ and for that I WANT them baggy.,1
7349,They did change fabric - i used to have a pair about 10 years ago which was great! Unfortunately I bought zion pants and shorts this summer and fabric started piling from harness after 3 or 4 days climbing..,1
7350,Very disappointed.,1
7351,And sports climbers who are stuck around mid 5.12,1
7352,Zion slim (straight) should have a better fit,1
7353,Zion is a hike/climbing pants~ and as such it's a bit baggy,1
7354,Tighter pants feel worse when sweaty/dirty,1
7355,Also checkout Brion,1
7356,Same pants without all the tech stuff like sinch belt and side pockets,1
7357,Fits a bit slim as well,1
7358,It just looks like a simple slack,1
7359,I wear it to my desk job~ I wear it on my dates~ I wore a new pair to a formal wedding~ I wear it to climb~ and I even wore it on a 10+ miles winter run without feeling much discomfort,1
7360,Now I wear Brion exclusively,1
7361,It's not that I don't want to wear them exclusively~ but I just don't see any point in any other pants,1
7362,Same,1
7363,Ive switched to Brion pants,1
7364,I wear them to work~ the gym and outside for climbing,1
7365,They fit more slim than the Zion pants~ which are too baggy for my taste.,1
7366,Add another vote for the Wrangler Flex Waist Outdoor Cargo,1
7367,My other pants are Prana (Brion~ Zion~ Bridger~ Bronson~ Axiom)~ one LuLuLemon ABC~ one Mountain Hardware AP~ one Eddie Bauer Guide Pro~ and some other off-brands ~ but I found these Wranglers to be more comfortable and more durable than most,1
7368,As far as fitment~ they're a little loose~ but not baggy,1
7369,They won't be winning any style awards but they're $25 dollars.,1
7370,Just tried Mammut’s Massone pants,1
7371,Comfortable and good fit but blew out the knees and seat in less than three months,1
7372,Never had pants blow out this quickly,1
7373,My pair of zoins are still running strong.,1
7374,that's a lot of pants,1
7375,climbing friend~ you will never receive love or flash even 5.12 if you just wear $20 jeans~ everyone is knowing the pant it must retails over $80~ if you would start hoping for any validations  or acceptance as human being,1
7376,Another vote for Wrangler 4 way stretch pants,1
7377,They say cargo style but the pockets are flush and don't bind like real cargo pants,1
7378,Cheap and durable as f#$k,1
7379,I have done offwidth at the voo and even cheese grated down a a scree slope and they don't even have a scratch on them,1
7380,Finally~ the definitive word on climbing pants,1
7381,Move along~ everyone,1
7382,This is my problem,1
7383,I haven't had many issues with durability per se~ but I hate how baggy my Brions have become after a couple years.,1
7384," I don't see a ""slim fit"" option.",1
7385,I have 3 pairs and I like them so far...I also only buy them when I find a deal on them...haven't paid more than $35 for a pair,1
7386,Kirklands stretch jeans ...they come in 5 colors are stretchy after and lasted 2 years with no holes,1
7387,17$ last time I looked,1
7388,Another option is any cheap stretchy jeans from Ross or TJX Maxx~ 15-25$ all day long,1
7389,I do love my Zion s but don't use them for climbing as they are quite baggy,1
7390,I have had a pair for 3 years and wear them regularly in deserts jungles and mountains all around the world~ sometimes for weeks at a time and they still look new except for the burn holes,1
7391,I’m wondering if anyone else climbs in these,1
7392,Basically with flat shoes it boils down to fit~ and quality of construction and stiffness preference,1
7393,Being an old school guy I picked these up on a whim because they reminded me of shoes I climbed in years ago,1
7394,Simple~ solid design,1
7395,They broke in in no time flat and remained stable unlike Mythos which just keeps on stretching,1
7396,These also feel a bit more precise than the Mythos,1
7397,They use the same rubber as Mythos~ TC Pros~ Miuras,1
7398,(Vibram Edge.) And for a wider foot guy they feel fantastic,1
7399,What’s not to like? The best part is since they are marketed as a beginner shoe~ you can find them cheap from new climbers who wore them to the gym for a couple trips and decided they had to wear Solutions to get better,1
7400,I may have them re-soled in slightly softer rubber st some point and use the  Mythos on hot days and the Helix for cooler days,1
7401,Anyone else think these are an unsung all arounder? Granted~ I’ve never climbed in Blancos or Pinks but I’m wondering how they compare~ (rubber aside),1
7402,a shoe is a shoe..,1
7403,the rubber is shite though.,1
7404,I use these when I don't feel like I need my Katanas (which are my favorite shoe),1
7405,I like them a lot,1
7406,Decent performance at a good price.,1
7407,Same rubber used in a dozen other shoes that run twice as much,1
7408,Edge rubber is great for its intended use,1
7409,It’s meant to be a hard wearing rubber for edging~ smeadging on granite etc,1
7410,But no~ it’s not going to be as sticky as other offerings from Vibram or C4,1
7411,Same rubber used in a dozen other shoes that run twice as much,1
7412,Edge rubber is great for its intended use,1
7413,It’s meant to be a hard wearing rubber for edging~ smeadging on granite etc,1
7414,But no~ it’s not going to be as sticky as other offerings from Vibram or C4,1
7415,I stand corrected- I had the previous version helix~ which used a budget scarpa kind of rubber that was total crap,1
7416,xs edge is great and I would totally rock these new generation shoes with xs edge.,1
7417,they are surprisingly good up to 5.11~ and comfy af~ even in winter!  i wear a size 46~ streetsize 47.5..,1
7418,does anyone know how they compare to the newish maestros ind terms of fit and sizing?,1
7419,Anyone have any experience with MR drones? I've never worn Mad Rocks and I've heard mixed reviews about them in general~ but mostly good things about the drones,1
7420,Also~ I have pretty narrow feet but nothing crazy~ is there a huge difference between the LV and the HV versions?,1
7421,One thing to take into consideration is that drones aren’t allowed in national parks....,1
7422,so....,1
7423,I tried them for a few hours in the gym,1
7424,Madrock was doing a shoe demo and I was on the hunt for new gym shoes,1
7425,They only had the HV which surprisingly fit nicely,1
7426,You don't need to size down at all,1
7427,My street size in the drone was super tight and would be the right size for me,1
7428,I felt like they had quite a bit of edging power but really lacked sensitivity,1
7429,They felt stiff and clunky to me,1
7430,So I passed on buying a pair of these even with the demo discount,1
7431,i tried the LV at a demo with my regular street shoe,1
7432,i found them to be pretty intuitive on easy boulders,1
7433,the demo promo code made them stupid cheap compared to a comparable slipper like the instinct vs but i passed on it~ not for any particular reason against the shoe especially with prices of slippers and resoles going through the roof,1
7434,I actually just bought a pair of the HV 10 minutes ago,1
7435,I tried them at a gym demo and what sold me was the fit,1
7436,When on~ my heel is just locked and has no movement at all,1
7437,They are also surprisingly comfy,1
7438,Also~ I was pretty happy with how well they smear compared to my Scarpa Helix even though they are much more aggressive of a shoe (maybe the newer rubber contributed to that),1
7439,I can't really compare to any of the other higher end shoes except for the Vapors that do seem to be a bit stiffer and sensitive,1
7440,In terms of sizing they fit pretty normally compared to a street shoe,1
7441,I typically wear anywhere from 7.5 to 8.5 and settled on a 41 EU (8 US) compared to my leather Helix (40.5 EU),1
7442,I tried the LV and HV~ I found that they're both made narrower than I expected~ I could have worn an LV~ but it was just uncomfortable~ the HV were a perfect fit,1
7443,Most girls trying them also ended up preferring the HV~ not sure if that means anything,1
7444,Price is very competitive too,1
7445,Theyre 25% off on madrock's website right now and if you find your size on campsaver or backcountry you get 5% or 14% cashback respectively in addition to the 25% Black Friday sale making them about 85-90$ US after cash back.,1
7446,Looking to buy a few new crashpads,1
7447,I’ve done a little research but want to get options of people who have them,1
7448,What’s your favorite Pad? Brand? Size?,1
7449,Organic and Asana make the best pads hands down,1
7450,They are well worth the investment~ and they keep their support longer than any other brands out there thanks to using more closed cell foam and the fabric,1
7451,another vote for organic,1
7452,i'll sell you my organic,1
7453,If you're looking for one pad to kind of do everything~ the Metolious Magnum tri-fold is a great large pad for the price,1
7454,Tri-fold design makes it more adaptable to uneven landings,1
7455,It fits in the back of my car without putting the seats down~ unlike other large pads.,1
7456,I have been eyeing the mad rock duo~ triple~ and R3,1
7457,I’ve found some good reviews about them and I’ve seen them on sale several times lately.,1
7458,The R3 is great - especially when covering uneven ground/rocks,1
7459,The only downside I can think of is that it might be easy to roll an ankle on the ribs of the pad,1
7460,I haven't rolled an ankle yet~ but it seems more likely than on a flat pad.,1
7461,If you’re planning on taking some higher falls~ the BD Mondo has my vote,1
7462,I don’t necessarily like everything about the pad (carrying system~ buckles~ and moving it quickly between nearby boulders)~ but I’ve never bottomed out on it as I have on Organic~ Metolious~ Mad Rock~ evolv~ Mammut~ and Petzl pads,1
7463,It’s pretty stiff~ but that’s why you won’t feel the dirt when you land on it,1
7464,That being said~ I think BD’s smaller pads kind of suck and would get a different brand of pad for lowballs,1
7465,For shorter falls~ the pad doesn’t really matter as much and it’s nice to have a variety in pad size and thickness for the different terrain around the problem.,1
7466,Organic is just too much money unless you can get some kind of discounts,1
7467,They do look cool,1
7468,Metolious pads can go for a pretty big discount a few times a year at REI,1
7469,Tri-fold is my only pad,1
7470,Got it for around $200,1
7471,Comes with backpack straps unlike some Organic pads,1
7472,look at https://www.sendclimbing.com/ made to last.,1
7473,I just got a new send pad,1
7474,It is now the crash pad everyone of our crew wants under them for the scary moves,1
7475,Misty Mountain Highlander,1
7476,I vote for the asana highball,1
7477,If you going to invest in a pad this one has been the most durable vs,1
7478,organic IMO,1
7479,The medium to small size pads don’t seem to have much difference (organic vs,1
7480,asana),1
7481,I ended up getting the mad rock R3~ duo~ and triple,1
7482,I only paid $480 for all 3 so it was an easy choice,1
7483,Link below if anyone else is interested.peaksgear.com/co-op,1
7484,You should check out Flashed pads,1
7485,They're made in Canada and they use a different technology than other pads,1
7486,"Description from their website: ""Flashed Air Technology (FAT) outperforms regular open cell foam in absorbing kinetic energy and providing zero bounce",1
7487,FAT cells are also extremely durable~ and last up to three times longer than open cell foam,1
7488,"It will change bouldering as we know it.""",1
7489,I'd spring for an Organic,1
7490,I've always had really amazing service from them,1
7491,I had the Robbin Flashed Air pad a while back and that thing was absolutely amazing! It never creased~ didn’t have voids from folds~ no bottoming out~ and you could fill the middle with all sorts of crap versus having stuff hanging everywhere,1
7492,If you’re willing to spend the money they’re worth it,1
7493,Plus you can tear the entire thing apart and put it in a stuff sack,1
7494,I only have one pad these days and this is the one^,1
7495,Organic hands down,1
7496,Great foam~ and customization~ Josh is the man when it comes to customer service,1
7497,If you eventually blow out the foam they'll restuff the fabric having it feel brand new,1
7498,Had nothing but great experiences purchasing from them,1
7499,End rant,1
7500,Back when I had aspirations of being decent at bouldering~ I got the Magnum at 25% off,1
7501,I didn't die when I popped off some moves down low~ and it also made an awesome mattress on road trips when I put the rear seats down,1
7502,Just got the asana superhero highball pad and that thing is mega sick,1
7503,Snap makes great pads if you're in Europe,1
7504,Not sure if they have a retailer in the US.,1
7505,Now that it has been out for a while~ I am curious to get people's takes on the 2018 version of the Reactor for ice climbing up to WI6 and mixed up to M8 (ideally with steeper angled~ T-rated picks optimized more for drytooling/mixed,1
7506,I have handled it in a store and the lower handle felt more comfortable than any other currently available tool~ but I haven't been able to climb with them,1
7507,I have been able to try out most other popular ice tools~ but not the Reactor,1
7508,I currently own Fuels (shaft a bit too wide and heavy for my liking~ handle a bit too narrow) and Ergonomics (lower grip a bit too wide and square for my liking),1
7509,From comparing it with the X-dream (which has a very similar overall geometry)~ it seems like the Reactor addresses the three most common complaints with the X-dream (handle too short for people with wider hands~ shaft not stiff enough~ picks not hard enough).,1
7510,I’ve been using a pair since around the time they came out,1
7511,A big difference I notice between it and a friend’s xdream is that they’re more head heavy,1
7512,Between that and the shaft difference you mention the swing feels fairly different; more from the shoulder and less wrist flick,1
7513,I really like them but I’ve only used it up to maybe wi5 m5 with the stock “natural ice” pick or the “alpine” pick,1
7514,Great tools in my opinion,1
7515,Of note though the bd hammer adds even more head weight which feels like a lot despite being a difference of maybe 40 grams after removing the stock head piece,1
7516,Absolutely love it for pure ice,1
7517,I go back to my fuels for anything M6 and above,1
7518,I am curious to know why you turn to the Fuels for anything M6 and above?,1
7519,Hey! I know there's already a thread on this~ but it's been a while,1
7520,I wanted to get some recommendations on a good read climbing harness,1
7521,I've tried the DMM renegade and found it was uncomfortable~ especially on the waist during hanging belays and raps,1
7522,I tried on the misty mountain Cadillac and found it way too bulky,1
7523,Just recieved an arc'teryx fl-365 and its already back in the box with a return shipping label on it,1
7524,The waist fit fine(almost too big)~ but the legs were way too tight,1
7525,I didn't find it overly comfortable either,1
7526,Would it be worth trying the ar-395 or will it fit the same,1
7527,Love my BD solution but I need bigger/ and or more gear loops,1
7528,Any suggestions? Thanks!!,1
7529,The BD Technician is pretty awesome~ I've used it for about 40pitches and its been pretty great,1
7530,The 5th rear gear loop is perfect for things like anchor building gear/gloves,1
7531,I can easily fit a double rack of C4s~ full set of nuts~ 4 alpine draws~ extra biners~ slings~ belay devices~ and more,1
7532,Pretty comfortable on hanging belays and surprisingly light weight~ legs adjust pretty well too,1
7533,In terms of pure comfort~ nothing beats the Edelrid Orion,1
7534,It's by far and away the most comfortable harness on the market if it fits you,1
7535,If you rack on your harness~ you may not love it as there are only 4 gear loops,1
7536,I don't mind it when I rack on my harness~ but I only do so for redpointing or climbs with a super light rack.,1
7537,if you're having trouble with leg fit with the arcteryx harness~ try the womens size,1
7538,a womens L is a mens M waist with a mens L leg loops,1
7539,plus the womens harness has way better colors,1
7540,the ar-395a (or 385a) is the shit.,1
7541,Find a harness that fits you,1
7542,I like my Metolus climb safe because the leg loops have a wide range of adjustment,1
7543,That’s most important for me because one leg is big and the other is much smaller...,1
7544,I´m using the arcteryx harness now,1
7545,I´m very happy with it~ gearloops are huge and i the extra loop at the back is great if you are doing multipitch stuff and need a place for the cordalette~ micro-jacket or other stuff,1
7546,I spent two days on el cap hauling a heavy pig before bailing and it was comfortable enough for that,1
7547,For regular single day stuff i find it very comfortable.,1
7548,The only climbing shop with a decent selection near me is rock and snow by the gunks~ and I've kind of expended all the options there,1
7549,That's why I kind of went out on a limb and purchased the arc'teryx online,1
7550,I checked out the technician there~ but didn't try it on because the gear loops still seemed much to small,1
7551,I tried the DMM on there and hung in it for a bit~ and it felt okay,1
7552,As soon as I took it out climbing later that day it was clear it wasn't going to work for me,1
7553,Any one have experience with the big gun? It looks large like the misty mountain~ but maybe it fits different?  Thanks again guys,1
7554,I have a Big Gun,1
7555,It's very comfortable,1
7556,If anything it has too many gear loops,1
7557,I find it to be a little like a backpack with too many pockets,1
7558,I use a Misty Mountain Sonic love it.,1
7559,Misty mountain cadillac harness all the way,1
7560,Wild country summit harness,1
7561,7 gear loops,1
7562,The loops are different sizes and not all slanted or curvy and overlapping like other 7 loop harnesses~  so you can actually use all the loops,1
7563,As comfy as any other harness I've worn,1
7564,And only like 45 bucks right now,1
7565,I got an extra so when my current one is done i will be all set,1
7566,I love my Big Gun,1
7567,Holds everything and is super comfy when hanging,1
7568,I've heard complaints that the belt is too wide~ but it fits me fine,1
7569,But then again~ I'm a big dude.,1
7570,Same~ love this harness,1
7571,Minus the rear/haul loop is too tiny...smaller biners fit~ but its not the easiest to clip.,1
7572,Why not make do with the gear loops on the comfortable harness you like and use a shoulder sling too? Lots of benefits from a shoulder sling when climbing trad,1
7573,Also I didn't notice the gear loops on my solution being all that different from a trad harness I have,1
7574,There is only so much space on a harness,1
7575,Plus if I have have a ton of weight dangling from my harness~ then the damn thing is always wanting to slide down,1
7576,I have the solution and made 2 extra gear loops out of some extra cord,1
7577,I've been really happy with the 6 loop configuration,1
7578,I put gear in the front loops,1
7579,Slings and draws on the middle ones~ and all other gear on the back loops.,1
7580,Max~ any way you can send me a pic of what you did? My best Jake,1
7581,I also have the Edelrid along with my Arcteryx,1
7582,The Edelrid is very comfy~ but i prefer the minimalistic feel of the arcteryx while climbing and don´t feel that much of a difference comfort wise,1
7583,At least i have no problem with hanging belays for a whole day,1
7584,Like others I find it to be a major con to not have an extra gearloop on the Edelrid and the haul loop is also very small~ which i find odd on a harness that seems to be geared towards trad stuff and long routes,1
7585,Other then that~ really great harness.,1
7586,I use the BD aspect and am very happy with it,1
7587,Carry my rack well and I find it comfortable,1
7588,I used to use the BD Big Gun~ which was great for hanging in~ but too bulky,1
7589,Looks lIke they replaced the aspect with the Technician.,1
7590,I've done the same thing on my BD Solution but with just a single gear loop so it looks basically like the new technician's harness rear gear loop,1
7591,I believe its a Petzl 6mm cord,1
7592,Experimented with two loops but this gave me more space and functions smoother for me since things can slide to both sides to be grabbed with either hand,1
7593,Just tied it on like I would tie a double fisherman's bend around both gear loops,1
7594,It does a decent job staying in place~ it slides around the loop when there is no gear on it and I have double clipped things to my cord loop and the molded loop accidentally before,1
7595,I've also intentionally double clipped items like a PAS to this so it is easy to locate; I did this after realizing that clipping both keeps it organized since the cord loop forces everything to sag towards the center,1
7596,I've used it for belay devices~ spare slings~ 2 double length slings~ shoes for walk off and a bail carabiner or two,1
7597,Not a perfect solution but I haven't had much of an issue with it since the only things that go on it aren't used while climbing and finding something in a strenuous stance won't be an issue,1
7598,A rubber keeper could likely be implemented to keep it from moving a little better,1
7599,The knots could also probably be improved~ they stay tight for the most part but every so often I will need to cinch them down more,1
7600,¡Be careful of sitting down at the base of a climb with a Gri Gri on this loop I've done this multiple times and it's not pleasant!,1
7601,Singing Rock Dome,1
7602,You can rack 2-3 racks,1
7603,It's big wall size~ but super comfy,1
7604,That feeling when I chose a harness for a long time and recently I bought Arcteryx,1
7605,And now I have found a lot of good reviews about this equipment here! It's nice to know that you made a good choice,1
7606,By the way~ I made a choice based on various ratings and reviews around the Internet,1
7607,So you can trust them :) For me the Arcteryx is very smartly designed to weigh a lot less but still offer loads of support and allow you to feel as comfortable as possible.,1
7608,I love my Arcteryx harness more than the average person~ but if you actually weigh one you'll realize that they're on the heavy side,1
7609,My Arcteryx weighs about 4 ounces more than my BD harness I keep for backup,1
7610,But the support and comfort is worth every ounce.,1
7611," ""But the support and comfort is worth every ounce",1
7612,""" completely agree",1
7613,Just get a bag of pretzels and talk on the internet.,1
7614,I've done the same thing on my BD Solution but with just a single gear loop so it looks basically like the new technician's harness rear gear loop..,1
7615,I've done something similar~ but with 3mm cord put through 5mm plastic tubing for easier clipping:,1
7616,I second the singing rock dome harness,1
7617,I needed more gear loops (it has 7) and for the price ($60 on sale) ai had to try it,1
7618,It has worked exceedingly well for keeping gear organized when climbing and it is comfortable and will work for big wall if you get into that one day.,1
7619,I started off with the 5.10 Guide Tennies~ which were great for climbing~ terrible for approaches,1
7620,In less than half a year the toe blew out so I picked up the Boulder X's,1
7621,They are probably the best pair of shoes I've ever owned~ of any kind~ hands down,1
7622,The first day I used them I did a 10 mile hike and at no point did I feel any discomfort,1
7623,Normally there is a break-in period for shoes but these were amazingly comfortable right out of the box~ I actually forgot I was wearing new shoes because they never bothered me,1
7624,They have great heel support (something the 5.10's didn't have) and the extra padding on the tongue makes them feel like pillows,1
7625,I accidentally slipped in a stream on a hike and expected to be squeaking and sloshing around for hours,1
7626,Not only did they dry incredibly fast but my sock and foot actually dried too which is something I've never experienced,1
7627,Usually if my foot gets wet it stays wet,1
7628,I can't recommend these shoes enough~ I would wear them everyday but I want to save the wear and tear for climbing,1
7629,They are great for aiding as well and the rubber is sticky for approaches,1
7630,11/10 will be buying another pair when these die.,1
7631,Counter point: Heavy (A pair of lightweight trail runners + climbing shoes can be lighter) Too stiff (I mean if you like aiding...) Not sticky (not even megagrip) Leather + foam soaks up water  HUGE on a harness,1
7632,I know there are some people who like old clunky shoes~ which these are great for,1
7633,But in this day and age most people are better off in TX3's or TX4's,1
7634,I use these mostly for aiding~ I avoided the lighter shoes because I don't know if they can handle the abuse,1
7635,The shoes don't feel clunky to me~ no heavier than the 5.10's and they don't feel stiff either~ but the 5.10's felt stiff to me.,1
7636,Too bad LaSpo discontinued the Ganda..,1
7637,I don't aid~ but can second the TX3 for short approaches~ up to 5.easy,1
7638,I mostly just wear my Helios 2.0 for places like Eldo or Lumpy,1
7639,They are super light and have a clip in loop,1
7640,If I have a heavy pack~ and need to negotiate talus~ these days real hiking boots with a heel welt are so light~ you might as well wear them as approach shoes,1
7641,and bring a pair of sneakers for the descent.,1
7642,Echo the point that they're great for aiding or long days with a lot of weight,1
7643,Love mine for those uses~ much better than the tennies,1
7644,If I'm free climbing and moving quicker with the shoes on the back of my harness~ the TX2 is hard to beat,1
7645,Different tools for different applications.,1
7646,I've heard alot of reviews where people say that these shoes fit perfectly right out of the box,1
7647,Personally~ I tried on various sizes of the Boulder X and it just didn't fit me right,1
7648,Tried different sock and size combinations and they ended up giving me blisters on both heels,1
7649,I use them basically as a beefy hiking shoe that can carry weight is actually good on 4th and 5.easy (though not the best),1
7650,They are awesome with micro-spikes or strap crampons,1
7651,They are great in ladders,1
7652,They are pretty waterproof with the high rand as long as you aren't trudging through a river,1
7653,In heavy NC summer storms~ my feet are ususally the only thing that isn't drenched.,1
7654,I love my boulder x shoes I’m on my third pair and that’s not saying they wear out fast My favorite all times are the Guides Made in Italy I also have two pairs of Wildcats a new pair of Nucleos and just picked up a pair of slightly used Mythos Might say I’m a LaSportiva fan,1
7655,And the Mix,1
7656,Best shoe I've ever worn.,1
7657,I debated and read multiple reviews about the Boulder X,1
7658," After wearing the Scarpa Crux canvas since about 2013 (and still using them as my ""gym beaters"" to do backpack laps/train)~ I settled for replacing my approach shoes with the La Sportiva TX3 vs the Boulder X",1
7659,As others have mentioned the breathability of the Boulder X is a limitation that comes with the durability of its leather upper,1
7660,Climbing wise~ I can't compare the Boulder X head to head with the TX3 but I will say that I don't love the way the TX3 feels when climbing,1
7661," The ""climbing zone"" compared to my old Scarpa Crux is too limited",1
7662,The TX3 feels great hiking and scrambling,1
7663,The way I sweat and since I primarily climb in the southeastern US~ I had to favor a canvas/synthetic upper,1
7664,Others have mentioned the weight of the Boulder X as an issue~ and that may be a legit concern too,1
7665," Think about the quote from Bill Bowerman in Without Limits~ ""(assuming a good miler has a 2 yard stride)...take an ounce off the shoe~ that's 55 pounds of weight you don't have to carry."" All that to say~ very glad it seems the Boulder X is the shoe for you~ just wanted to add some thoughts for anyone that might be debating purchasing a pair",1
7666,I know I debated pretty hard about getting them...and if I didn't have such sweaty feet/live in a hot/humid climate~ I would have leaned toward the Boulder X too.,1
7667,And the Mix,1
7668,Best shoe I've ever worn,1
7669,I'd bet you can still get the Mix from an EU reseller,1
7670,I really like my TX4's (leather tx3's),1
7671," For my foot fit was the biggest difference between the TX4 and Boulder X...Also underfoot the X's felt ""vague"" ",1
7672,FYI on the long term durability for the Boulder Xs,1
7673,I blew the toes of mine after two bigwalls,1
7674,The next day I talked to a guy who had the same problem after only one~ two weeks after he bought the shoes,1
7675,They've been good approach shoes but bigwall shoes they are not,1
7676,The toe rubber is very thin,1
7677,What do you recommend for big wall?  I blew out my toe also and had to get a fresh pair two days before my first wall,1
7678,They held up but I'm looking at other options.,1
7679,I have never done a big wall....but I used to aid climb a lot,1
7680,I used a pair of 5.10 Guide high tops that worked very well~ protected my ankles~ but were svelte enough to fit into the step of my aiders well,1
7681,Love my Boulder Xs,1
7682,The benefits outweigh the negatives imo,1
7683,They climb great(Onsighted 5.10 with them) for easier routes and are great for hiking,1
7684,Durability is the strongest benefit for me~ with that comes the added weight,1
7685,Tradeoffs.,1
7686,Sort of related to the forum topic,1
7687,I had a North Face Tadpole tent that I loaned to friends~ and it came back to me after a month,1
7688,It had been put away damp/wet and sat for long enough that the fly mildewed and basically became useless at keeping moisture off the tent,1
7689,After my Whitney trip~ I tossed the fly before flying home,1
7690,I called North Face to buy a replacement fly~ but they no longer have any,1
7691,So now I have a perfectly good tent with no fly - gggrrr! The North Face rep said to return the tent and they might do something about a credit towards a new one (even though the tent itself isn’t damaged) Anyway~ took it to the local North Face store~ they sent it back~ confirming email from TNF,1
7692,A week later~ I get an email with FULL credit for the original price of the tent! Outstanding! Just thought I should share,1
7693,Great warranty and custom service from North Face,1
7694,Cheers Barry,1
7695,Sigh,1
7696,So close but..,1
7697,"  I've been on the search for what seems like forever for a ""less pointy Miura""",1
7698,BITD~ Miuras were my go-to for harder granite cragging,1
7699,I didn't fit them tightly and as most know~ Miuras end up with a nice~ nearly flat profile after some breaking in,1
7700,The trend towards all this radical downturned~ slingshot rand tension BS has not been in my foots favor,1
7701,Unfortunately~ the Miura toe box is a wee bit too pointy for my wide toe / narrow heel feet,1
7702,TC Pros have been damn near perfect for most things and although they can squeeze a bit on the outer side after a long bit of time they're pretty close,1
7703,I still want a low top shoe for those long~ techy granite face climbing days though,1
7704,The Scarpa Maestro LOW was ordered,1
7705,45.5 (I wear a TC Pro in 44 performance fit and 44.5 all day fit,1
7706,44 Miuras BITD,1
7707,Scarpa Helix 44.5 ) This shoe fit quite well AND felt great but then the ankle/heel area,1
7708,Fail,1
7709,There's too much material there and it develops weird folds when on my foot near the ankle bone,1
7710,Lots of heel farting as well,1
7711,It's as if they used a down turned last not thinking most of the time the foot would be flexed upwards or flat,1
7712,Compare to the Helix in the images,1
7713,If SCARPA could get the Helix fit in the Maesto low I think they'd have a winner.,1
7714,The scarpa vapor lace may be a good alternative,1
7715,I have a similar foot shape (narrow heel~ wider toes) and wear the instinct VSR~ and I’ve met a few instinct wearers who also love the fit of the vapor lace,1
7716,They’re also not too pricey,1
7717,yeah try the Vapor lace,1
7718,It's less pointy than the Miura~ flat~ and very versatile,1
7719,It performs well but is still very comfortable for the amount of performance,1
7720,It can edge well~ smear way better than a super downturned shoe~ and it holds its own in cracks,1
7721,Not the same as a TC Pro in cracks but it holds up to some jamming,1
7722,I like it as a face climbing shoe for granite,1
7723,I've been using it along with my TC Pros as a 2 shoe quiver for granite,1
7724,Thanks guys,1
7725,These were off my radar for some reason but look to be exactly what I’m looking for,1
7726,I have a 45.5 inbound now,1
7727,Will report back,1
7728,Cheers,1
7729,I used to swear by my vapor lace on everything but have slowly transitioned over to the boostic on hard granite face climbing and a large boostic for crack climbing,1
7730,I have not tried it on slab but I use a pair of old instinct slippers for slab,1
7731,Look at the boostic it is not that miuch more aggressive than the vapor and edges like no other shoe I have climbed in.,1
7732,I had a similar experience with the Maestro Low,1
7733,For me the width was great but my toes too curled up and pushing uncomfortably against the rubber in my regular Scarpa size but if I sized up I ended up with too much flex in the toes and a very baggy heel,1
7734,It's a shame because as you said the shoe is so close~ it just has such an odd fit,1
7735,I had used the Vapor Lace a while ago and found it was great initially but quickly became too soft and loose,1
7736,I'm sticking with the TC Pro and Katana Lace.,1
7737,You all might want to see consider the 5.10 Quantum Lace~ 1/2 down from street size,1
7738,I have the same wide duck feet narrow heel and it's a great match,1
7739,The Miura was my go to shoe for everything until Black Diamond got into the game,1
7740,The Aspect is now my favorite shoe! Street shoe size for all day comfort~ 1/2 size down for single pitch hard granite cragging,1
7741,I still love my Miuras for  limestone and  dolomite pockets ~ but for cracks ~ slabs and edging the Aspects are the $%#t!!,1
7742,Don't the boostics knuckle your big toe up fairly aggressively? I've only tried on the booster S~ but I thought the last was similar,1
7743,Don't the boostics knuckle your big toe up fairly aggressively? I've only tried on the booster S~ but I thought the last was similar,1
7744,I'm not mike but I have a looser-fit pair of Boostics and yes the shape of the shoe somehow forces my big toe to knuckle,1
7745,Painful in cracks for me.,1
7746,hmm I dont get that knuckling that you talk about,1
7747,Mine are super comfortable on my feet and I could leave them on for extended periods if I needed to.,1
7748,Do you have a significant mortons toe?,1
7749,I have no morton's toe at all,1
7750,But like I mentioned I dont do a ton of crack climbing in them but they are great on steep granite edging (any rock type for that matter),1
7751,I ended up with a pair of Maestro's myself after trying on 14 pairs of shoes in Keswick last month,1
7752,My previous shoes were the Scarpa Helix~ just like you~ and I found them incredibly comfy,1
7753,The Maestro's were the best by far of everything I tried though,1
7754,I don't tend to knuckle my toes and hence have a slightly larger fit but I did get them so they were slightly tight on my toe (I have one foot larger than the other by about a half size~ the larger one fitted tight but not painful - I could wear and walk around the shop without problem,1
7755,The other~ smaller~ foot was quite tight and I had to remove it after about 3 or 4 minutes,1
7756,However~ once I got them home and kept wearing them for a while~ I did get a little stretch but not quite enough,1
7757,Then I bought some shoes stretchers and managed to make space for my big toe,1
7758,Now I can wear them for most of a session~ taking them off for a few minutes here and there when I have a rest or belay (I don't have to do this but it certainly feels nice!),1
7759,The only slack I have in the Maestro is above the toes~ which I presume is the space provided for people who want to knuckle their toes,1
7760,My feet are quite narrow~ long and completely flat and a prominent big toe,1
7761,I have to say I love the Maestro's now although they do fart occasionally (I take this to mean they are fitting particularly well most of the time?),1
7762,Farts mean dead space~ it's not a good fit,1
7763,I've since bought a second pair of mid's to complement them as I loved them so much,1
7764,The farting stopped after a while (as the shoe conformed to my feet),1
7765,The mids also didn't have as much space above the toe so they fit even better,1
7766,Very~ very happy with them and the second pair fit slightly better once new (or my feet are less sensitive now),1
7767,Any opinions on the absolute best ultralight tents and sleeping bags? I want to be able to pack a fairly small bag for overnights in southeast Alaskan alpine,1
7768,I've been looking at ZPacks~ and their stuff appears to be both light and like it could stand up to rain and wind,1
7769,Any experience with this brand? Or thoughts on others? Thanks very much!,1
7770,Have you used an ultra option before? What sort of Alaskan alpine are we talking? I personally would go with something like the BD firstlight or the MSR equivalent for anything that involve high winds and/or snow,1
7771,I stayed with a buddy in his hyperlite~ while the first night we had good weather~ the second night we had pretty high winds and snow/sleet mix,1
7772,I ended up walking 13 miles in the middle of the night to the car because there was no way we were sleeping or keeping anything dry,1
7773,I can see the positives in them~ but only in the right conditions.,1
7774,Zpacks are relatively fragile shelters best used in protected tentsites on the Appalachian trail~ which is their intended market,1
7775,"The construction quality is ""meh.""  A good pyramid shelter is probably the best ultralight option for bad weather~ but it's not a bombshelter like a good mountaineering tent",1
7776,Hyperlite and Locus are the best brands IMO,1
7777,The best sleeping bags are made by Nunatak~ Western Mountaineering and Feathered Friends,1
7778,I’m talking Tongass National Rainforest and the emerald green alpine above it,1
7779,More rain than snow,1
7780,Definitely the possibility for high winds and some snow up above tree line,1
7781,It’s likely that my trips will be somewhat weather dependent~ but this environment is commonly pervasively windy and wet,1
7782,Though it is markedly less wet in our current climate,1
7783,I don’t need something for driving snow~ though am looking for something that can handle rain and wind,1
7784,In those conditions I'd much prefer a TarpTent over the Zpacks tents if you're still looking for lightweight,1
7785,I have the TarpTent Rainbow and have been happy with it.,1
7786,The Duplex is rad,1
7787,I probably have 40+ nights (half above treeline) in CO with mine including some super strong winds and  it's in perfect shape,1
7788,I've stayed perfectly dry in a couple of heinous downpours and it also has the best waterproof bathtub floor in in the market~ regardless of weight,1
7789,The only negative is the metal clip to close the fly is a bit fiddly with one hand in the middle of the night,1
7790,I also have a 30F Zpacks sleeping bag and 2 of their packs,1
7791,The packs are amazing and the bag is high quality but it turns out~ I prefer a sleeping bag with the mummy hood,1
7792,Thanks Jesse,1
7793,The Duplex is really highly rated for being ultralight and really waterproof—I’m very attracted to it,1
7794,I wouldn't rely on 0.51oz/yd DCF in any serious storms~ especially if hail is possible or your safety is relying on it.,1
7795,I’m talking Tongass National Rainforest and the emerald green alpine above it,1
7796,More rain than snow,1
7797,Definitely the possibility for high winds and some snow up above tree line,1
7798,It’s likely that my trips will be somewhat weather dependent~ but this environment is commonly pervasively windy and wet,1
7799,Though it is markedly less wet in our current climate,1
7800,I don’t need something for driving snow~ though am looking for something that can handle rain and wind,1
7801,What’s the reason for the ultralight?,1
7802,What’s the reason for the ultralight? I guess mostly cuz I'm fat and lazy,1
7803,I'd like to have a really minimal~ light pack for getting up into the alpine~ or back to the lakes and such,1
7804,I don't want to carry a big bag~ so I'm trying to find stuff that can pack down small and light while still being functional,1
7805,It's unlikely I'm going to choose to do an overnight if the weather is really gnarly~ though weather comes up quick and changes even quicker,1
7806,Or at least it used to,1
7807,It's all sunshine and butterflies in southeast these days,1
7808,Only blows 40 or 50~ nothing like it used to do,1
7809,It's never that cold here~ but it is wet and cool,1
7810,It's currently blowing pretty robust and raining sideways,1
7811,A pleasant Fall day.,1
7812,Any suggestions for sturdier tents for wind and rain that still pack light and small?,1
7813,Sil nylon pyramid,1
7814,DCF doesn't pack small,1
7815,MLD pyramid tents in Silnylon MLD~ nunatak~ or katabatic for quilts,1
7816,Does anyone know who sells large red duffle bags like one in the photo,1
7817,Some people use Google or Amazon to find things.,1
7818,It's likely that bag was made specifically for that photoshoot,1
7819,It has no visible logo or brand name~ which is important in promotional picture props,1
7820,The bag itself actually looks very low quality,1
7821,If you need a red expedition-size duffel~ there are lots of options out there,1
7822,If you specifically want a flimsy~ cheap~ large one-pocket duffel that is red~ perhaps a firefighter duffel such as this one would work:,1
7823,Thank you for your replies.,1
7824,I own a duffel bag that looks much like that one,1
7825,I also have a blue one!  It's good quality~ made of canvas and has held up well,1
7826,It's been to a few places around the world,1
7827,It's probably traveled 50K miles,1
7828,It's like an old friend,1
7829,I bought it from Campmor~ about 25 years ago~ before online shopping,1
7830,(Do they still print that catalog on newspaper material? I haven't received one in years...) I think the duffel was their own brand but it doesn't have any label,1
7831,I checked the Campmor website and it appears they don't have them any more~ but there are some other selections,1
7832,Of course there's probably a zillion choices on Amazon.,1
7833,North Face makes giant duffels~ model is Base Camp,1
7834,They are the close to indestructible,1
7835,I've had one for 14 years~ it's been dragged around the world~ literally dragged~ over rock and ice~ and besides some cosmetic wear~ thing is still water tight and solid,1
7836,I don't believe that what you're looking at is a duffle bag,1
7837,I believe it's the cover for a sled,1
7838,Kifaru~ formally a branch of Mountainsmith use to to make sleds,1
7839,Not sure anymore~ you could do a search,1
7840,Wild Things use to make a large duffle one could haul,1
7841,"Another search option would be ""pulk""which I believe is Norwegian for sled.",1
7842,I have tnf basecamp duffles~ Patagonia black hole duffles ( lighter) and a huge Gregory duffle made from a vinyl coated nylon,1
7843,All work really well and are pretty bomb proof,1
7844,The Gregory one is the most simple~ looks a lot like the one in the photo,1
7845,It looks like a generic big duffel that is sitting on a sled,1
7846,The pull handle and undone straps are all part of the sled,1
7847,There is one loop at the end of the zipper which is clipped to the sled,1
7848,If you want something just like it~ you are probably going to have a hard time finding something without carrying handles.,1
7849,It's an Aguille Alpine Expedition Pulk Bag.,1
7850,I just got back from a week in Indian Creek with the La Sportiva Kataki~ and here are a few initial thoughts,1
7851,The Sportiva Kataki is the lace version of the Otaki and the sister shoe to the softer Skwama,1
7852,I have worn out a pair of both the Otakis and the Skwamas~ and I'll compare the Kataki to both of those,1
7853,The Kataki fits like the Otaki and Skwama: wide at the forefoot,1
7854,But the laces extend down to near the toe~ allowing a more precise fit,1
7855,The toe is low profile and similar to the Otaki,1
7856,The Skwama's toe is a bit higher profile and less supple with all the rubber up front,1
7857,I climbed cracks from fist size down to 5.12 .3-.4 Camalots in the Kataki,1
7858,I also used them to climb Stolen Chimney~ and I used them for an afternoon of sport climbing at Wall Street,1
7859,From 5.10 hands to 5.12 fingers to 5.12 edgy face routes~ they performed great,1
7860,The laces do show some fuzzy wear after several days of jamming in cracks,1
7861,I imagine if I was there for much longer~ the laces would need to be replaced,1
7862,They are much stiffer than the Skwama,1
7863,The Skwama is not only softer in flex~ its XS Grip seems to wear out nearly twice as fast as XS Edge,1
7864,The benefit of XS Grip is that I think it holds much better on rounded crappy feet frequently encountered while bouldering,1
7865,The Skwama is definitely better for bouldering and gym climbing for me than the Otaki/Kataki,1
7866,The more custom fit of the Kataki over the Otaki due to the laces make the Kataki my choice for roped climbing,1
7867,"Some folks may poo on the idea of using an ""aggressive"" shoe like the Kataki for crack climbing",1
7868,But other folks recognize that shoes like the Katana Lace and Kataki can be great for cracks---especially thin cracks,1
7869,Anyway~ that's about it at this point,1
7870,I need to wear them more to have more thoughts on their performance on other terrain,1
7871,My prior experience with the Otaki and Skwama informs some of what I think I'll find,1
7872,For example~ I think the S-heel is a gimmick and doesn't do much~ if anything~ for me,1
7873,I'm really liking this new line from Sportiva.,1
7874,Thanks for the review!  So if the S-heel is gimmicky~ what is it you like about the line?  It sounds like the Kataki is otherwise basically a Katana Lace.,1
7875,Thanks~ I've been meaning to try on a pair,1
7876,How does it compare to the Katana Lace in stiffness? I know the toe box is more asymmetric like the Otaki...,1
7877,It is very similar in performance to a Katana Lace,1
7878,"Thus the ""Kataki: Katana+Otaki"" name",1
7879,The fit is different,1
7880,I couldn't wear a Katana Lace~ but the Kataki fits my foot extremely well,1
7881,It is similar to a typical Scarpa fit~ but with a slightly larger (less precise for some?) heel,1
7882,Fit is everything when it comes to shoes,1
7883,I'm hesitant to endorse how well any shoe fits as different folks' feet are so different,1
7884,It may be slightly softer than a Katana Lace~ but to be honest I haven't worn a Katana Lace enough to say that's the case,1
7885,I'm hoping it won't be too much softer than Katana Lace..,1
7886,The Otaki fits my feet better~ so I'm hoping that'll extend to the Kataki,1
7887,"As for the ""typical"" Scarpa fit~ I'm not should there is such a thing",1
7888,IMO~ the Vapors (more asymmetric like the Otaki~ but narrower and aren't as stiff) fit differently from the Instincts (even between the VS and the current lace~ with the lace having a tighter (narrower & lower profile) toe box in practice) and from the Boost(er/ic)/Dargo/Furia,1
7889,Not to mention the fit difference between iterations.,1
7890,They fit very much like an Otaki and are similar in stiffness,1
7891,I have worn out two pairs of Instinct VS~ each with multiple resoles~ and they were my prior favorite shoe before this new line from Sportiva,1
7892,I got a pair of the new Instinct Lace in the mail when I got home~ but I haven't tried them yet,1
7893,"Out of the box the new Instinct Lace felt like my toe was really ""up front"" in the toe box",1
7894,Hard to describe~ but it seemed a bit weird at my toes---as if my big toe was right over (almost beyond) the front edge of the sole~ and I could easily stub my big toe if I wasn't careful,1
7895,"Is ""too precise"" a thing? I appreciate the feedback on Scarpa shoes",1
7896,My only real experience with them has been the Instinct VS~ Feroce~ and some Generators from way back when,1
7897,You can see a tiny little bulge at the end of the toe of the Instinct Lace where my toe pushes the thin rand out,1
7898,Did you size the Kataki the same size as your Otaki and Skwama?,1
7899,I went one half size bigger than my old Otaki and Skwama in order for my toes to lie flatter for cracks and longer comfort,1
7900,My foot measures 10.5~ but I usually wear 11.5 in most street shoes due to width issues,1
7901,I've owned 2 pairs of Otaki at 43~ one pair of Skwamas at 43~ a current Skwama at 43.5 and the Kataki at 43.5.,1
7902,Awesome! Thanks for the review,1
7903,I currently love my pair of Otakis and was eyeing the Katakis when I have to send these in for a resole,1
7904,Or I was debating just getting another pair of Otakis,1
7905,Being able to lace up tight to dial in the fit seems nice,1
7906,Hi Brian~ I just won the Kataki in a prize draw and I'm wondering how to size them since I can't test the shoe before buying them since it's getting shipped to me,1
7907,I am between 12.5-13 US street shoe size and I'm thinking of getting a 45.5 shoe,1
7908,What do you think? I also have wide feet and morton's foot~ so I think our fit should be similar,1
7909,Also~ do you recommend this shoe for gym climbing or should I save it for outdoor stuff? Thanks,1
7910,I would go try on some Sportivas in the store and figure out what size you like,1
7911,I wear an 11.5 street shoe usually,1
7912,43 is a single pitch fit and 43.5 is a multipitch and crack fit,1
7913,I found the Skwama and Otaki to fit differently from many other LS shoes,1
7914,I wear a 43 in Katana Lace~ Miura VS~ TC Pro~ and Testarossa~ but a 43 in the Skwama or Otaki is unusably sloppy,1
7915,I bought Skwamas in 42 and have been happy with that,1
7916,I don't own the Otaki but I've tried it on a couple of times and would also get it in 42,1
7917,(I wear a 10.5-11 street shoe~ not that that means much.) Edit: I tried on a Kataki in 42 today,1
7918,It fits just like the Otaki,1
7919,It feels a bit softer overall than the Katana Lace but is otherwise shaped and constructed very similarly.,1
7920,Anyone want to venture a comparison to the Miura lace up? Those the most precise shoe I've ever worn and I love them for vertical climbing,1
7921,Unfortunately they're a little too narrow for me to use out of the box and take a long time to break in to anything near comfortable.,1
7922,I've got a 41 in the skwama and Otaki and a 42 in the katana lace,1
7923,Been eyeing these as I love laces,1
7924,Feels like a 41.5 may be the ticket for me!,1
7925,I have all of the shoes mentioned in the La Sportiva line up,1
7926,I am not sure why~ (perhaps there were different sizing generations) but I have found that my Otakis are much more precise and have a harder edge than my skwama of the same size,1
7927,I’ve taken to using my otaki for harder short routes and the Kataki for longer climbs,1
7928,I was also once Miura Guy~ I still love em,1
7929,Still trying to figure out how I feel about the Miura XX.,1
7930,Anyone want to venture a comparison to the Miura lace up? Those the most precise shoe I've ever worn and I love them for vertical climbing,1
7931,Unfortunately they're a little too narrow for me to use out of the box and take a long time to break in to anything near comfortable,1
7932,I wear Miura Lace 39 and it's slightly tight even after 1 year,1
7933,I recently bought Otaki size 39.5 and it's really comfortable after few climbing sessions,1
7934,I think I should have gone with 39~ but 39.5 comfortable enough,1
7935,For reference~ my running shoes is size 42 or 8.5 2E (Asics),1
7936,I had climbed in Otakis for the last year or so and LOVE them,1
7937,I have had them resoled a few times and the leather on top is now stretched and I have to crank down on the velcro which is causing some pain~ or else they feel too loose,1
7938,I was looking to buy new shoes to replace them and was considering the Kataki - I have TC Pros and had Taratulaces~ and think lace-ups for my more aggressive shoes might be a good idea,1
7939,I have read the posts above and it seems that I should maybe get the Katakis in the same size as my Otakis (44),1
7940,However~ this website says the Katakis are NOT just lace-up Otakis and size quite differently,1
7941,Furthermore~ this website predicts I should get a 44.5 in Katakis,1
7942,First question - are Otakis and Katakis really that similar~ or are they truly different shoes? Second question - if I get Katakis~ what size? THANKS!!!,1
7943,Splitterchoss is wrong~ the Kataki very much is a lace-up Otaki,1
7944,Sizing is exactly the same.,1
7945,yep,1
7946,I wear the same size in both,1
7947,Not me~ kataki a 1/2 up,1
7948,Hey all~ looking to add to the quiver while some shoes are out for a resole,1
7949,My current go to is a katana lace in 42.5 (slight curl in big toe but overall comfortable),1
7950,Thinking of the Otaki or Skwama (but was leaning towars the skwama since it seems like the Otaki is pretty similar to the Katana Lace in performance),1
7951,I’m wanting something easy on/off for bouldering and sport climbing,1
7952,I like snug but not painful fit...size down in Skwama to 42 for stretch? Thoughts from those that have used both?,1
7953,I love my Otakis!  I just got my second pair~ after considering other options,1
7954,After 1.5 years and three re-soles~ the leather has stretched and the downturn has flattened,1
7955,I tried Scarp Vapors but they didn't feel right,1
7956,I ended up not getting the Katakis exactly because I didn't want to have to deal with laces if I am taking them on/off a lot at gym,1
7957,Please note though that I have a wide foot and things like Miuras feel terrible~ even at street shoes size~ while I wear my Otakis very small,1
7958,Street shoes is something like a 46~ but I wear Otakis in 44,1
7959,I have the Katana Lace in 43.5 and the kataki's in 43,1
7960,kataki's aren't any wider than the Katana lace~ I sized down because I thought they were wider,1
7961,"The toes are so tight but there's about 1/4"" of dead space around the heel~ so the back of my foot slides around on heel hooks and smears~  also fart noises",1
7962,They're not as stiff as the Katanas but they came with much thicker souls,1
7963,They almost seemed like 5mm.,1
7964,And the last downside is that they turn your feet blue,1
7965,But they edge great~  smear OK~  crack well and the rubber is nice and thick,1
7966," Hey Josh~ what foot shape do you have? I'm getting conflicting information but with a medium volume forefoot and low volume heel I was going to go up a full size from my Katana Lace (42.5) to a 43.5 in the Kataki for a ""comfort/all around fit""",1
7967,Thanks for the reply reboot,1
7968,Were you going for a curled toe or or flat toe fit?,1
7969,Great~ thanks again.,1
7970,I bought the same size (41) in both Katana LU and the Kataki (women’s version),1
7971,They fit very differently on my feet,1
7972,Katana has no dead space in the toes,1
7973,Great for edging~ but can’t smear,1
7974,The Kataki has a little more space in the toes,1
7975,More comfortable,1
7976,Smears great,1
7977,I didn’t like the XS Grip 2 on the women’s version of the Kataki though,1
7978,If I had to do it again~ i’d probably go down a 1/2 size in the Kataki,1
7979,For reference I wear an 8.5 Converse.,1
7980,Thanks~ Chris,1
7981,I ended up ordering both a 43 and 43.5 (half size up),1
7982,I'm wanting this to kinda be my all around shoe and after a full day usually my feet are aching in my Katanas,1
7983,Hoping the extra toe space with the Kataki solves this issue,1
7984,Cheers.,1
7985,That's exactly why I originally decided not to size down on my Katakis,1
7986,My Katanas were the perfect performance fit~ and I wanted a more comfortable multi-route shoe,1
7987,I definitely got that with the Katakis,1
7988,Just be aware that they do stretch quite a lot,1
7989,Good luck!,1
7990,Yer all gone die,1
7991,-Tony,1
7992,Is that really your name?,1
7993,Is that really your name? Totally,1
7994,So for the climber who doesn’t fit into a Miura VS~ what’s the best edging shoe from Sportiva,1
7995,I’ve worn 3-4pairs of Katanas and K Laces~ are Katakis or Otakis going to cut it on heinous vert edging?,1
7996,Single pitch or multi?  The TC Pros are the only other LS shoe that fits my feet (I got half size bigger than Otakis),1
7997,Obviously these are mostly used for all day multi-pitch~ vert/crack/etc~ but I find the stiffness and edging quite good for smaller footholds that require balance~ even in the gym,1
7998,I like the Katana Lace over Kataki for edging~ they’re a little stiffer.,1
7999,The Kataki is a Katana Lace with a wider toe box and S heel,1
8000,Also is the best all-around shoe in the game,1
8001,Size 1/2 up for all-day trad,1
8002,Great for sport too except for cave/huge overhangs,1
8003,Stretches a little~ so cram it home for sport sizing,1
8004,The Kataki is not a KL,1
8005,The Kataki is built on a different last~ the shoe is more asymmetrical and slightly more down turned,1
8006,The KL is also a stiffer shoe from experience as well,1
8007,They fit very much like an Otaki and are similar in stiffness,1
8008,I have worn out two pairs of Instinct VS~ each with multiple resoles~ and they were my prior favorite shoe before this new line from Sportiva,1
8009,I got a pair of the new Instinct Lace in the mail when I got home~ but I haven't tried them yet,1
8010,"Out of the box the new Instinct Lace felt like my toe was really ""up front"" in the toe box",1
8011,Hard to describe~ but it seemed a bit weird at my toes---as if my big toe was right over (almost beyond) the front edge of the sole~ and I could easily stub my big toe if I wasn't careful,1
8012,"Is ""too precise"" a thing? I appreciate the feedback on Scarpa shoes",1
8013,My only real experience with them has been the Instinct VS~ Feroce~ and some Generators from way back when How do you size the instinct lace relative to the kataki/otaki?,1
8014,I wear a 44 in Instinct Lace~ so 0.5-1 size up from Sportiva,1
8015,How do these shoes perform compared to the Katana Lace's and Miura VS? I'm looking for a she that excels at precise footwork and can stick on a micro edge or smear well when needed,1
8016,Overhangs are not a concern...I climb some steep stuff but nothing crazy,1
8017,Boreal Linx for better smearing and very good edging,1
8018,They seem a tad stiff and more precise to my foot that the katana lace.,1
8019,Just to add a couple more data points~ I have been climbing in TC Pros (44.5) for cracks mostly in Squamish and Shamans (12) mostly for the bouldering gym but also for the occasional real face climb,1
8020,I blew out the toe on my TC Pro trying to stick a smear on a single crystal and my Shamans are nearly worn through the toe too so I figured I'd try something a little different and picked up a pair of Skwamas (44) and a pair of Katakis (44.5),1
8021,The Skwamas are a good replacement for the Shamans and fit nearly the same but are not nearly as comfortable,1
8022,I've had the Shamans for so long that maybe I don't remember how they felt when they were new,1
8023,The Skwamas have a terribly sharp edge on the plastic material under both ankle bones,1
8024,I actually took a nail file to the shoe to smooth the sharp edge out and it helped,1
8025,I can't believe a $170 shoe would have such an unfinished detail,1
8026,Other than the pain in the ankle I really like the way the shoe climbs both in the gym an on real granite,1
8027,It's softer both under and over the toes than the Shaman which gives it a little more sensitivity but somehow feel like it edges better too,1
8028,That might be due to the broken midsole in my Shamans,1
8029,The heel fits well (other than the sharp edge) and stays secure during heel hooks,1
8030,Overall the Skwamas are a good addition and I think they will get better as they break in,1
8031,I have less days in the Katakis so far~ just a couple of pitches outside and a session in the gym,1
8032,Initially they felt too tight~ I was hoping to fit them for finger cracks~ my thinking was that the lower profile toe box might fit better in less-than-hand cracks than the toe on the TC Pros,1
8033,Both the TC Pros and the Katakis in a 44.5 leave me with a flat big toe and the rest of my toes are curled,1
8034,With the wider toe in the TC Pro my toes aren't as curled as they are in the narrower toe of the Kataki,1
8035,As they break in I'm starting to feel more optimistic that I got the sizing right,1
8036,My gym session in them gave me the impression that they had all the feel of a wooden clog under the big toe which is a stark contrast to the Skwama but I could stand on the big toe well even with less compression,1
8037,My one day climbing outside in them (just a few pitches after teaching some belay skills) left me thinking that I sized them right and that they will work for what I want,1
8038,They are not a direct replacement for the TC Pro but I think they will perform better in the smaller cracks,1
8039,I'll have to get some more mileage on them to know if they'll stretch as much as the TC Pros did,1
8040,If they do then they will be great crack shoes~ if they don't then they'll be good for finger cracks only and not so good for hand cracks where my other toes will get smashed knuckles,1
8041,Time will tell,1
8042,Someone with narrower feet or different toe shape than mine would have a very different experience comparing the TC Pro and the Kataki for crack climbing.,1
8043,The Skwama fits very differently for me; can’t wear it,1
8044,The Otaki a little differently and I probably need a half size larger,1
8045,The Kataki is a great face climbing shoe~ a little like the Miura lace but not as precise in the toe,1
8046,However they fit me better and I really like them.,1
8047,The Otaki feels like a larger volume Miura VS with a less aggressive shape (just as downturned~ but less asymmetrical),1
8048,Baggier heel (for me).,1
8049,I have the womens skawama in 40,1
8050,I just got a pair of women’s Katakis in 41,1
8051,I got the women’s because I wanted the grip rubber instead of the edge due to the fact I’m a only 136 lbs,1
8052,there super comfy but I do regret not getting a 40.5,1
8053,The toe flexes a bit on small holds,1
8054,I’m thinking about sending them back but I’m not sure what that half size will really benfit enough for the trouble,1
8055,I wear a 42 street shoe.,1
8056,Same size street shoe~ 40 skwama was a snug performance fit on me~ 39.5 was damn near plastic bag required when new.,1
8057,I just got back from a week in Indian Creek with the La Sportiva Kataki~ and here are a few initial thoughts,1
8058,The Sportiva Kataki is the lace version of the Otaki and the sister shoe to the softer Skwama,1
8059,I have worn out a pair of both the Otakis and the Skwamas~ and I'll compare the Kataki to both of those,1
8060,The Kataki fits like the Otaki and Skwama: wide at the forefoot,1
8061,But the laces extend down to near the toe~ allowing a more precise fit,1
8062,The toe is low profile and similar to the Otaki,1
8063,The Skwama's toe is a bit higher profile and less supple with all the rubber up front,1
8064,I climbed cracks from fist size down to 5.12 .3-.4 Camalots in the Kataki,1
8065,I also used them to climb Stolen Chimney~ and I used them for an afternoon of sport climbing at Wall Street,1
8066,From 5.10 hands to 5.12 fingers to 5.12 edgy face routes~ they performed great,1
8067,The laces do show some fuzzy wear after several days of jamming in cracks,1
8068,I imagine if I was there for much longer~ the laces would need to be replaced,1
8069,They are much stiffer than the Skwama,1
8070,The Skwama is not only softer in flex~ its XS Grip seems to wear out nearly twice as fast as XS Edge,1
8071,The benefit of XS Grip is that I think it holds much better on rounded crappy feet frequently encountered while bouldering,1
8072,The Skwama is definitely better for bouldering and gym climbing for me than the Otaki/Kataki,1
8073,The more custom fit of the Kataki over the Otaki due to the laces make the Kataki my choice for roped climbing,1
8074,"Some folks may poo on the idea of using an ""aggressive"" shoe like the Kataki for crack climbing",1
8075,But other folks recognize that shoes like the Katana Lace and Kataki can be great for cracks---especially thin cracks,1
8076,Anyway~ that's about it at this point,1
8077,I need to wear them more to have more thoughts on their performance on other terrain,1
8078,My prior experience with the Otaki and Skwama informs some of what I think I'll find,1
8079,For example~ I think the S-heel is a gimmick and doesn't do much~ if anything~ for me,1
8080,I'm really liking this new line from Sportiva,1
8081,When would one choose the Otaki over Kataki?,1
8082,When would one choose the Otaki over Kataki? I personally wouldn't,1
8083,for anything,1
8084,When would one choose the Otaki over Kataki? I love my kataki! They are stiff compared to my skawama,1
8085,But I don’t have to bail out of them at the end of each route,1
8086,I have to women’s so they have to grip rubber compared to edge,1
8087,But I’m only 62 kilos,1
8088,I personally wouldn't,1
8089,for anything Yeah~ i’m curious why la sportiva even designed a velcro system,1
8090,It’s more expensive too~ albeit by 5 bucks.,1
8091,Dude~ it's just a pack.,1
8092,At least try to pretend that this was an unsolicited review...,1
8093,This smells shilly,1
8094,Not too pleased that the design is a rip off of the Mochilla,1
8095,What's the benefit of this pack over buying 2 TUFA's for the same(ish) price? Which does have a movable sternum strap~ doesn't have a G Hook~ and is made in the US,1
8096,Basically what I'm asking is why is this pack double the price of one with less cons and effectively the same set of pros?,1
8097,Damn~ wasn't expecting that response,1
8098,As someone who makes packs and quilts and other gear myself~ the brand really appealed to me from a nerdy gear perspective,1
8099,I made a post about them here~ because I truly found it really interesting,1
8100,I think they fit an interesting niche in the market with they're use of x-pac~ modularity (like cilo)~ and the sizes that they offer (smallest size starts bigger than the mochilla),1
8101,I do not think that any one thing in particular they're doing hasn't been done before~ but I do think that they've chosen a pretty cool combination of features,1
8102,After posting the other thread to see what other people thought and to have a discussion with the other members on here~ Built To Send reached out to me and offered me a discount to enable me to check it out in person and hopefully review,1
8103,I did pay my own money for the pack~ and quite a bit in my opinion~ just at a discount because I really do think that this pack fits my needs well,1
8104,In the review~ I very intentionally didn't compare the pack to any others on the market,1
8105,My goal wasn't to tell you what pack to choose~ as I personally think cilo~ tufa~ CCW~ Alpine Luddites~ and others are all incredible options,1
8106,I didn't want to draw out similarities~ as you all know the others and you can make informed decisions for yourself about the designs without me telling you what to think,1
8107,Whether or not the pack looks too similar to the mochilla~ is up for the individual to decide,1
8108,I personally think they've made their packs to fit into the Alpine climbing category and the mochilla fits a bit more into the leader pack category~ although there is a decent amount of overlap,1
8109,The mochilla expands to 24L~ while the X0 (their smallest pack) expands to 35L,1
8110,That being said~ I'm more than happy for you to have a different opinion,1
8111,Your mileage may vary~ but all I can draw from is my experience with the BD speed zip and the Patagonia ascensionist,1
8112,Both are well designed~ but they both get pretty shredded on granite,1
8113,I've found the dead bird alpha fl is better for durability though,1
8114,I've got news for you if you think the mochilla was some sort of revolutionary bag design...,1
8115,small no-thrills climbing bags tend to all end up pretty similar~ and its been that way for probably 50 years,1
8116,(initially posted in gear discussion forum by mistake) Just got my Crag wagon 45 last week and put it to the test this week-end,1
8117,I was able to load it with the following: - 9.5mm 60m rope (stored in the tarp) - 2 pairs of climbing shoes - 2 harnesses - 2 chalk bag - Sport rack of about 14 draws + slings & biners - small lunch for 2 - 1.5L of water - some spare clothing - flip flops - Full size DSLR with mounted lens There was enough space left in the bag that I could have added a helmet on top easilly (my partner had these),1
8118,Adding a double trad rack would probably mean taking some stuff out as I doubt it would have fit (havn't tried it yet)~ but I'm confident that removing the camera and flip flop would do the trick,1
8119,Worst case I could carry the rope on top of the pack,1
8120,Bag stands erect whether fully loaded or empty~ which is nice,1
8121,The pack carried very well on the moderate approach and I didn't really feel the weigth,1
8122,The frame give a nice sturdiness to the bag and it pretty much feel like a hiking packpack when you have it on,1
8123,The U-shape zipper makes it super easy to access all you gear so you can pack for weight distribution and not worry about what you'll need first once at the crag,1
8124,I liked the 2 gear slings inside the main pocket as it is a convenient place to hang stuff that you need on/off like belay glasses/gri-gri etc without fear of someone stepping on them or having them falling out the bag,1
8125,Top loading when moving to a different area of the crag was super conveninent,1
8126,The top opening is big enough that you can just chuck everything in no problem,1
8127,The top pocket works fine~ but I could wish the two zip pockets inside had more volume built into them as you cannot fit much in there in my opinion~ especially with the zipper on the side and not the top of the pockets,1
8128,If I'm nitpicking I'd also say the leash for the key ring is ridiculously short,1
8129,"That thing is like 3/4"" long and stuck in the corner of the pocket",1
8130,I'll probably add a small entension on it for ease of use,1
8131,The rope tarp that comes with the bag work OK,1
8132,It is on the small side and I'm not sure how that light material will handle the abuse,1
8133,There is a tension strap built into it~ but the tarp material is somewhat slippery~ which makes it hard to tension the strap as the tarps just slips on itself when you pull on the strap,1
8134,Guess it'll take some geting use to,1
8135,Very happy with my purchase so far as that bag is definitively a big improvement over my previous pack (37L hiking pack),1
8136,I have it in the blue version and it does looks nice (for now at least - not sure how the color will handle the dirt),1
8137,My partner has the BD Creek 50 and while his is clearly the most spacious and sturdy bag~ he was looking at mine with some envy when I fully unziped the U shape access :),1
8138,Thank you for the write up,1
8139,I've been weighing the Crag Wagon against the Creek 50~ my one hang up being able to pack in a double rack with everything else,1
8140,The Crag Wagon 60 is an option~ but I feel like that's almost overkill,1
8141,Have you had the chance to see what kind of space you have when loading up with a double rack~ minus the camera and shoes?,1
8142,I'll actually have the chance to try this next week,1
8143,I'll add notes afterwards,1
8144,Any good or bad experiences with this helmet? Durability or build?  It looks like it combines the best of both helmet designs,1
8145,helmet,1
8146,I actually reviewed the Wall Rider for Bentgate Mountaineering,1
8147,Non-biased review~ I really enjoy it and now use it exclusively,1
8148,Bentgate Mountaineering Review - Mammut Wall Rider Helmet,1
8149,I've wondered about this helmet as well,1
8150,I want the Sirocco but the color and shape are..,1
8151,questionable.,1
8152,It's pretty similar to the Sirocco in terms of lightness and comfort but I think it's a lot more comfortable/low profile/better looking.,1
8153,Great write-up~ Lucie.,1
8154,Hi all~ first time chiming in on a thread~ but I think the Sicorro is better,1
8155,I took this on an 8 month South American climbing trip,1
8156,It's light~ good looking~ comfortable~ visor~ headlamp compatible~ sheds icefall well~ etc,1
8157,Pretty much all I need in a helmet~ with the exception of a pretty serious design flaw,1
8158,It was strapped to my backpack on a slippery alpine descent~ and I fell and it broke along the plastic/EPP foam transition when I slipped,1
8159,It's a pretty prominent point of weakness that doesn't exist in a side by side comparison with the Petzl Sirocco (and it's a few bucks cheaper),1
8160,Along each of the three struts on half the helmet! As a mechanical engineer~ I notice that this design could be improved by increasing the bend radii for strain relief~ or just increasing the cross sectional area along the fracture line,1
8161,What a bummer on an otherwise great helmet,1
8162,Hope it's addressed in future revisions~ or my next will be a Sirocco (despite how ugly they are~ they've also got a 3 year guarantee that Mammut doesn't have~ as well as being a few bucks cheaper) Whatever~ I put some GOOP on it and lashed it with tape~ as it'll still shed impacts from above~ and feels as sturdy as the other side,1
8163,To be honest I'm just a little disappointed in the engineering! But yes..,1
8164,it looks good in the crag.,1
8165,I've been very happy with mine after 15+ years in the petzl meteor,1
8166,Very light~ I don't even notice it on my head,1
8167,My only complaint is that the chin buckle slips pretty much every time I wear it,1
8168,I think the last time I adjusted the strap on the meteor was the day I bought it in 2001 or whatever.,1

8180,..,1
8181,maybe~ but it might be a stretch to assume any of the ultralight foam helmets is going to survive being fallen on while it's on the outside of your pack  anyways i have had the wall rider for a few months now and I've been pretty happy,1
8182,durable (at least compared to my friend's BD vapor)~ comfy~ and light,1
8183,Agreed~ it is way more durable than a BD vapor~ and is comfy and light,1
8184,I am still wearing mine after many months,1
8185,Just pointing out the weakness and its alternative since I haven't seen anyone mention it :),1
8186,The new Sirocco  has a top shell just like the mammut..,1

8188,I'm now no longer a satisfied customer,1
8189,After a flight I pulled the wallrider out and two of the support pillars on the left side of the helmet were broken,1
8190,Must've taken my prior Petzl Meteor 3 on 30 or 40 flights with no incident,1
8191,Really not impressed.,1
8192,My wallrider cracked and Mammut replaced no  questions asked,1
8193,I have been more than satisfied with the helmet!,1
8194,My wallrider cracked and Mammut replaced no  questions asked,1
8195,I have been more than satisfied with the helmet! Hmm~ thanks Mike that's good to know,1
8196,How did you arrange that~ just via their website? Overall it is a very comfy and light helmet~ that part remains true...,1
8197,Hmm~ thanks Mike that's good to know,1
8198,How did you arrange that~ just via their website? Overall it is a very comfy and light helmet~ that part remains true..,1
8199,I called and talked to customer service,1
8200,They just asked for a picture and then sent me a new one!,1
8201,I called and talked to customer service,1
8202,They just asked for a picture and then sent me a new one! Thanks Mike~ I'll give that a try.,1
8203,Its really nice  ____________________________ 24*7 assignemnt help,1
8204,I love this helmet - I put too many dents into my old Vector from silly shit so the hardshell is fantastic,1
8205,Also the strap system on this helmet is so simple and works so well.,1
8206,I called and talked to customer service,1
8207,They just asked for a picture and then sent me a new one! I wanted to add that Mammut has now done the same thing for me~ which is impressive,1
8208,I guess going forward I'm going have to just pack my helmet as though I'm packing an egg in my luggage,1
8209,One guy at my local gear shop suggested not checking it at all~ but I've had surprise gate checks too many times to rely on that,1
8210,He also said that the wallrider can pass through the UIAA impact test multiple times~ which my Meteor apparently cannot do.,1
8211,Mine was on the side of my harness and got caught under a rock in a talus field on the approach,1
8212,the side broke off and I superglued and taped it back together for the day of climbing,1
8213,I guess I'll be calling mammut based on people's experiences with customer service,1
8214,Otherwise it has been an awesome helmet,1
8215,Super super light.,1
8216,The helmet durability is questionable..,1
8217,I used mine in everyday usage(sport climbing~ etc...) and it cracked or had foam gouged out just from shoving it into my pack and moving it around,1
8218,I will say~ as others have mentioned~ mammut's customer service is second to none and they sent me a replacement right away,1
8219,They actually sent me another replacement after the foam cracked again,1
8220,I ended up buying a rock rider for sport and multi-pitch trad and will be using the wall rider for alpine missions(or when I just want to lighten my load),1
8221,If you're looking for a a daily driver this probably isn't it~ but works great as a lightweight alpine helmet.,1
8222,Just a little update 2 years on~ my replacement Wall Rider has been good so far~ no further cracking,1
8223,Could just be coincidence~ but since the first one was damaged while in checked airline baggage~ I've been super careful with the second one when flying,1
8224,I pack the inside of it with clothes and place it in the center of my biggest bag~ dome up~ with more soft stuff all around,1
8225,So far so good,1
8226,While the helmet is definitely comfortable and light I don't think I'd buy it again due to the fact that the chin strap (at least on both of mine) is constantly slipping,1
8227,I have found the Wall Rider to be much more durable than the BD Vapor it replaced; have been very happy with the fit,1
8228,too,1
8229,The EPP foam has some flex vs,1
8230,the more rigid EPS foam in many other helmets that tends to crack,1
8231," All of the ""foam"" helmets are less rugged than the old hard shells~ but the weight reduction makes that an easy trade-off for me.",1
8232,Great helmet,1
8233,I just got done climbing all summer in one~ no complaints,1
8234,Very light and the price was right,1
8235,I've owned the Wall Rider~ Meteor~ Vector~ and now the Scirocco,1
8236,I crushed the Wall Rider when it was strapped to the outside of my pack and I dropped the pack without thinking,1
8237,Prior to that~ I thought it was a step up from the Meteor,1
8238,Lighter and more comfortable,1
8239,The Vector only lasted a few months before I noticed cracks in the foam~ whereas the Meteor I got a few years out of without being extra careful,1
8240,I just started using the Scirocco a few weeks ago and it isn't as comfy as the Vector or Wall Rider but is definitely more rugged,1
8241,I swore off foam helmets if I can't get at least a year out of it.,1
8242,This is the only helmet I've ever owned that makes me want to wear a helmet,1
8243,It's light~ has solid ventilation~ and the all webbing strapping is extremely comfortable compared to the plastic tensioners that most other helmets have nowadays,1
8244,That right there is 100% more important than anything else to me,1
8245,For durability~ I am very careful with it during transports,1
8246,It's clear that the foam construction will not handle a sizable load if you drop a bag on it or something of that sort.,1
8247,Dude~ you dropped your pack on your helmet,1
8248,Not exactly a great way to assess durability.,1
8249,I LOVE THIS HELMET,1
8250,I have nothing bad to say,1
8251,Super comfy to wear with or without a hat underneath~ breaths well and is so light you barely notice it,1
8252,The fabric strap closure is magically comfy and doesn't give me headaches like the plastic ones do to me on other helmets,1
8253,I will recommend this helmet to my death,1
8254,I jus TV upgraded from a petzle ecrin after 15 years,1
8255,And I got to say I love it,1
8256,After much struggling to find a shoe that fits comfortably but also performs well I've found a shoe I love; the Tenaya Inti,1
8257,Shoes I've worn~ for reference,1
8258,(Obviously desnt mean they're bad.,1
8259,just didn't work for me.) Anasazi Pink~ Anasazi Pro~ Moccasyms~ Katana Lace~ TC Pro~ Butora Acros~ Scarpa Instinct VS~ Miura VS~ Team Blacks~ Dragons~ Tenaya Mundaka~ and Tenaya Tarifa,1
8260,I'd describe the Inti as a medium-soft~ flexible shoe with added stiffness in the toes for surprisingly excellent edging,1
8261,Sized comfortably it is exceptional for longer routes and smears like a dream while still edging very well,1
8262,Downsized it's ultra good at edging and excellent for vertical to slightly overhanging routes,1
8263,It doesn't seem ideal for cracks or pockets and doesn't heel hook very well,1
8264,It lacks lateral stiffness to comfortably hold up in cracks and the toe isn't ultra precise,1
8265,The Tarifa seems a better option for pockets and I haven't found a good Tenaya shoe for cracks (maybe the Masai~ but they're ultra narrow and don't fit me),1
8266,I like the Inti better for slab AND vertical climbing than any other shoe I've tried and highly recommend it,1
8267,For pockets I'd reach for the Tarifa~ for heel hooks or steep bouldering the Mundaka,1
8268,Highly recommend trying it out for either a versatile shoe or pure vertical to slightly overhanging sport excellence,1
8269,Ideal if you like more flexible shoes but also edging support for your toes.,1
8270,Been climbing in the Iati for a few months and  agree it's great,1
8271,Almost no other shoe fits my foot,1
8272,I'm thinking about picking up the Mundaka as a more aggressive shoe like you said~ but can you compare the two more? Thanks,1
8273,The Inti is the one I reviewed but the Iati is similar to the Tarifa~ which I also use.,1
8274,jeffrey~ what size intis do you wear?,1
8275,Inti US 11.5 for multi-pitch~ 11 for sport,1
8276,Oddly the Tarifa & Mundaka I wear a 10,1
8277,Street shoe is 10.5/11.,1
8278,Has anyone used the newish Black Diamond x Backcountry Stone garden bag? Looks like a good mix for light cragging and gym bag,1
8279,Are there better bags at that price point ($129)?,1
8280,I was looking at that bag as well...,1
8281,After many false annoucements~ it's finally available,1
8282,Just got a hold of one from Trekinn for $55 (though it looks like it just went up $5),1
8283,Solid piece of gear,1
8284,All metal - stainless and aluminum including handle,1
8285,Quality construction; compact; feeds and lowers at least as good as the Grigri IMO and the handle is wide enough to be comfortable,1
8286,Slightly heavier than the Grigri because of the all metal construction but who gives a shit if you're sport climbing or TRing,1
8287,Works with a wide range of ropes (8.5 - 10.5) though I've only used on 9.4 - 9.9.,1
8288,It will have the same problem as the mad rock lifeguard I bet where the handle gets hella hot if you are rapping fixed lines or lowering a heavy load,1
8289,Otherwise~ stoked to grab one.,1
8290,Is the Birdie all Steel or is the outer plate Aluminum like the madrocks?,1
8291,How stiff is the cam spring~ compared to a grigri / lifeguard?,1
8292,Outer plates and handle are the aluminum parts as far as I can tell,1
8293,Cam~ pinch plate and hardware are stainless.,1
8294,I would say that it is equivilent to Grigri 2 spring and not quite as stiff as the MadRcok,1
8295,I would say that it is equivilent to Grigri 2 spring and not quite as stiff as the MadRcok How does it pay out fast for a high clip than? Anyway to over ride the cam without grasping the device~ I don’t think they had a lip on the side of the body?,1
8296,How does it pay out fast for a high clip than? Anyway to over ride the cam without grasping the device~ I don’t think they had a lip on the side of the body? Probably rope dependent somewhat,1
8297,I've only tried it with 9.4 BD and a 10 Sterling (?),1
8298,for me it seems the more pliable the rope the better it feeds,1
8299,It works fine using the two-handed tenchique that Beal shows on their info videos (push/pull),1
8300,It would be interesting to play around with it with a range of different ropes to see how tolerant it is to fast feeding,1
8301,No~ there is no lip on the device like the Grigri but the edge of the plate is rounded and can be fed similar to the Grigri but with my ropes I think it feed freer and faster using the two handed technique,1
8302,It would probably wear quicker though because that part is aluminum,1
8303,Greetings~ My Petzl Coral kind of sucks when fully loaded with my rack,1
8304,I'd like some recommendations on a better TRAD harness,1
8305,My criteria...,1
8306,really happy with the bd solution guide,1
8307,Have you heard of the Misty Mountain Cadillac?,1
8308,+1 for MM caddy,1
8309,I opted for the additional rear gear loop on mine and it's great for whatever your not using mid pitch,1
8310,The stacked side gear loops take some getting used to~  but I really like them,1
8311,It's super comfy on hanging belays and carries weight really well on your hips,1
8312,How do you get the option for extra gear loop? Was just checking them out on moosejaw,1
8313,May have to put in an order.,1
8314,Is this the week of all MMC all the time? Good,1
8315,Instead of a 5th gear loop~ put some of your alpines over your shoulder,1
8316,It will work wonders!,1
8317,I wouldn't bother,1
8318,all harnesses suck if you have a full trad rack on them,1
8319,I just put some pieces or the draws on a gear sling,1
8320,Spreads the weight,1
8321,That way I don't have a sagging~ mega loaded harness,1
8322,And I tend no to put everything on the sling if it's a big rack,1
8323,Otherwise it's hard to select gear from the middle of the pack,1
8324,the tradeoff of a big waist belt or big wall harness is less mobility,1
8325,Arc'teryx FL-365 is the most comfortable harness with huge gear oops I've found,1
8326,Love it.,1
8327,Again for the Misty Mountain Cadillac,1
8328,I got a custom one last year with double back buckles and a second belay loop,1
8329,Buckles never creep~ and I love all the gear loops,1
8330,Fantastic harness,1
8331,Comfy too.,1
8332,Another vote for MM Cadillac,1
8333,They have a harness builder on their website but if you call them~ they’ll do pretty much anything you ask,1
8334,I’ve had gear loops in different places~ custom colours~ all kinds of stuff over the years,1
8335,Edited to add: As others have mentioned~ there are other ways to lighten the load on your harness,1
8336,I’m skinny so I hate a fully loaded harness~ it just sags,1
8337,- 3-4 single slings with biners over your shoulder eliminates the need for so many draws,1
8338,- use a prussic cord to secure your chalk bag..,1
8339,one less thing on your harness - ultralight running hydration bladder and/or an 8-10l pack is great to avoid water bottles and/or shoes being clipped to your harness,1
8340,- don’t carry crap you don’t need (ascender~ pulley~ etc),1
8341,Got a new Caddy for $65 on Ebay,1
8342,woot woot.,1
8343,Misty mountain Cadillac all the way,1
8344,Had MM Cadillac,1
8345,Did not like the size or configuration of the gear loops,1
8346,Gave it away,1
8347,The Singing Rock Dome is perfect for me,1
8348,Comfy,1
8349,Huge gear loops (right on the side of the harness),1
8350,$60! Has held up great,1
8351,Saw a crew member for Jimmy Chin wearing one while filming Free Solo.,1
8352,Dmm renegade,1
8353,7 loops~ feels like a normal harness~ not a big waller,1
8354,If you are going to be carrying gear only on your harness I really like the BD Big Gun,1
8355,The waist belts don’t seem to deform or sag when loaded down like other do,1
8356,It’s far from a perfect harness but when I need to carry a lot of crap it’s the one I always go back to,1
8357,2nd on the dmm renegade 2 harness,1
8358,Best harness I've ever had,1
8359,7 gear loops~ super comfy,1
8360,I usually carry doubles from .3 to 3 and there is plenty of room,1
8361,The pad on the waist loops also slides so you can always have the harness centered,1
8362,The Petzl Adjama is super rad for trad,1
8363,It’s comfy but not too bulky and the 5th gear loop on the back is super nice to have,1
8364,Just ordered a singing rock dome,1
8365,Looks sweet!,1
8366,I’m very happy with my Yates Shield harness.,1
8367,Ok~ so I got the Cadillac,1
8368,It was on my doorstep last night upon returning from beautiful/lovely Tahquitz,1
8369,The first thing I noticed was the padding,1
8370,There's really not much difference between the padding on that and my Petzl Corax,1
8371,The padding feels stiff and is nowhere near as thick as I was imagining for harness that I want to wear for extended hours,1
8372,My question would be~ first~ for those who have experience with the Cadillac and who have responded with alternatives,1
8373,Among the Renegade~ Big Gun~ Shield~ FL-365 and Dome - which has the padding?  I tried the Caddy on last night,1
8374,It felt comfortable enough but that was not racked,1
8375,The padding feels stiff,1
8376,I want something soft and cushy,1
8377,Thanks for the assists peeps,1
8378,You don’t want soft and cushy~ soft and cushy breaks down fast,1
8379,You want wider surface area with firm supportive padding,1
8380,Bottom line is that no matter what harness you get a true hanging belay sucks~ you just want to minimize how much suck,1
8381,You don’t want soft and cushy~ soft and cushy breaks down fast,1
8382,You want wider surface area with firm supportive padding,1
8383,Bottom line is that no matter what harness you get a true hanging belay sucks~ you just want to minimize how much suck,1
8384,Well ok~ I still want it but I won't try and find soft/cushy,1
8385,I guess I'll rack the caddy today and go play and see how it feels,1
8386,It checked the boxes on loops,1
8387,I was in a similar situation to you when I started getting into trad and I went with the Arc'teryx 395a and I'm super happy with it,1
8388,It has pretty much no padding~ but makes up for it by having a super wide belt and leg loops,1
8389,I was a little skeptical because the MM Cadillac and BD Big Gun looked like they had so much more padding~ but I read reviews saying that the 395a was more comfortable and lighter,1
8390,I haven't tried those so i can't say for sure how they compare~ but the Arc'teryx is WAY more comfy than than my old Petzl Sama~ the gear loops are enormous compared to the sama~ and it packs down small enough to fit in my helmet for the approach,1
8391,If i had to do it again I would get the FL-365 because i haven't needed to adjust the leg loops at all,1
8392,Even with the softest~ fluffiest padding~ you're still going to wind up with all of your weight resting on some narrow straps~ and that soft fluffy padding is going to be mostly compressed when you're hanging,1
8393,The thing that makes more of a difference IMO is the width of the straps,1
8394,The padding on the MM might feel stiff~ but the belt and leg loops are significantly wider than those on the corax and that's what will make the difference in comfort,1
8395,With this in mind~ i feel that the Arc'teryx harness brilliantly does away with the bulky padding and leaves you with broad straps that spread the weight of your hanging body over a larger area without saddling you with an extra quarter pound of foam.,1
8396,^ exactly,1
8397,The width of the thin/low-profile FL-365 makes it incredibly comfy~ yet low bulk with huge gear loops.,1
8398,the arcteryx also does a lot really well,1
8399,sport climbing~ strip it down,1
8400,trad~ load it up,1
8401,ice climbing~ it's got clipper slots in the right spots~ doesn't soak like a padded one would.,1
8402,Try a bunch of harnesses on~ buy the one that fits~ and has the features you want~ and none of the features you don't want,1
8403,I’m a Misty Mountain guy for life,1
8404,But I’ve climbed in a lot of Arc’Teryx harnesses and they are legit,1
8405,Super comfy and light weight,1
8406,If I ever stray from my beloved Cadillac and Turbo~ it will be for deadbird,1
8407,And I hate to say it~ but the BD harness that will be available in January looks amazing,1
8408,Don’t think they’re gonna bring out a fully featured trad one right away~ but there will be one down the line.,1
8409,Dmm Renegade 2.,1
8410,Arcteryx AR395a (adjustable leg loops),1
8411,Padding is overrated~ you need to properly spread the load over a large area without it folding over,1
8412,Arc'teryx has mastered this~ no bulk~ no extra weight~ no padding to pick up moisture and prevent ventilation,1
8413,Black Diamond gear loops are often too narrow to hold a double rack without piggy backing pieces on each other.,1
8414,I have the Petzl Adjama and DMM Renegade 2,1
8415,I prefer the Renegade of the two for my trad climbing but for what you're describing (maximum comfort) you might look at something like the BD Big Gun,1
8416,It's quite tall (large surface area) and reasonably padded,1
8417,I really like my Petzl Adjama,1
8418,The new one has a 5th gear loop on the back and it works wonders,1
8419,Of course I only had 4 loops prior to this harness so anything is a step up,1
8420,It's reasonably comfy at belays and handles my trad rack just fine,1
8421,As other people have said~ I've also heard good things about the MM Cadilac~ but I've never used it,1
8422,So be able to try them on is the rub,1
8423,I'm in San Diego,1
8424,We got REI and Adventure 16,1
8425,They aren't carrying these harnesses to try on~ hence my posting this and seeking the wisdom from the collective dirtbag community,1
8426,BTW~ thank you all for the responses,1
8427,I've been in Nomads my last two Tahquitz trips but was after cams and biners so I didn't look to see if they had any of the harnesses mentioned in this thread,1
8428,I'll check this weekend,1
8429,I loaded the MM Caddy today with a double rack,1
8430,It was comfortable enough despite what felt like overly stiff padding,1
8431,It seemed to sag a bit,1
8432,Yes~ I've read the comments that they all sag,1
8433,I'm speaking in relative terms,1
8434,The belt being wider then my Petzyl~ I was expecting less sag,1
8435,I pulled it up and gave another tug and cinched it down a bit tighter and it seemed a bit better,1
8436,I guess the jury is still out,1
8437,I need to play with my rack arrangement and its loops,1
8438,My first racking didn't seem to take advantage of the gear loops..,1
8439,kinda of sh!# show,1
8440,Lastly~ I didn't think it would be a thing but my first wife's name was Misty and seeing that name prominently displayed keeps stirring up old memories~ some good~ some bad,1
8441,I might have to bail on the caddy for that reason alone,1
8442,:) So.......,1
8443,I thank you all again for the feedback,1
8444,It's really helping to make an educated decision in choosing an upgrade,1
8445,I'll be sure to pass along the golden nuggets to others as well.,1
8446,Another vote for a 395a,1
8447,I have not used the new adjama~ but the old one is the worst harness I have ever used.,1
8448,So I actually clicked this because the snarky asshole in me wanted to say “any harness is a trad hardness...” apologies But at risking thread drift: AFAIK~ the latest update to Petzl Corax removed the ice clipper slots,1
8449,Any long time Corax users who have been satisfied with that model~ need clipper slots~ and found an acceptable alternative? Might be moot because I’m still ~1-2 years from needing a new one,1
8450,I usually replace when the protectant webbing for the lower tie in wears through.,1
8451,I think the Cadillac is comfortable~ not because of the thickness of the padding~ but the because of the width of the waist portion of the harness,1
8452,Your weight is distributed over a wider section of the harness~ resulting in more comfort.,1
8453,Yeah~ the Adjama has the worst gear loop alignment possible,1
8454,They lay flat and are overlapping,1
8455,As an aside~ when I want lots of rack space I climb with a grivel lynx pack,1
8456,The pack is removable  if you just want to climb with the harness for the loops,1
8457,The lower loops (on red webbing) act like a second set of loops in the harness area and I use the chest loops for hold my next cam placement if I am in a good stance and my next placement won't be (easier to reach than harness),1
8458,It also works well as I share a rack with wife so we can just switch the pack back and forth,1
8459,I hate regular gear slings and prefer harness racking...,1
8460,Which the pack mimics well while adding flexibility and more loops!  The 10 ish liter pack is even set up to be able to swing around to your front  for access without taking the pack/harness off~ pretty clever design,1
8461,If you are swinging leads it is way easier and less of a chance of dropping gear to just have a sling over your shoulder with all the cams(fancy people buy stuff like what Nick posted),1
8462,Reason is you just pull it off and pass it to the leader and they take off,1
8463,Its piece of cake,1
8464,Putting a bunch of cams on your harness means you risk dropping one when you are switching gear,1
8465,Plus it is super annoying in OW.,1
8466,Word of warning~ if you climb a lot of layback or chimney you'll tear through the front gear loops on the Adjama,1
8467,The plastic inserts are great at keeping the shape of the loops~ but provide a wear point,1
8468,I've had two friends drop a rack of cams because they wore through their loops,1
8469,The size of the middle loops are tiny (I have a small~ maybe the larges are different)~ front loops can easily carry a rack of cams each~ and the back loop is wonderful,1
8470,The desert is quite rough on gear~ but this type of failure felt excessive and unprecedented,1
8471,Everything is annoying in OW~ lol!,1
8472," We're on MP~ so all harness threads end up the same: ""MiStY MoUnTaIn CaDiLlAc!"" Nah~ that harness sucks; I honestly don't understand why everyone is so enamored with it",1
8473,Too big and bulky~ padding holds on to sweat and stays wet all day~ it doesn't pack down as nice as others~ and 6 weirdly stacked gear loops (why are you people are adding even more?! how much shit do you take with you?!)...It's more of a lightweight wall harness,1
8474,I drank the koolaid years ago and ordered one; absolutely hated free climbing in it,1
8475,Before you all get your flamethrowers out~ I'm not bagging on MM,1
8476,The harness I received was well built and the customer service was fantastic,1
8477,I just don't think the cadillac is good for free climbing,1
8478,Something like the intrepid or maybe the sonic would probably be better,1
8479,IDK~ I've never tried those so YMMV,1
8480,IMO~ the arcteryx ar-XXX (the one with adjustable leg loops) is a really great free climbing/sport/trad/ice harness that's very comfortable and packs quite small,1
8481,Worth the few extra bucks every 5-7 years imho,1
8482,REI carries them so you can probably try it on there (or order online/return there)~ or if you're really in a gear desert~ order a few different ones from one of the big etailers and return what doesn't fit/feel right (unused w/ tags of course).,1
8483,I am going to guess you are a smaller~ or a least a thinner person,1
8484," I absolutely loved the two Cadillacs I had~ but I am on the bigger/fatter end of the climber spectrum (6'2""~ 200 lbs.) and the adjustability~ comfort and durability had me sold the first couple pitches",1
8485,There is a secret spot for gear in Escondido,1
8486,Another one in Temecula,1
8487,Sounds like you've been to their store in Idywild,1
8488,Not sure what their rules are for trying on harnesses or what they have in stock~ however,1
8489,I just wrote in another thread that I really liked the Arcteryx and I saw a lot of good reviews about such equipment even here,1
8490,For me it is very smartly designed to weigh a lot less but still offer loads of support and allow you to feel as comfortable as possible.,1

8520,I’ve tried the old MMC with the black fleece covering and it doesn’t breath well so it gets damp and causes raspberries,1
8521,But I haven’t tried a newer one,1
8522,The Calidris with it’s I frame construction is light for such a wide~ comfy harness and breathes really well,1
8523,I use it for trad and big wall,1
8524,Only 4 gear loops though~ The back ones are pretty big,1
8525,Tighten your harness when on as high as possible,1
8526,Well above your hips,1
8527,I like a gear sling for the rack because the cleaner can hand the whole rack back to the leader all organized in one shot,1
8528,I put my slings etc on my harness,1
8529,I don’t like over the shoulder slings cause they can be hard to take off,1
8530,I have a lot of money,1
8531,Still doesn't justify a 'fancy' harness,1

8533,Having a lot of money means not having to decide between a nice harness and more cams! Look if the Momentum works for you that’s awesome,1
8534,For single pitch cragging~ that is a pretty good harness for the money,1
8535,But most of the climbing community agrees that once you decide to go 500-1000 feet off the ground~ you want more and/or bigger gear loops~ for example,1

8539,I like beer,1
8540,Just to mitigate confusion with similarly named devices the one I will be discussing is shown below,1
8541,I´ve tested the alpineUp back to back against a large selection of other devices and measured some of it´s parameters as well,1
8542,Feeding it takes more effort to pull the rope through than all but one other device,1
8543,Lowering in locking mode,1
8544,O.k with a heavy climber on overhanging rock otherwise rubbish or impossible,1
8545,Rapping in locking mode-No,1
8546,Dynamic mode-the weakest belay device I´ve ever measured and about 1/2 the power of an ATC,1
8547,Be good with little kids but nothing else,1
8548,Rapping I didn´t bother with testing,1
8549,Top-roping in locking mode-too much effort to pull the rope through.3/10,1
8550,Braking performance- the best of this sort of device by far 8/10,1
8551,Guide mode- I never use this so no idea~ the Smart Alpine was better in our pull-through force tests but lowering appears a challenge with them all,1
8552,The only time I would possibly use this device is with my 7.8mm twin/half ropes where the braking performance is good but due to it´s size and complexity it hasn´t repaced my current device with two karabiners which gives coparable performance,1
8553,In our comparison test days cragging the assisted locking devices were all left on the side after trying them and everybody went back to the usual ATC XP/Grigri combination.,1
8554,Ah well~ I prefer not to do reviews just testing since a lot in a review is personal taste~ they are usually of dubious value anyway,1
8555,"For example the review above gives lowering ""9/10 if using a proper rope",1
8556,"Much less if not."" which is ludicrous since I tried a lot of ""proper"" climbing ropes and couldn´t lower a substantial climber with a lot of them~ a disciple that nearly all belay devices master effortlessly",1
8557,My Grigri worked every time and so did my ATC XP so where´s 9 from 10 come from?   For thin half/twin ropes it´s good~ for single ropes up to it´s maximum rating it isn´t.,1
8558,Reading your comments makes me wonder if we are actually talking about the same device,1
8559,(Are you using it with the supplied biner?),1
8560,I have been using the alpine up for 2 years and it is by far the best belay/rapel device I have used in 35 years of climbing,1
8561,It lead belays very well playing out rope easily and assist locks reliably~ better in my mind than A grigri,1
8562,Top rope belay is great because you can lock the line and still take up slack,1
8563,I have worried about lowering but the release lever works well,1
8564,Rapelling is very nice with the ability to go hands free at a ny time,1
8565,It does twist my rope rapelling sometimes,1
8566,Sometimes the twisting is very bad~ sometimes not at all,1
8567,I have yet to figure out what makes the difference,1
8568,I agree with the reviewer's review,1
8569,And yeah it seems pretty heavy when I am thinking I want to go light.,1
8570," ""Jim Titt wrote:   Lowering in locking mode",1
8571,O.k with a heavy climber on overhanging rock otherwise rubbish or impossible,1
8572,"Rapping in locking mode-No."" ""I do this all the time",1
8573,Used 10+mm single ropes and 7.5mm twins~ and all kinds of diameters in between,1
8574,Never had an issue,1
8575,"Really like the added security of the click up as it allows me to go hands free if needed to clear rope tangles and the like.""   Yup~ that´s why I keep well away from reviews of this kind generally",1
8576,It´s not clear from your reply whether you are talking about lowering or rappelling but both the OP and myself found with thick ropes it was a considerable problem if not impossible,1
8577,If you are talking about rappelling then you should be aware that your thoughts on a single 10+mm rope in locking mode are irrelevant as this is forbidden by the manufacturers,1
8578,"""Attention! The self-locking abseil with a single rope is not allowed""",1
8579,(Quite why rapping is forbidden when one would hope belaying with a single strand will function is not clear),1
8580,"That there is an addendum to the instructions of how to facilitate abseiling ""when it is quite difficult"" involving adding another karabiner somewhat discouraged me from testing this aspect~ with some of my ropes it was doomed to failure anyway.",1
8581,I will try to make it very clear:   When lowering a climber (for example~ on a sport route~ where my partner has clipped the chains and I am lowering him to the ground) I have never had any problems lowering in click-up mode,1
8582,I've used a single Sterling 9.8~ single Sterling 9.4~ an Edelweiss 10.5~ and an Edelrid that I'm not entirely sure of the diameter~ but somewhere in the 9.5mm range I would guess,1
8583,No problems lowering my partner on any of these ropes,1
8584,This is true on overhanging sport routes~ and slabby trad routes,1
8585,When rappelling~ I always rappel on two ropes,1
8586,When I write about rapping on single ropes~ I mean that I am rapping on two strands of a rope that is rated as a single rope (as opposed to a half or twin rating.)  I don't meant that I am rappelling on a single strand of rope,1
8587,I've rapped on ropes from Edelrid~ Sterling~ Edelweiss~ and a couple of ropes I don't know the brands of~ in diameters from 7.5mm to 10.5mm,1
8588,Never had any issues,1
8589,Never had to resort to adding another carabiner as shown in the video,1
8590,Starting out on low angle terrain~ with a lot of rope beneath me~ I will sometimes use my non-brake hand to raise the trailing rope above the device to make feeding easier,1
8591,It's not a hassle~ however~ and I've always been able to manage a smooth and controlled descent,1
8592,I'm not sure how you could even have an opinion on the subject of rappelling if you didn't test this aspect of use yourself,1
8593,Bottom line is that I've done thousands of feet of belaying and rappelling with this device with a wide variety of rope diameters and types,1
8594,I have yet to find a situation in which it did not perform well~ and in most cases~ it works better than any other device I've used.,1
8595,I have used the standard Clip-Up device quite a bit~ and found that it is picky with belay carabiners,1
8596,For example~ the Metolius Gatekeeper does not allow the Click-Up to orient correctly into locked position~ and will therefore allow some rope to slip through with body weight applied,1
8597,"Funny considering they market it as a carabiner tailored to ""semi-automatic belay devices""",1
8598,I found the BD Gridlock to be an excellent pair with the Click-up,1
8599,I'm betting these details also apply to the Alpine Up~ but would like to hear more feedback in that regard.,1
8600," folks   regardless of the merits of the device~ i would be VERY careful in saying the the words ""hands free"" about it in assisted braking mode   ive seen plenty of folks use devices such as the smart~ gri gri and etc taking their hands off because someone told em it was ""hands free""   ;)",1
8601,CT lists the rope range for the Alpine up as 7.3-10.5mm~ and my guess that Jim tested the range the manufacturer claims,1
8602,I've been yapping for years that manufacturers claim ridiculous ranges for their devices~ none of which perform well at the ends of the advertised spectrum~ suffering handing problems at the large end and friction problems at the small end,1
8603,I've suggested that the middle third of the claimed ranges is more likely to be the range for adequate performance; that would be about 8.3-9.5mm for the Alpine Up,1
8604,Of course~ that's too narrow a range for marketing purposes~ but my guess is performance will not be so good outside those narrow limits,1
8605,I've experimented with the extra carabiner CT suggests to mitigate the effect of rope weight making it hard to descend when rapping in the locking orientation,1
8606,It works and is smooth on my 8.5's~ but it introduces so much twisting in the strands that I gave up on it early on,1
8607,I don't have any rappel troubles most of the time,1
8608,If the rappel is long and overhanging~ so that I have the full weight of 60m of rope on the device~ then the rope has to be fed in for twenty or thirty feet~ at which point it works normally.,1
8609,Just my 2-cents from the field using an Alpine Up this spring/summer season on a sterling 9.2 Evolution Aero Dry~ which is a fairly soft rope,1
8610,I won't even try to score anything -- just some subjective observations from use in the local mountains during some class 4 and easy-5 alpine climbing and descents,1
8611,Belaying with a single line in dynamic mode~ it's controllable,1
8612,But I wouldn't take my eyes off the leader if there was any chance of a hard fall,1
8613,To be honest~ I'd prefer two carabiners under my ATC guide for a dynamic belay on a single strand of the Aero,1
8614,In assisted mode~ I'd want to be able to move around~ as with a Grigri,1
8615,However~ I think I slightly prefer the feel of the Alpine Up's lock-off to that of a Grigri,1
8616,I haven't tried using it from a lead,1
8617,Rappelling~ I use it in assisted mode,1
8618,It's very controlable on the doubled line using the supplied carabiner,1
8619,A BD Rocklock will also work in the device~ but I think it makes the locking action somewhat more aggressive,1
8620,I haven't had any reason to try the second carabiner feed,1
8621,It can be locked hands-free~ though I do always keep something else on the rope,1
8622,I could jug on it if necessary by locking-off my backup above the device,1
8623,For me~ the assisted locking during rappels is its greatest appeal,1
8624,Seems to be wearing fairly well with just the usual anodizing being rubbed off~ and the plastic handle seems fine,1
8625,Doesn't appear to impart any undue rope twist~ though the rope is getting rather fuzzy,1
8626,As mentioned at the top~ threading a rope means un-tethering the device~ which is a little disconcerting.,1
8627,Never owned one but seems to me this device is comparable to Mega Jul ...,1
8628,It is comparable only in that both are assisted locking devices,1
8629,Other than that~ it is very different~ and the substantial differences are enumerated and cataloged all over the internet if you are interested in comparing them.,1
8630,Nope,1
8631,The Mega Jul is inferior to the Alpine Up for half ropes.,1
8632,I agree with Rgold on this one~ I bought a megajul shortly after buying a pair of bluewater 8.4s and was pretty disappointed,1
8633,"Despite testing it with about a dozen different lockers it provided a lot less friction than just about any other belay device I ""tested""",1
8634,It turns out that its great for a single rope though and is pretty much all I use for singles nowadays,1
8635,"   The microjul is a different story~ it works better than any other device I ""tested"" on the fuzzy 8.4's and feeds well enough to provide a good belay even without using the thumb loop",1
8636,For the biner I've settled on the omega pacific jake~ for both the mega and micro and with a bunch of different rope diameters,1
8637,It seems to consistently provide the most friction,1
8638,I wouldn't mind giving the alpine up a go but the price and weight are a bit much,1
8639,Rgold~ have you tried the micro on your doubles?,1
8640,Anything further on this?,1
8641,Thanks! Thanks for all the work you put into this too,1
8642,I really appreciate the threads where a few of you get on a tear and a ton of great information starts flying! Best~ H.,1
8643,I know this is an old thread~ but I'm looking info purchasing this device for my slippery 9mm Millet rope,1
8644,Peoples opinions on it seem mixed~ but the general consensus online seems to be that it works better on thin soft rope~ but I'm curious if you guys think it would work well on a thin triple rated rope like mine.,1
8645,Awesome~ thank you! Also do you think it would be possible to set it up in a yo-yo/RAD system?,1
8646,I just bought one today~ as my one device to rule them all,1
8647,I have a couple of questions for experienced Alpine Up users,1
8648,When multipitch trad climbing / alpine climbing with trad protection~ do you use Click-Up mode~ or Dynamic? Instructions state to only use Click Up mode on bolt-protected routes~ and I understand that the assisted locking could give a harder catch / place more stress on the gear,1
8649,But I feel that the advantages of the assisted braking outweigh the disadvantages in most cases~ and understand the Dynamic mode is not very strong,1
8650,What have your experiences been?  When belaying a second from above~ and the anchor does not lend itself to guide mode~ what is your preferred method of bringing up the second? From harness direct to belayer~ or via redirect? In Click-up mode or Dynamic?  Any other heads-up for new user?  Thanks :-),1

From harness direct to belayer~ or via redirect? In Click-up mode or Dynamic?  Any other heads-up for new user?  Thanks :-)  I use the click up mode for belaying the leader---I don't think there's enough friction in the dynamic mode for 8.5 mm ropes,1
8656,I mostly belay seconds with the device clipped to the rope loop on my harness with a snug tie-in,1
8657,Although the device pumps out slack really well~ you can lock it up every now and then,1
8658,The release technique is to place the heels of both hands on the bottom of the device and shove it away from your body,1
8659,This same technique is needed at the base of most rappels in order to release the device when there is still some rope tension on it from the rappel,1
8660,It might be the most awkward of all the devices to thread~ and it would be a good idea to work out a protocol so that you don't drop it,1
8661,Alternatively~ you can use the hole at the base to clip the device to you with a quickdraw while you are threading it.,1
8662,The only time I ever use dynamic mode is if I have to use a super fat rope,1
8663,I've caught plenty of whips on bolts and on gear~ and that is on chossy sandstone which will crumble under significant force,1
8664,It may result in a higher impact force but~ like you~ I have determined that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages for my use,1
8665,I've top belayed in all three configurations and while guide mode is my preference if the situation allows~ it works fine with a redirect or direct of the harness,1
8666,I would say your decision between redirect and harness belay should be based more on the situation than the device because it works fine in either configuration,1
8667,For these uses~ I don't see a reason to use dynamic mode unless~ again~ you're using a super fat rope,1
8668,The only other heads up I would give is to make sure you use the belay biner that comes with it exclusively,1
8669,A biner with a different width cross section could both cause it to lock up while feeding slack or~ even worse~ fail to lock up if it is too fat to travel up into the slot.,1
8670,Is the Alpine Up at all useful for single ropes? I am very happy with the Click Up for single ropes in the 9.4-9.8mm range (so far--haven't had it very long) but I think I'm going to still have to bring my DMM Pivot for rapping and guide mode~ so it would be nice to have a single device that could do both,1
8671,But I've read a lot online that seems to indicate it's intended only for two ropes,1
8672,Has anyone used the Alpine Up for single ropes? EDIT: The other possibility I'm considering is single-strand rapping using the Click Up~ with a system like this,1
8673,I can make do without guide mode (I rarely do it anyway),1
8674,I'll have to experiment a bit with the device before I decide whether I like that.,1

8680,When I want a retrievable rap (so two strands) with my Grigri I just leave one end tied in my harness~ thread the rap ring/bolt/karabiner or whatever and lower myself on the other strand~ can´t see why it has to be made any more complicated.,1
8681,yes you can use the alpine up for single ropes,1
8682,The only thing is that it may not lock up without a brake hand on single strand belay or rap.,1

8684,If I'm understanding you correctly~ doesn't this wear down the anchor hardware just as much as having your follower lower you? The reason I would rap down in the first place is because the local ethic is to rap to preserve the anchor hardware,1
8685,I almost always choose lowering over rapping when the local ethic allows it~ but then I have my follower lower me~ rather than lowering myself,1
8686,The technique you describe is useful if your follower is incapacitated somehow and you have to get down solo~ though.,1

From harness direct to belayer~ or via redirect? In Click-up mode or Dynamic?  Any other heads-up for new user?  Thanks :-)  I use it in brake assisted mode,1
8692,That for me is the whole reason for owning it,1
8693,Although keep in mind that I've found that it does not go into lock mode with an incapacitated or poor belayer that doesn't~ or can't~ keep their hand on the brake strand during a fall,1
8694,For this reason alone~ I choose to use it only for half rope lead belaying,1
8695,For single rope lead belaying I prefer a different brake assisted belay device that will lock up without a hand on the brake strand,1
8696,This is why the Alpine Up is not a one device to rule them all for me,1
8697,I think I've used it in dynamic mode once with a leader who was using old school thick half ropes that kept unintentionally locking the device when feeding slack,1
8698,After hearing what people have said about the dynamic mode not being very powerful I'm going to want to safely test that myself to see what I think before using it again,1
8699,It should work fine in any of your top belay situations~ although like Eli mentioned which one you use should be dependent on what you have to work with for your anchor and the rock formations up top,1
8700,Given the choice I'd use it guide mode when ever I can,1
8701,It's great! I like to setup the extra carabiner sitting cross wise over the carabiner holding the rope so I can give slack at a moments notice if called for,1

8715,When I pay for it and then put the shit in~ it tends to be places where there are few if any folks~ and I do exactly what Jim does,1
8716,I don't mind if others do it either,1
8717,When I first got my AlpineUp~ I did some hands off whipper tests with knots tied below the device,1
8718,It caught about 9/10 falls,1
8719,The one that failed to catch was on very stiff rope,1

8723,I'm pretty sure from what I read from Jim Titt's and Rgold's posts that the Grigri is certified as fully auto locking (I may not have the exact wording correct)~ and most everything else is manual brake assist,1
8724,And if I remember correctly it has more to do with catching a factor two fall with no belayer input pulling the brake strand upwards,1
8725,Despite this somewhat legal interpretation~ there are some devices like the Mammut Alpine Smart Belay~ Edelrid Megajul~ and Grigri that I'd much rather have being used to belay me in the scenario of an incapacitated belayer that can't hold the brake strand~ or an unattended brake strand from poor belay technique,1
8726,It's not perfect mind you~ but I know in most circumstances from the experience of using them that they will lock on their own even if the belayer can't or is not holding the brake strand,1
8727,Both myself and Rgold have tested the brake assist feature on the Alpine Up in the scenario of an un-attended belayer without a hand on the brake strand,1
8728,I did it in a gym on lead taking a fall slightly above the second clip with a thick bouldering pad below me,1
8729,I used single ropes of different thicknesses and tested it several times with each rope,1
8730,Each time I decked onto the pad with the Alpine Up,1
8731,Doing this same test with a Grigri 1 and 2~ Alpine Smart Belay~ and Megajul I was caught each time,1
8732,I believe Rgold did his tests with his half ropes~ but I'll let him speak for himself about that,1
8733,I have a suspicion that it may auto lock without a hand on the brake strand with half ropes right near it's 9mm max half rope size~ or with two single ropes of the same size or larger,1
8734,My observation of rappelling with my 9.2mm single rope is~ that if you take it out of lock mode it will go right back into lock mode if you put weight on it without a hand or any resistance on the brake strand,1
8735,I discovered this on a traverse I had to make to the next rappel anchor as I walked over to it on the ledge I landed on keeping my brake hand really loose on the brake strand,1
8736,I've also used the Alpine Up with a climbing partner's old school half ropes that is as he claims as close to 9mm as he could buy at the time,1
8737,Part way up the climb I had to have him temporarily anchor himself so I could switch to dynamic mode belaying on the Alpine Up as it kept going into lock mode while feeding slack and shorting him,1
8738,Don't though take this second paragraph as completely tested stuff~ because I haven't taken the time to really test these scenarios to see when it does and doesn't happen,1
8739,The video you posted doesn't tell us what diameter the ropes they are using are,1
8740,From what I can make of the foreign language~ all they tell us is that it is an 8m fall with 70kg of weight and they figure it is a fall factor of 0.8,1
8741,If they are thicker ropes~ then I could see this potentially working reliably,1
8742,Although you wouldn't enjoy lead belaying in brake assisted mode with these ropes as it would probably constantly go into lock mode as you feed slack,1
8743,I also question the positioning of the Alpine Up in that video,1
8744,It might be a lot different hanging off a persons harness than the anchor setup they use,1
8745,If you have a friend or someone in a local gym who owns one~ ask them about it and even see if you can try it out before you buy,1
8746,There is no one brake assisted belay device that does it all really well,1
8747,In my own experience they all seem to have trade offs where one device does one thing better or worse than another,1
8748,So you have to figure out what you want to do with it and what you are expecting out of it to match it up to the use case,1
8749,If I'm understanding you correctly~ doesn't this wear down the anchor hardware just as much as having your follower lower you? When you lower yourself~ tension on each strand of the rope is only half (roughly) of your bodyweight,1
8750,When your belayer lowers you~ the tension on each strand of the rope is your full bodyweight,1
8751,So lowering yourself place more wear on the hardware than rappelling~ but not as much as getting lowered by your belayer,1
8752,Both myself and Rgold have tested the brake assist feature on the Alpine Up in the scenario of an un-attended belayer without a hand on the brake strand,1
8753,I did it in a gym on lead taking a fall slightly above the second clip with a thick bouldering pad below me,1
8754,I used single ropes of different thicknesses and tested it several times with each rope,1
8755,Each time I decked onto the pad with the Alpine Up,1
8756,Doing this same test with a Grigri 1 and 2~ Alpine Smart Belay~ and Megajul I was caught each time,1
8757,I believe Rgold did his tests with his half ropes~ but I'll let him speak for himself about that,1
8758,That's really good information! Thanks for taking the time to do these tests and share your results!,1
8759,Local ethics differ,1
8760,In this instance~ I suspect Jim was the one who put the hardware in,1
8761,When I pay for it and then put the shit in~ it tends to be places where there are few if any folks~ and I do exactly what Jim does,1
8762,I don't mind if others do it either,1
8763,That make sense~ but if lowering is acceptable I find it easier to have my belayer do it~ so I don't see a case where I'd use the self-lowering method,1
8764,It sounds like this is just a preference thing~ though.,1
8765,If I'm understanding you correctly~ doesn't this wear down the anchor hardware just as much as having your follower lower you? The reason I would rap down in the first place is because the local ethic is to rap to preserve the anchor hardware,1
8766,I almost always choose lowering over rapping when the local ethic allows it~ but then I have my follower lower me~ rather than lowering myself,1
8767,The technique you describe is useful if your follower is incapacitated somehow and you have to get down solo~ though,1
8768,I was thinking about rapping down multi-pitch routes and that sort of thing,1
8769,I´ve never rapped off a single-pitch sport route~ we always lower.,1
8770,When you lower yourself~ tension on each strand of the rope is only half (roughly) of your bodyweight,1
8771,When your belayer lowers you~ the tension on each strand of the rope is your full bodyweight,1
8772,So lowering yourself place more wear on the hardware than rappelling~ but not as much as getting lowered by your belayer,1
8773,Ah~ right,1
8774,I was thinking of this as being the same as having your belayer lower you~ but it's not,1
8775,Given this is somewhere between lowering and a two-strand rappel~ I don't think I've ever come across a local community opinion on this case,1
8776,Some local ethics prohibit the belayer lowering~ but given this is kinder to the hardware~ it might be okay,1
8777,That said~ I've been told that the AMGA now recommends belayer lowering~ and as more crags adopt this recommendation this would become a moot point.,1
8778,I was thinking about rapping down multi-pitch routes and that sort of thing,1
8779,I´ve never rapped off a single-pitch sport route~ we always lower,1
8780,Ah~ makes sense,1
8781,So if your partner wants to rap down after you~ how do they get down?,1
8782,That's really good information! Thanks for taking the time to do these tests and share your results! You're welcome David,1
8783,I wish I could say I did it out of kindness to the general climbing public to let everyone know how these devices work,1
8784,It was more out of self preservation to know what to expect from these devices,1
8785,So there you have it,1
8786,Ah~ makes sense,1
8787,So if your partner wants to rap down after you~ how do they get down? I could be on my own~ my partner could have a different device~ they just do the same as me or I just lower them,1
8788,We always get down somehow:-),1
8789,Thanks all for the responses~ interesting and useful,1
8790,"My partner and I tried it out in the gym last night - much to the consternation of the gym staff~ who had never heard of it and were therefore unable to ""certify"" us safe in its use! I ended up demonstrating it to them~ they checked it out on the internet~ then they watched us using it and certified us - so  I'm now a certified safe user :-)  I was using my gym rope~ a somewhat elderly and stiff (like its owner?!) 10mm single~ which is not really its intended use~ but wanted to get a feeling for it in a relatively safe environment",1
8791,The rope is probably at the upper end of its usable range~ and it wasn't a great experience,1
8792,Feeding the device is a bit finicky~ but easy enough,1
8793,On the first climb~ we both short roped each other several times~ and while we got better at it over the night~ we could only avoid locking it up on quick clips by having a little extra slack out and being very smooth with feeding rope,1
8794,Locking up on falls was immaculate~ works very well,1
8795,Found it quite hard to unlock~ with some practise could sometimes unlock with one hand~ but sometimes had to use two~ and had to take care to keep maintaining the brake hand while unlocking with two hands,1
8796,Lowering was easy~ no strain  very controlled~ but a little slow~ especially when there was a lot of friction on the rope,1
8797,Feeding and taking back the rope was completely natural to an ATC user~ and I realised that I probably locked up the ATC involuntarily on feeding as often as with this~ but didn't notice it really because the ATC is so easy to unbind,1
8798,After lowering a climber~ we struggled to unlock the device to feed more slack / un-thread the device - having the lowered climber go all the way to sitting position then standing up to un-weight the rope helped.~  Overall~ all worked as advertised~ but all felt a little clunky~ probably because I'm working with a rope at the upper end of its range,1
8799,I bought it for outdoor use~ where I lead on skinny singles (9.4) and half-ropes,1
8800,Now that I have a feel for it~ I'm looking forward to using it in this application.,1
8801,Alex~  Yeah~ thicker 10mm and up and stiffer ropes are an issue with the Alpine Up and do not make it a joy to use,1
8802,The only exception being if the thicker rope is not stiff it can be acceptable but not great,1
8803,You'll find it works much easier with thinner and more pliable ropes,1
8804,The technique I use for unlocking the device is different than what Climbing Technology shows you to do with one hand that doesn't work for me,1
8805,With the brake hand firmly gripping the brake strand near the Alpine Up~ place the edge of the palm of that hand near your wrist on the back side of it~ and the other hand the edge of the palm goes on the front side,1
8806,This allows you to pinch the Alpine Up between your two hands and push it away from you to unlock it,1
8807,If your coming from having used only ATC's for years..,1
8808,I find that a lot of these brake assisted belay devices require the flaked rope to be right in front of the belayer,1
8809,Otherwise the friction of the rope dragging across the carpet of the gym~ or ground outside~ if the pile is off to the side or behind you~ makes it really challenging to feed slack,1
8810,And in the case of the Alpine Up may encourage it to lock up unintentionally if you are not purposefully feeding the brake strand into the device as you pull slack on the other hand,1
8811,Alex~  Yeah~ thicker 10mm and up and stiffer ropes are an issue with the Alpine Up and do not make it a joy to use,1

8821,I forgot to mention in any of these Alpine Up threads~ when I tried it out at the gym~ I was using a very fat rope (10.2?),1
8822,It worked great anyway~ but the rope was dry treated and basically brand new,1
8823,Last I heard~ one of these is coming my way for Mother's day,1
8824,That fat rope is all I personally have now~ so we'll see,1
8825,One of my partners has a slick~ skinny~ alpine rope~ so it can get both ends tested,1
8826,One of the things I like about the device is how it holds in my small hands,1
8827,It is not dependant on fingers or thumb in specific locations (no buttons~ levers~ or loops to mess with) you can just work out how to use it~ palm~ whole hand~ left hand~ right....whatever you need to do or are comfortable with,1
8828,I've not belayed double ropes yet~ but for myself~ a device that lets you work your hands how it suits you could be even more important,1
8829,Working the device with your palm leaves your fingers for rope management,1
8830,Best~ OLH,1

8840,Best~ OLH Wasn't mother's day last sunday? FWIW~ I've never had an issue with feeding rope with fat ropes,1
8841,The extra friction certainly makes it more physical work and demands less sloppy technique but I've never had it lock up while I was feeding slack~ even with a stiff old fat 10.5mm rope,1
8842,The issue I've experienced with fat ropes is that lowering the climber with super fat ropes requires you to actually pull the rope through the device,1
8843,When the ropes are fat enough~ just pulling the lever down all the way isn't enough so you pull the climber's strand up~ which is very tiring,1
8844,On the other hand~ I don't think it is fair to fault the alpine up specifically for its issues with super fat ropes because every single assisted braking device on the market is also going to suck with those ropes,1
8845,At that point your only option for smooth feeding is an ATC style device or stitch plate.,1

8852,Good to know,1
8853,I'm really considering getting one~ since it does everything I'm looking for at the moment (assisted locking~ hands free rap~ guide mode),1
8854,My only concern now is the only rope I have is a 10.2,1
8855,Its still pretty new and slick~ but as it ages~ I want to make sure I'll be ok,1
8856,OLH~ very curious to hear about your experience after you get your hands on one!,1
8857,Good to know,1
8858,I'm really considering getting one~ since it does everything I'm looking for at the moment (assisted locking~ hands free rap~ guide mode),1
8859,My only concern now is the only rope I have is a 10.2,1
8860,Its still pretty new and slick~ but as it ages~ I want to make sure I'll be ok,1
8861,OLH~ very curious to hear about your experience after you get your hands on one! It should work fine with your rope at least for now,1
8862,When it gets old~ stiff~ and fat it will become more of a hassle to use with the Up~ but that'll also teach you not to use sloppy technique~ which IMO isn't really a bad thing,1
8863,It may suck while lowering~ though~ but that can be remedied to some extent by using a heavier partner as well as doing steeper climbs,1
8864,Another option is to just use the dynamic mode which functions like a tuber,1
8865,I've read (but my experiences doesn't support this) that you don't get a lot of friction with the dynamic mode~ but in this scenario you're using a thick rope so you should be fine friction wise,1
8866,With such thick ropes and assisted braking devices~ you essentially can choose between it feeding well while your climber is climbing (alpine up)~ it feeding well while your climber is getting lowered (camming style devices)~ or sucking at both (alpine smart~ mega jul),1
8867,Eli~ this creature was in Yosemite for mother's day,1
8868,Which means I was also short a climbing partner,1
8869,All~ when I get it~ I will let you know how it goes,1
8870,I'm hoping to get lead certified at one or both gyms shortly~ then we can throw a top rope backup belay on a lead climber and thrash away,1
8871,Best~ OLH,1
8872,Love mine for the last 3 years,1
8873,Never use Guide mode,1
8874,Twins and smaller than 10MM is all I ever use,1
8875,I belay sport and trad with it and despite a few quirks to use it efficiently I recommend it,1
8876,EFR,1
8877,I just bought my third Alpine Up to loan to beginners,1
8878,The second was given as a present to my regular climbing partner,1
8879,I believe the alpine up to have the best balance of features and function for the type of climbing I most commonly do (multipitch trad),1
8880,My ropes are a mammut serenity 8.9 (single/double/twin)~ a pair of mammut 8.0 twins/doubles and rarely a edelrid 9.5,1
8881,I use the guide mode which works well enough with the skinnier ropes and a little unpleasant with the 9.5,1
8882,In general the Alpine Up works better on the thinner ropes,1
8883,My first one is about 5 years old and I love it although it goes through belay carabiners other than the supplied one pretty quickly and replacements for the supplied one are not readily available,1
8884,It turns out the Edelrid Bruce steel locking carabiner has a very similar shape and being made of steel does not show any wear after a couple of years,1
8885,The bruce is engineered to be reasonably light for a steel carabiner (134 grams) but heavier that the original (77 grams),1
8886,I see https://www.trekkinn.com/outdoor-mountain/climbing-technology-concept-sgl/136337429/p is now carrying them.,1
8887,UK Climbing just published a review (https://www.ukclimbing.com/gear/review.php?id=9402) of assisted-braking devices in which the Click-Up came out as the best of the lot~ which included both Grigris~ the Smart~ the Matik~ and the Salewa Ergo~ which appears to be a model cloned by BD for their ATC-Pilot,1
8888,These are subjective usage tests~ without quantification (unexplained bar graphs notwithstanding)~ not the kind of rigorous standard-based testing you get from Jim Titt~ and have nothing to say about the behavior of the devices in extreme circumstances,1
8889,"That said~ this is a  rare user comparison of a whole bunch of devices~ rather than the more common ""I switched to Gadget X and it's awesome"" type of review",1
8890," Well in the text it´s actually;- ""For belaying at climbing walls and outdoor sport climbing this is our 'best in test' for new users~""  It probably it is more idiot-proof than the Grigri~ but taken as a functional belay device for all-round usage by an experienced climber the GriGri is still the better device",1
8891,Lowering we found difficult in high-friction circumstances as we found it impossible to remove enough friction (and in fact swapped to a GriGri just to get the climber down)~ not being able to abseil meanigfully wasn´t cool and the value for money once you start buying a new karabiner every year or so is terrible but then that´s the case with all of this type,1
8892,The best of it´s type braking wise but a Grigri it isn´t for many reasons.,1
8893,Yes~ that is in the text~ but also in the text is For this article we have chosen seven current devices...The devices were tested over a period of months at Awesome Walls in Sheffield and outdoors at various crags including in Finale Oltra in Italy,1
8894,While testing we focussed primarily on use for indoor and outdoor sport climbing~ rope feed to leader~ lowering off and fall catching...The main aim is to introduce these devices to people who haven't used one~ or who are unfamiliar with the various options,1
8895,I don't do a lot of sport climbing,1
8896,Indoors~ I use either a Grigri or a Reverso~ depending on the gym,1
8897,I gave up on my Alpine Up as a gym device almost immediately,1
8898,The main point of interest for me was the review's confirmation of my own experience with the Smart and Juls---the Alpine Up seems to me to be a significantly better mousetrap.,1
8899,Yes~ that is in the text~ but also in the text is I don't do a lot of sport climbing,1

8903,Hm? You gave up on your Alpine Up~ but consider it a better mousetrap? Just outdoors?  OLH,1
8904," Hm? You gave up on your Alpine Up~ but consider it a better mousetrap? Just outdoors?  OLH For climbing with double ropes the Alpine Up is by a long way the best of the ""assisted"" braking devices though the limited gains don´t justify the downsides in my opinion",1
8905,For single-rope climbing there´s no reason to use it in preference to a number of better devices.,1
8906," For climbing with double ropes the Alpine Up is by a long way the best of the ""assisted"" braking devices though the limited gains don´t justify the downsides in my opinion",1
8907,For single-rope climbing there´s no reason to use it in preference to a number of better devices,1
8908,Sorry if youve outlined this already but which would you recommend for single ropes? I'm assuming you need a combo ie a grigri and a regular old ATC to be able to belay~ rap~ belay up second etc.,1

8910,For single-rope climbing there´s no reason to use it in preference to a number of better devices,1
8911,Sure~ unless you want something that can rap~ is assisted braking~ and doesn't require you to learn a new technique to belay,1
8912,In which case it is the only option,1
8913,Just don't use it with really fat ropes.,1
8914,Hm? You gave up on your Alpine Up~ but consider it a better mousetrap? Just outdoors?  OLH Yes just outdoors~ and with half ropes at that,1
8915,But it isn't indoors/outdoors~ its just that a lot of gym ropes are too fat for the UP,1
8916,I never tried the smart or jul on fat ropes so don't know how they compare.,1
8917,Sorry if youve outlined this already but which would you recommend for single ropes? I'm assuming you need a combo ie a grigri and a regular old ATC to be able to belay~ rap~ belay up second etc,1
8918,Single-pitch sport climbing I use a GriGri (we never rap off)~ otherwise an ATC XP,1
8919,Trying to make one device that does everything means it will do many things poorly and it´s better to have a range of options~ as indeed rgold does~ choosing the best tool for the circumstances,1
8920,If I was only permitted one device for all my climbing it would be an ATC XP,1
8921,Sure~ unless you want something that can rap~ is assisted braking~ and doesn't require you to learn a new technique to belay,1
8922,In which case it is the only option,1
8923,Just don't use it with really fat ropes,1
8924,"Except rappeling is not the greatest experience in the world with reasonably thick ropes unless you use the horrific system CT developed to reduce the friction (anyone actually ever used this?)~ ""assisted"" braking is available elsewhere and more reliably",1
8925,Learning a new belay technique isn´t exactly difficult and you will have to do it with the Alpine UP anyway the first time you short-rope your partner since releasing the locked mode isn´t exactly standard practice with a conventional plate,1
8926,Having to choose ropes depending on the belay device is putting the cart before the horse~ the decision on which rope to use is governed by many factors and either ones device should be able to cope with all the sizes we use OR you use a number of different devices,1
8927,Expecting a climbing gym (or your partner) to provide a super-slick 9.2mm rope to suit your choice of device is unrealistic.,1
8928,I've used the alpine up with ropes up to stiff old fat 10.2 and I've never had it lock up while trying to feed slack,1
8929,And I rarely use ropes thicker than 9.8 anyways so my personal choice of ropes~ as well as my partners~ works well with the device,1
8930,That said~ I don't do much gym climbing~ and when I do I use it in dynamic mode which functions just like an ATC,1
8931,YMMV,1
8932,Not sure why you referenced this review here~ Rich~ as it does not review the Alpine Up~ just the Click Up,1
8933,The Click Up looks great for gym climbers or single pitch sport climbers who never plan to rap - a good solution for very limited application,1
8934,I think it was a missed opportunity not reviewing the Alpine Up.,1

8937,I think it was a missed opportunity not reviewing the Alpine Up,1
8938,I referenced it because the locking mechanism is identical to the UP,1
8939,In regard to Jim's question~ I have used the CT workaround for rappelling~ although with 8.5mm ropes it isn't needed,1
8940,It did make things a little smoother at the start of free-hanging rappels with a lot of rope weight~ but it also twisted the ropes horribly and so is not a solution that is of any use to me,1
8941,With 60m of 8.5mm ropes hanging on the device~ I have to feed the rope into it for the first  5-10m or so before it feeds on its own,1
8942,This can be done very smoothly if you use a hand-over-hand technique on the brake strand,1
8943,For all less-specatucular rappels~ the device is just fine on 8.5's.,1
8944,Sure~ unless you want something that can rap~ is assisted braking~ and doesn't require you to learn a new technique to belay,1
8945,In which case it is the only option,1
8946,Just don't use it with really fat ropes,1
8947,not the only option~ see the Mad Rock Lifeguard,1
8948," Except rappeling is not the greatest experience in the world with reasonably thick ropes unless you use the horrific system CT developed to reduce the friction (anyone actually ever used this?)~ ""assisted"" braking is available elsewhere and more reliably",1
8949,Learning a new belay technique isn´t exactly difficult and you will have to do it with the Alpine UP anyway the first time you short-rope your partner since releasing the locked mode isn´t exactly standard practice with a conventional plate,1
8950,Having to choose ropes depending on the belay device is putting the cart before the horse~ the decision on which rope to use is governed by many factors and either ones device should be able to cope with all the sizes we use OR you use a number of different devices,1
8951,Expecting a climbing gym (or your partner) to provide a super-slick 9.2mm rope to suit your choice of device is unrealistic,1
8952,I'm not sure what device passes the criteria of being able to handle any rope~ though,1
8953,The GriGri2 certainly doesn't--I've come across gym topropes that were too thick for it quite frequently (at gyms which leave GriGris on the ropes~ ironically),1
8954,There's nothing wrong with having gear that works together~ such as a rope that works well with your belay devices,1
8955,I certainly appreciate gear that's widely applicable (i.e,1
8956,I haven't found a rope that my Sterling HollowBlock doesn't friction well on),1
8957,But I've not yet used a belay device that works well with all ropes~ or even as broad a range as the manufacturer claims their devices work with,1
8958,That said~ who are these people using 10.5mm rope for sport climbing? It's not a problem I've run into.,1
8959,UK Climbing just published a review (https://www.ukclimbing.com/gear/review.php?id=9402) of assisted-braking devices in which the Click-Up came out as the best of the lot~ which included both Grigris~ the Smart~ the Matik~ and the Salewa Ergo~ which appears to be a model cloned by BD for their ATC-Pilot,1
8960,These are subjective usage tests~ without quantification (unexplained bar graphs notwithstanding)~ not the kind of rigorous standard-based testing you get from Jim Titt~ and have nothing to say about the behavior of the devices in extreme circumstances,1
8961,"That said~ this is a  rare user comparison of a whole bunch of devices~ rather than the more common ""I switched to Gadget X and it's awesome"" type of review",1
8962,I've noted before that my main reason for switching to the Click Up is that it feeds rope better than the GriGri2,1
8963,People who have not used the Click Up have responded claiming that it must be because I'm using the GriGri2 wrong,1
8964,But the review also notes that the Click Up is good for feeding rope~ giving it the highest rating of any device for rope feeding~ better than either GriGri,1
8965,So at least I'm not the only crazy person who thinks the Click Up is easy to use.,1

8973,My ATC XP copes with ever rope I´ve ever tried~ real thin ones I just add a karabiner or two,1
8974,Which I why I carry it in preference to the Alpine Up on trad routes,1

8983,Jim~  Are you saying that you add an extra karabiner while belaying?  I think this is necessary to get adequate friction for even moderately thin single and slick ropes,1
8984,I asked black diamond about this and they seemed confused but said it would be ok if I wanted to,1
8985,I have seen several people add an extra karabiner while rappelling but I have never seen anyone use two karabiners while belaying,1
8986,I think if you need more friction rappelling then you need more friction belaying,1
8987,The alpine up specs single ropes from 8.6 - 10.5 mm and from personal experience it works well with 8.9 mm ropes,1
8988,I am very concerned being belayed with an ATC and a single karabiner on the 8.9 mm single rope,1
8989,I believe it is likely that with two karabiners that the ATC would work adequately with my 8.9 rope; just no one uses two karabiners.,1
8990,Jim~ what sort of carabiniers and how are you clipping them (with your ATC XP for extra friction)?  One of my group has a really skinny alpine rope~ slick as can be! Thanks~ Helen Just double (or triple) up on whatever HMS karabiner you normally use~ they MUST all be clipped into the belay loop.,1

8998,I´ve no experience with a single 8.9mm rope (never climb on things that small) but tested single strands of double ropes for sure,1
8999,I use extra karabiners with my 7.8mm ropes~ things are getting pretty marginal if you don´t! One of the big advantages of conventional plates is to be able to adjust the level of braking force they provide~ either reducing it with a loose karabiner or increasing it with extra karabiners,1

9009,I have been trying to understand your comments from other threads for quite a while and came to the conclusion that you must be using multiple karabiners while belaying,1

9044,Just got mine - this thing is so cool! I mainly got it for half rope use~ but will be trying it for single rope use too,1
9045,Was at my door when I got home from climbing today~ but did basic tests at home,1
9046,The assisted locking works great with 8.5 doubles and 9.5 single~ it even worked with double 6mm cord! Belaying off the anchor with a 9.5 single seemed to require more effort than a GiGi..,1
9047,Didn't try with the 8.5s~ assume fine,1
9048,For multipitch I always have a GiGi and partner a GriGri w/ an ATC for rappel,1
9049,Maybe with this device we can get by with the GiGi and the Alpine Up,1

9053," If you need two carabiners for that~ you need them for belaying as well."" This is not necessarily true",1
9054,If the person you are belaying is much lighter than you~ there is a possibility that you don't need to use double carabiners for belaying,1
9055,It really depends on the diameter of the rope and the weight of your partner(s).,1
9056,Long story short~ price makes no difference and I am wondering which of these shoes is best for sport climbing~ especially for slabbier stuff because I already have a good bouldering/steep shoe (Evolv Shamans),1
9057,Any input is much appreciated.,1
9058,The difference in performance is negligible,1
9059,The difference in fit is not,1
9060,Try them on,1
9061,Mal,1
9062,if you want it for slab~ the Katana lace is the only choice out of those three,1
9063,The last on a sportiva shoe has a number associated with it~ the higher the number~ the more asymmetric and down turned the shoe,1
9064,Genius is PD 85 and designed for competition climbing which is anything but slab,1
9065,"Kataki says ""steep edging"" in the description~ again not slab and has a last of PD75",1
9066,I have the Otaki which is the velcro version and unless its vertical or steeper~ they crush my feet,1
9067,Katana lace is relatively flat lasted at PD55 and has a small stiffener under the big toe,1
9068,Sam the last numbers of sportiva are deceptive~ at least the way we think of them,1
9069,The kataki actually has a lower volume toe box than the katana lace~ kataki does not knuckle up your big toe at all,1
9070,From the side brand new the kataki looks more downturned~ but it’s really just a long camber from a higher arch,1
9071,Their description of the kataki is pretty off on the steep edging too,1
9072,It’s great on thinner vertical to slab edging~ but steep edging they’re no testarossa,1
9073,Men’s version with xs edge would be a good candidate for thin edging,1
9074,The women’s with grip is great if you’re doing more smearing/smedging,1
9075,I have both for different types of rock,1
9076,The katana lace is also a good choice for thin edging,1
9077,With the full length rubber sole they give a little more support~ but they also don’t smear as easily as the men’s kataki,1
9078,Fit is also different~ kataki is narrower and has a LOT more rand tension on the Achilles,1
9079,Genius can work great on smedging type rock like grit and sandstone,1
9080,Wouldn’t want it on true thin edging,1
9081,I've been thinking about getting a good two way radio for either assisting communication with my partner between long pitches or between two different parties,1
9082,Do any of you find radios useful while climbing and what do you think I should consider when buying one for this purpose,1
9083,I'm wondering if a low end radio should be good enough or if it's worth it to buy one with a few more features or more power,1
9084,I definitely want one that's waterproof but don't need a lot of bells and whistles necessarily,1
9085,I don't have much experience with radios outside of the military so let me know what you've used and how it worked out for you,1
9086,Thanks,1
9087,For the type of climbing i like to do (rock/snow/ice)~ slightly heavier and not-low-end models are most effective,1
9088,Specifically~ these are my priorities for my type of climbing: completely weather-sealed~ long-term resistant to breaking while banging against rock~ having a physical knob for power and volume (useful for gloves and frequent volume changes or power-offs)~ high power output (rock blocks radio very quickly~ we rarely climb line-of-sight)~ long battery life~ NOAA forecast~ and having a strong attachment point for a lanyard/biner/etc,1
9089,I've shifted to accepting ~2-3oz more weight penalty per radio~ in exchange for higher performance and longer life,1
9090,I used to go for ultra light and low cost~ but that led to almost no objective being met: they're crappy in transmit power (no point of having radios if they are unable to connect)~ break more easily~ and are more cumbersome to use,1
9091,"The above criteria has gradually converged me to the Motorola ""rugged"" series",1
9092,This pair of radios has held up the best out of the ~6 pairs (of other radio brands/types/styles) used over the past ~10 years,1
9093,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072LAAA0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 So this could be one option for your consideration,1
9094,There are probably other/better ones too depending on your objective (and also for mine)~ and I'll when these die/break i'll research newer/better ones...,1
9095,high power output (rock blocks radio very quickly~ we rarely climb line-of-sight) So I did use radios on one climb and we had a lot of trouble with them do to not having line of sight,1
9096,We basically stopped using them halfway through because they were mostly worthless,1
9097,I don't recall the model/quality of those radios but how much trouble do you have with the higher end radios? Also do you happen to know if UHF or VHF is preferred for this purpose? I vaguely remember my comms classes from a long time ago and I don't know enough about why either is used,1
9098,https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/107174218/2-way-radios-for-climbing https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/110028214/two-way-radio https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/108258902/walkie-talkie-suggestions-please#ForumMessage-108259251 https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/107249201/communicating-on-multi-pitch-routes#ForumMessage-107252099,1
9099,I actually have good experience with 2-way radio's even without line of sight,1
9100,My longest rope is 70meters and have no issues with the reception on that distance~ even if it's slightly over a corner,1
9101,Not sure if the EU frequencies just works better? We do have less channels and in a some area's you get lots of other people on the same channel,1
9102,So keep saying those rope commands with names,1
9103,Saves so much time and gives you certainty about the rope commands,1
9104,Long traverses are terrible for verbal and rope tug communication,1
9105,I do have the radio's as plan C~ Plan A is yelling~ plan B tugs.,1
9106,i think I posted a similar response~ probably in one of the links above,1
9107,But I find walkie talkies very helpful on multipitch routes,1
9108,I use a cheap $40 pair from rei,1
9109,They are small and I wouldn't be torn up if they broke on a climb~ as they get banged around pretty good,1
9110,Obviously they don't replace knowing how to communicate with rope tugs but having the option to have a conversation when you're a rope length away from your partner and it's windy as hell is super nice,1
9111,Also I'm a whimp and tend to only climb easier wandering routes that put a decent amount of rock between my belayer and myself and I have never had any signal issues with my very cheap walkies,1
9112,For snowmobiling in the mountains I use Midland GXT1000VP4 and have been quite happy,1
9113,In the same valley they have always had reception with great range,1
9114,You'll always be limited by line of sight~ but here was an extreme example,1
9115,On a training hike up Mt Si my friend picked up friends down on Mt Rainier doing crevasse rescue practice: https://caltopo.com/m/RD2T,1
9116,That said~ now that Morse is off the test~ Ham seems not so hard to pass,1
9117,that was always the holdup for me,1
9118,Also~ I never had luck with FRS,1
9119,Great for line of sight~ but a roof or two and it wouldn’t connect.,1
9120,I am setting up a rope-walking system and when looking at ascenders~ I came across NewDoar,1
9121,I've never heard of them~ they seem to sell mostly on Amazon~ and their prices are suspiciously cheap--entire ascender kits are cheaper than an ascender from other companies,1
9122,But if they're the real deal it's a good deal~ and I'm more willing to take a risk because in this case the ascenders won't be used for a safety-critical application,1
9123,Does anyone have any experience with this company and/or their ascenders?,1
9124,UIAA does not know about them,1
9125,https://safety.theuiaa.org/front/front_search_certified_labels.php I know you're saying it's not safety critical (even though I don't understand~) but the UIAA search is a basic smell test for me as to whether someone's shittyshady.,1
9126,With my rope walking setup I'd be using the foot and knee ascenders to ascend the rope~ but when not ascending my weight would be resting on a progress capture device at my waist (which I already have),1
9127,The progress capture device is a Micro Traxion~ which I've fallen on during top rope solo a lot~ so I trust it.,1
9128,eh~ it's just for the rope walking as you say~ so i don't see a problem,1
9129,your real device is trusted~ so i'd be personally fine with that,1
9130,i don't know if the convenience of rope walking for ascension is worth $70 though ;) but i already own jugs and ladders.,1
9131,Yeah~ I don't have jugs and ladders! So I've tried out a few other people's systems and am going with the system I like the best for what I'm trying to do.,1
9132,SUT Chinese junk,1
9133,No thanks.,1
9134,Just checked out the site,1
9135,The poor language and verbiage is a red flag~ just wait for a sale or buy genuine brands secondhand,1
9136,Tenaya shoes are freakin' amazing,1
9137,I've tried them all on and the Tarifa is my personal favorite,1
9138,Slightly different fit than the others and perfect for my foot,1
9139,So I'd definitely recommend trying it against the Iati to see which fits better~ otherwise they are pretty damn close for stiffness vs sensitivity,1
9140,I went 9.5 in Tarifas and it's slightly curled toes~ not at all painful~ perfect,1
9141,Street shoe 10.5/11,1
9142,Anasazi Pinks & Moccs in 10.5,1
9143,Two nights in the gym and the Iatis are broken in and fit like a glove,1
9144,The Masai are simply too narrow at the same size,1
9145,I would have to jump up to streee shoe size to be comfy so my son has absconded with them and is in love with the shoes,1
9146,He’s climbing with them over his Moira’s,1
9147,As for the Iati~ I believe it’s a perfect shoe for someone with flat feet and a wide forefoot,1
9148,If I was a glutton for punishment or had narrower feet I’m sure I could go 1.5 sizes down from street,1
9149,But with my foot shape~ 1 size down was ideal,1
9150,Overall impressions,1
9151,Great shoe for those who don’t need massively downturned or super soft aggressive shoes but still need performance when jumping up in grades and the Mythos just are not cutting it,1
9152,And as I write this a number of folks have dropped the price to $125 in the states,1
9153,Epic TV is still the cheapest,1
9154,And it only took 5 days from France to Louisiana,1
9155,Although we may get preferential shipping since we speak the same language here.,1
9156,I just picked up a pair of Ras as an all day trad shoe and I'm liking them so far,1
9157,I also found the Masais to be too narrow for my feet~ so went with the Ra instead,1
9158,I have a size 5 in the Iati which is amazingly comfortable for how tight they are and 6.5 in the Ra (same as I wear for street shoe size) which allows my toes to be flat,1
9159,My buddy and I were going Royal Arches to Crest Jewel in Yosemite this weekend,1
9160,Neither of us are experienced slab climbers,1
9161,4 pitches into Crest Jewel~ we decided we just weren't having fun,1
9162,It was stressful~ mildly dangerous~ and slow,1
9163,I remembered we had an Escaper with us (pitches were too long for our 70m rope to rap)! Setup: Pretty easy and straightforward,1
9164,There are instructions on the bag~ too,1
9165,Just make sure you follow them and lace the rope properly,1
9166,When the first person rapped~ we tied a knot in the tail of the Escaper to prevent it from slipping through~ with some slack to see if the rope slipped through when we didn't want it to,1
9167,Pros:  It works,1
9168,It's very~ very~ very unlikely to suddenly drop you,1
9169,You'd have to be continuously weighting and unweighting the rope,1
9170,It's lightweight and easy to use,1
9171,Faster than doing single-pitch raps by a long shot,1
9172,Cons:  On non-slab climbs the Escaper & rope's knot may get caught below you,1
9173,That would be bad,1
9174,If you rap past your anchors and have to jug back up~ your follower needs to keep an eye on it to make sure the jugging doesn't loosen it,1
9175,You have to rap off a single bolt/piece,1
9176,The escaper belongs to my friend~ but I'm going to get one now,1
9177,That and some quicklinks could save my butt in the future,1
9178,Haha~ I've also bailed off that climb,1
9179,10a slab in yosemite is no joke!  I didn't see a need for an extra device though - was the only real benefit to your escape that you could go further~ faster? This wouldn't be the case on many climbs were longer rappels will lead to stuck ropes,1
9180,You blew it as the crux was behind you,1
9181,:(,1
9182,It won't kill you but if your rappel goes over blocky terrain (isn't pure slab or vertical the whole way down) prepare to spend a lot of time tugging on it with no results~ until the point you think your arms are going to fall off and then it will finally release~ hopefully.,1
9183,I mean~ it did finally release,1
9184,Happy I didn't go flailing down that slope~ though - I'll give you that,1
9185,You get to leave twice as fast,1
9186,Stuck ropes are definitely a possibility~ but not much more likely than normal rapelling,1
9187,You could even say that even though it's more likely to get caught~ it has half as many opportunities to do so,1
9188,Even on the 5.8 stuff we weren't having a good time,1
9189,It's just not my style,1
9190,Don't use quick links~ use bail 'biners instead in...3...2...1,1
9191,Even on the 5.8 stuff we weren't having a good time,1
9192,It's just not my style,1
9193,No worries bro the descent from North Dome sucks balls~ you did well,1
9194,It sounds like the rope touching rock is causing pinching points that doesn’t allow the Escaper to fully extend each time the rope is pulled downward,1
9195,All the stretch in the rope has to be pulled out before it can extend,1
9196,I’ve found it only takes around eight cycles of it fully extending to release.,1
9197,Unless you get off route and do a full pitch with no pro only to see the bolt down and left with you in terrain harder than 5.10 and your partner too far down to help you  out with any toilet paper when you shit your pants in fear,1
9198,(my buddy~ except he kept it together and made the moves or it would have been a world class tumble),1
9199,Even I bailed off that Climb.,1
9200,..,1
9201,or it might,1
9202,Or~ you might kill yourself using it,1
9203,Seems to me the BE is best used as an emergency piece,1
9204,You're hanging on a releasable hitch which could be released with any bouncing action,1
9205,Also~ as others have suggested~ the hitch could be difficult to release over blocky terrain and be prone to snagging,1
9206,Also~ what is the lifespan of these things?  How much wear before that dyneema wrap fails to generate adequate friction? No way would I ever carry a BE intending to use it~ even in the alpine,1
9207,There are better ways to save weight.,1
9208,With the short amount of rope that passes through it each time~ and dyneema being very chafe resistant~ as long as the stitching holds up~ it is unlikely to deteriorate and not function for a long time.,1
9209,Better ways to save the weight of an extra rope or tagline? Please enlighten us all to how you save 2-3kg by swapping out a single piece of kit,1
9210,Had an opportunity to use this quite a bit last month when a group of us ganged up on a wall in City of Rocks,1
9211,The route was 140’ so we needed to set up  rappels each time but didn’t have enough ropes for each pair of to climb and rap,1
9212,All of a sudden one of our group pulled out the Escaper he had been carrying around for a year and said~ “We should try this”,1
9213,The wall had about 100’ of vertical with a low angle finishing slab and~ as usual~ lots of plates and chicken heads and even a bush~ to tangle the rope,1
9214,Beal says this is a worst case scenario,1
9215,The thing worked perfectly,1
9216,With 2 people at the rap anchors we backed up the rig with a sling to the bolts and the second person down could watch what was going as the Escaper did its thing,1
9217,The first person down did everything they could on the way down to defeat the Escaper: walked around on ledges~ climbed up a bit and dropped onto the rap lines~ swung sideways etc,1
9218,The rope didn’t creep even a millimeter,1
9219,The only problem was pulling it down,1
9220,Because of the slab finish it took 30-40 pulls to get it down,1
9221,We found the the pulls had to be very sharp jerks with clean releases,1
9222,Long firm tugs didn’t work,1
9223,On a steeper route later in the day~ it was perfect,1
9224,8-9 pulls did the trick,1
9225,With just a couple of caveats~ the Escaper is now part of my multi-pitch kit,1
9226,It fits in the back pocket of my Mammut Pulti-Pitch Chalk Bag along with my phone and Petzl E-light,1
9227,Caveat #1 - If your group is ganging up on a wall that is more than a half rope length you’ll still need two ropes to top rope with,1
9228,Caveat #2 - We were worried that the Escaper would get tangled up in plates~ chickenheads and bushes,1
9229,While we did get the rope stuck it wasn’t the Escaper that got stuck,1
9230,It is no worse than pulling down any stuck rope,1
9231,Caveat #3 - This will scare your friends,1
9232,Rating: 5 Star,1
9233,As always~ Malcolm Daly gets 5 stars~ too.,1
9234,I've had a PETZL Sirocco helmet for a year and I like it a lot,1
9235,But my buckle just broke during my yearly Christmas trip to Joshua Tree,1
9236,Before the Sirocco I had been wearing a 1993 Joe Brown helmet,1
9237,It blew a rivet~ so this Sirocco looked very attractive,1
9238,It's super light~ and as long as I stuff something inside it (to protect it from crushing)~ I can pack my pack normally and it survived until last week,1
9239,The buckle Petzl uses is very fragile,1
9240,The plastic snap tabs are ultra small,1
9241,There is a magnet inside the buckle that helps pull it closed,1
9242,Unfortunately~ the magnet also attracts iron ore~ of which there is a lot in Jtree,1
9243,I was constantly having to scrape and blow out the sand stuck to the magnet before it would snap,1
9244,"Finally~ up on the ""Heart of Darkness"" route~ one side of the buckle broke completely",1
9245,I had to borrow a helmet that day,1
9246,When I got back to camp I replaced the buckle with one I bought at the jtree climbing store,1
9247,To get the old buckles off~ I shaved down the plastic with a razor knife until I could slide the nylon out of the old buckles,1
9248,Then I prusiked on the new buckle~ extended the strap with some tubular nylon using a water knot and had a helmet again,1
9249,The repair job is stronger than the original,1
9250,Here are the photos:,1
9251,Little late now but I'm pretty sure they made it so you can take the magnet out in places with alot of iron dust,1
9252,Little late now but I'm pretty sure they made it so you can take the magnet out in places with alot of iron dust I broke the buckle trying to remove the magnet,1
9253,As mentioned above~ the buckle is fragile,1
9254,Does ANYONE like the magnet? Everyone I know hates it but it still won't die,1
9255,I’ve broken two buckles,1
9256,I love the helmet but the magnetic buckle is awful,1
9257,What problem are they trying to fix with this ridiculous design????,1
9258,Somewhere~ maybe in their advertising literature I read that they like the buckle because it self closes with mittens on,1
9259,Dumb idea for sure,1
9260,My fix leaves the buckle permanently threaded~ which was the standard in the early '80s before they invented snap buckles.,1
9261,When new and clean~ it might self close,1
9262,With a little iron dirt stuck to it~ it also self OPENS,1
9263,I have never had a helmet almost fall off mid-route but it happened twice on the same pitch with my Meteor since the buckle was too fouled to fully close and the helmet almost fell off when it glanced a roof,1
9264,Oh well~ if it is going to be dangerous and annoying~ at least the magnets add weight and cost...,1
9265,I would like to revive this thread in an attempt to shame Petzl into eliminating the magnets from their helmet buckles,1
9266,I recently broke the buckle on my Sirocco~ for the second time,1
9267,The magnets in both sides of the buckle attracted a tiny amount of grit~ despite my efforts to keep it clean,1
9268,The buckle doesn’t stay shut if the slightest amount of dirt is in the way,1
9269,Testing to see if it’s securely closed breaks it,1
9270,A helmet that won’t stay on your head is worse than no helmet,1
9271,Until the magnets are eliminated~ Petzl should make buckle replacements (of the male side) easily available at no charge,1
9272,And I forgot to mention that once the buckle wouldn’t close~ repeated attempts to clean the grit from the interfaces failed,1
9273,The magnets only allow displacing it temporarily.,1
9274,A year and a half later I'm still using the buckle fix shown at the start of this thread,1
9275,I still love that helmet~ lightest thing ever,1
9276,I suppose I should replace the entire helmet harness~ it's looking old and sweated out,1
9277,In the back of my mind I know that all the best climbers never wear helmets,1
9278,None of us wear them in the gyms~ at all,1
9279,So it's kind of a security blanket....sort of a teddy bear thing,1
9280,Still~ my climbing buddy Paul Bailey has been blind for 10 years now after taking a ledge fall and landing on his head without a helmet,1
9281,He crushed his optic nerve,1
9282,Helmets are good,1
9283,This is Paul~ before the accident:,1
9284,Hey Fritz — Good to see your voice,1
9285,I haven’t used the rope much,1
9286,Unless I need a 90~ I use shorter~ thicker~ older ropes,1
9287,It’s great to have for linking pitches when the belayer stays on the ground.,1
9288,That's a good fix~ but for $100+ helmet~ Petzl should damn well fix the problem themselves,1
9289,I just had a buddy lose his helmet part way up the Polish route on the Hulk because that stupid buckle self-released,1
9290,I'm a big fan of their gear in general~ but it's pathetic that Petzl hasn't addressed this.,1

9293,I'm a big fan of their gear in general~ but it's pathetic that Petzl hasn't addressed this,1
9294,iirc the buckle is designed to break and release so you can't hang yourself on it if it gets stuck,1
9295,I think this is a good feature,1
9296,I've also found the sirocco to be amazingly durable having climbed on the same one about every other weekend since 2013...,1
9297,iirc the buckle is designed to break and release so you can't hang yourself on it if it gets stuck,1
9298,I think this is a good feature,1
9299,I've also found the sirocco to be amazingly durable having climbed on the same one about every other weekend since 2013..,1
9300,Yeah~ because there’s been such a spate of buckle related self hangings with other helmets,1
9301,They had no choice~ really,1
9302,They had to stop the carnage,1
9303,Broke my buckle last year~ sent petzl an email ~ 4 days later I had a new buckle for free....,1
9304,Me too~ twice~ the first time after I insisted I didn’t need a whole new helmet and to just send me the buckle.,1
9305,Good to see you again! You were my favorite partner who was over let’s just say sexagenarian status,1
9306,I will be in Durango from Friday early morning until Sunday early morning and then departing northbound on the Colorado Trail with an estimated completion time of CTR of approximately six days,1
9307,Wish me luck!,1
9308,We sell a lot of Petzl helmets (I have a Sirocco 2) and I’ve never heard of this happening,1
9309,We’re the kind of store that people return things to for the smallest thing so I’m surprised we’ve not had anyone come back with this problem~ seeing that it’s quite common in the US,1
9310,Maybe we don’t have as much iron or metal in our dirt in the U.K,1
9311,or Europe? Sounds silly but I’m being serious,1
9312,It’s the only reason I can think of hat this is not an issue over here.,1
9313,I sent Petzl America an email and got a prompt response,1
9314,James Ruda sent me a male half without a magnet~ along with instructions for removing magnets,1
9315,Despite the great customer service~ I won’t buy another Petzl helmet unless the magnets are eliminated from the buckles,1
9316,Removing the magnets isn’t as easy as it looks,1
9317,George  - could you share the instructions for removing the magnet?,1
9318,I tried copying the link with my not-so-smart phone,1
9319,Didn’t succeed~ so I copied it by hand,1
9320,Hope it’s accurate,1
9321,Thanks!,1
9322,How long did you have to wait to get them back?,1
9323,I think it was 6 weeks,1
9324,I've been using a Superclip attached to a painters pole for years now,1
9325,They work pretty well~ and I've been happy with how long they last,1
9326,I like that it can be used to take draws down as well as put them up.The main limitation of the Superclip has little to do with the device itself,1
9327,It is limited by whatever pole you attach it to,1
9328,I have used both a 12' pole I got from Lowes and an 18' pole that I ordered off the Internet that actually came as a 30' pole (using all 30' is too heavy~ unsteady~ and ridiculous),1
9329,I recently got two Beta Sticks~ the Standard 12' model~ and the XL 18' model,1
9330,They are awesome,1
9331,First off~ I was concerned that the attachment mechanism wouldn't work with my draws:  It works great with the Wild Country Helium 2~ CAMP Photon Wire~ and CAMP Dyon,1
9332,While it will work with the current CAMP Nano 22~ it doesn't hold the gate open very far~ so it's more fiddly to get it clipped,1
9333,But the Superclip didn't work at all with the Nano 22,1
9334,There is velcro on the back side of the head with a slot in the plastic to slot and secure a toothbrush for brushing holds,1
9335,The biggest most awesome thing about it~ besides that it works~ is how compact it gets,1
9336,"The 18' XL model collapses to 3'10"" and it weighs 25 ounces",1
9337,"The 12' Standard model collapses to 2'9"" and weighs 18 ounces",1
9338,It can fit into many packs without much ado,1
9339,Three gripes:  1,1
9340,They are more wobbly at full extension than my painter poles~ especially the long one~ though it's not enough to be a deal breaker,1
9341,The carabiner attachment mechanism doesn't work with all carabiners~ though I imagine it should work with most biners one would use for sport climbing,1
9342,I don't see how it would work with something like a Petzl Ange,1
9343,I don't know how one would use the device to take a draw down,1
9344,This is something I can do with the Superclip without being too clever,1
9345,Trango distributes the Compact 9' and Standard 12' models in the US~ so those are the easiest to get here,1
9346,"Beta Stick also makes a Technical 8'9"" model that folds like an avalanche probe~ a Large 15' model~ and my XL 18' model",1
9347,But you currently have to order those from Europe,1
9348,I highly recommend the Standard over the Compact as a much more useful size of the two sold in the the US,1
9349,If there was a way to attach a Superclip to the pole of the Beta Stick~ it would be fantastic,1
9350,I ordered my Beta Sticks from Dick's Climbing in the UK (https://www.dicksclimbing.com/products/betastick),1
9351,It took 4 days to be delivered from the day I ordered.,1
9352,The beta stick is great,1
9353,A partner has one and it’s more he best I’ve used,1
9354,A painters pole is easier at full extension~ but the beta stick straps to the pack easier,1
9355,Also shines when you have to stick clip up a route,1
9356," Modifying a Beta Stick for a Superclip is pretty easy - buy a painter pole extension like this: https://store.mcguckin.com/inet/storefront/store.php?mode=showproductdetail&product=64772 cut about 2.5"" from a male end and drill a hole in the bottom of it~ sized to fit the smallest segment of the BS",1
9357,Remove the head from the BS (with a hacksaw~ or drill out the rivet) and epoxy the pole extension fragment onto the BS tip:  The old BS head can be mounted in a similar way with one of the joining collars~ allowing it to be attached to the modified BS:,1
9358,That’s great,1
9359,Will do and thanks,1
9360,Beta sticks were ubiquitous in the UK until recently,1
9361,As summarised above~ they are light and compact,1
9362,The biggest down-sides are the lack of durability that comes with this~ the pole is notorious for stopping working~ and the rather fussy head design,1
9363,Two alteratives:  The LACD is an avalanche probe type pole with a super clip type head,1
9364,Very compact~ quite light: https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/lacd-lacd-clipstick/  The ultimate big wall cheat stick?! The Pongoose~ which has a slightly beefier pole than the Beta and unique innovative head that’s very easy to clip or unclip with,1
9365,It also has a screw fitting that takes a camera or (bespoke) brush,1
9366,Downsides are cost~ weight (600g v 450g for the similar size Beta)~ and that it’s only available in one length (2.85m~ 9’4”),1
9367,It is clearly the best clipstick of all I have tried,1

9382,If anyone knows please share,1
9383,It's the only thing that I miss from the superclip,1
9384,I swore I had used the velcro strap like I was going to clip the rope to an empty draw~ but then just opened the gate~ cinched it tight then lifted it off,1
9385,I'll go try it in the garage and see if I can get it to work,1

9403,Duncan~ I'm curious~ how often does the rope slide off the gate and into the biner when retrieving a quickdraw? <edit>   At first~ when trying to unclip draws at the crag without pre-practice and having not recently checked the video~ quite often!  Now~ after a little practice~ hardly ever,1

9406,BetaStick Evo: Quickdraw Removal,1
9407,BetaStick Evo: Quickdraw Removal I have and love my BetaStick Evo but I've had very mixed success using this technique,1
9408,The problem is that the biner slips the gate clicks back shut,1
9409,I suspect a well-placed piece of friction tape on the side of the betastick head might help,1
9410,I just got the Kalias stick clip and really like it,1
9411,its a bit expensive at $40 but its basically a thicker tent-pole style folding stick,1
9412,It collapses down to where I can just stick it to the side of my bag and is less than half the weight of my last clip  https://www.kailasgear.com/stick-clip-quickdraw-not-included_p2524.html  Previous setup was a pool skimming net pole and a home-made wire https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QIXV1G/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It cost $12 to make and It worked great until I started on some long approaches and wanted something a little lighter,1
9413,The new kailas clip up is telescoping and about 9 for long,1
9414,I bought it with the pro deal code floating around,1
9415,Head is like the super clip but thinner so it’s easier to get the draw in and sometimes too easy for the draw to come out,1
9416,Feels s little delicate but time will tell,1
9417,I was putting around a goodwill and found an extendable golf-ball retriever for $5 (like this) that actually seems pretty viable as a cheaper alternative to these products,1
9418,The ball-cup holds the gate open~ and with a little tape added for friction will hold a carabiner stable,1
9419,I may end up cutting a notch to hold the gate snug as well,1
9420,Mine goes from 3-12 feet and weighs a few pounds~ but I bet you can find a wide variety of sizes,1
9421,(Edit: A quick search revealed that I wasn't the first to find this option...),1
9422,Just got my new beta stick evo~ but it doesn't seem to work with some of my older BD quick draws,1
9423,Seems that the wire retainer piece is just a little too short to latch the quickdraw gates open,1
9424,Anybody else have this issue?,1
9425,The wire catch can actually slide up and down in the slot on the Evo to change the angle of the retainer,1
9426,Move it UP in the slot and it should be able to reach your gates,1
9427,I had a similar issue and it took me a while to figure this out,1
9428,It was also with older BD straight gate draws,1
9429,Here is a pic~ I believe the wire retainer is as far up as it can go,1
9430,You can see that it hasn't quite latched yet.,1
9431,That's a fat carabiner,1
9432,What is that? I also had some solid~ straight gates that it didn't like to grab,1
9433,I bent the wires in a bit to just make it more grabby and it works now,1
9434,I have the exact same issue,1
9435,Any one have a fix?,1

9470,Any camping in RMNP requires a permit,1
9471,They can be acquired from the park authorities for a nominal cost~ but they are usually booked far into the future,1
9472,Lone Peak Cirque in the Wasatch Range ​And Good medicine wall in the Unitas are nice for multi day trips with nice climbing and camping,1
9473,People do both of these in single days also,1
9474,Wind River Range is a must,1
9475,Wham Ridge~ though plenty of people do it in a single day~,1
9476,Lone Eagle Peak in the Indian Peaks.,1
9477,Colony Lakes to access Crestone Peak/Needle area,1
9478,And Sky Pond /Lake of Glass to access Sharkstooth/Petit/Saber,1
9479,Both areas have great climbs and scenic camping,1
9480,I’m currently looking to add equipment to my rack and I’m seeing great deals on climbstuff.com,1
9481,However~ I’m looking for what other people’s experiences with them have been,1
9482,Are they legit? The website is pretty rudimentary so it just makes me question its legitimacy,1
9483,Thanks in advance,1
9484,Worked for me,1
9485,Surprise chalk and a buff was included in my order which was kinda fun,1
9486,They are really amazing,1
9487,Great customer service~ often great deals~ and they support local climbing areas,1
9488,What's not to love? Also~ you get a good discount for being an Access Fund member too~ so definitely look into that if you're a member.,1
9489,They're the climbing branch of treestuff.com an arborist shop,1
9490,My experience has been top notch~ plus they donate to local climbing groups!,1
9491,Worked for me as well,1
9492,They are great~ an item was backordered so they have me a nice coupon and the option to cancel or wait,1
9493,Great site,1
9494,I've had some orders come in from them in just one day with free shipping,1
9495,The website is a little basic but they are 100% legit,1
9496,Also they donate part of your order to climbing groups!,1
9497,Great company~ always gives free swag (nice glass~ sun buff~ etc.) One of the few companies I even consider paying full price for something,1
9498,Ordered a rope a couple of months ago,1
9499,It arrived before they said it would.,1
9500,We use them quite a bit~ always great service and prices,1
9501,I ordered a pair of shoes last Saturday and they arrived by Tuesday,1
9502,Also~ everything is 35% off sitewide.,1
9503,Enter code “SENDIT20” and you’ll like them even more!,1
9504,Great site! However~ with 35% off and items increasingly going out of stock without note that the item(s) will be re-ordered soon may mean going out of business?? I hope not~ because they have been an incredible company thus far!,1
9505,Looks like they are indeed going out of business :( 40% sale now,1
9506,My experience with them was highly positive,1
9507,They were quick with responses and helped me figure out an issue with my payment method in about a day,1
9508,My packagealso arrived a day early and came with a,1
9509,free buff! I will probably buy from the again,1
9510,Doubt it.,1
9511,I've had good experiences with them as well,1
9512,My first order included the free buff others have mentioned~ a free bag of chalk~ and a free pint glass,1
9513,Sucks if they're really going out of business.,1
9514,Just saw on their site:,1
9515,Really blows my mind,1
9516,I live in Indianapolis right by the warehouse and they were the best,1
9517,Let locals come in to pick up orders which made shoe purchases a breeze to say the least,1
9518,Super nice folks,1
9519,Finally started building my trad rack with a full set of BD stoppers and a nut tool,1
9520,They need a memorial page!,1
9521,TreeStuff is not changing as far as I know~ but yes~ ClimbStuff is closing down by the end of this month,1
9522,40% off is a good deal~ but total bummer they are closing up shop,1
9523,They did some good things,1
9524,Glad I read this just saved myself $40~ there looks to be a couple good deals left,1
9525,I'd recommend atleast looking.,1
9526,Hopefully you read the 2019 deals thread where you can stack ALLACCESS for 20% off the current sale/closeout prices~ also,1
9527,Hopefully you read the 2019 deals thread where you can stack ALLACCESS for 20% off the current sale/closeout prices~ also,1
9528,That I did not do.....,1
9529,I was just so excited,1
9530,Placed my first order with them on Sunday~ received on Wednesday in New Mexico from Indiana~ seamless experience for me:,1
9531,Got some shoes on sale Tuesday,1
9532,Got a rope today,1
9533,Saved almost $200 ~ crazy,1
9534,Going broke saving money here too!   ;),1
9535,I was an ambassador for them,1
9536,Definitely completely legit,1
9537,Just no returns as they're shutting down.,1
9538,People will try to sell anything on ebay,1
9539,Anyone for a wooden ice axe? Sorry I can’t link it but you know where to go,1
9540,Thought I’d seen  it all,1
9541,Anybody climbing on Trax rubber? I need to resole~ Yosemitebum now only offers Trax,1
9542,Also~ any experience with GearforRock~ out of the Ukraine?,1
9543,I got some gearforrock cams over ebay,1
9544,Inexpensive~ but kinda cheap looking in the materials dept,1
9545,No problems with them yet~ but none have held a big fall yet either,1
9546,I see they are spreading out with more strange looking knock-off stuff on ebay lately,1
9547,No idea who has Trax rubber though.,1
9548,I'm impressed,1
9549,Almost as good as fiveten.,1
9550,Yosemite Bum has been my go-to resoler for at least 5 years,1
9551,My experience has always been positive,1
9552,I like the Trax rubber that they use.,1
9553,Evol uses it,1
9554,It's pretty good~ no complaints,1
9555,It wears slowly~ and the friction is solid,1
9556,I wouldn't say it's as good as stealth or some of the other rubbers~ but you won't be super pissed if you get it,1
9557,It seems a little stiffer/harder which helps reduce the wear~ but I don't think that compromises the overall stickiness,1
9558,There's a couple threads over at RC.com about gear for rocks,1
9559,Some older ones then a more recent one how they recently (or supposedly) got certified,1
9560,Note some of the info may be a bit older..,1
9561,rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/fo…;search_string=gear4rocks;#2017335 rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/fo…;search_string=gear4rocks;#2209870 rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/fo…;post=2302886;page=1;sb=post_latest_reply;so=ASC;mh=25;,1
9562,yosemitebum does an awesome job and trax rubber is very good (not my favorite~ but up there),1
9563,the only problem is it takes a while (~3 weeks) to get them back,1
9564,if that isn't a problem & you like the rubber~ go for it,1
9565,my personal favorite if Komitos in Estes Park,1
9566,Steve does an incredible job and is pretty cheap too (i think i paid $28 last time for 5.10 onyx 1/2 soles) & turn around is a week in high season.,1
9567,Agree nobody beats Stevie K' boot works,1
9568,Plus he's classic historic to climbing in Estes too.,1
9569,Will Stevie do Evolv?  For some reason I thought I may have heard a rumor that only Yosemite Bum will do evolve shoes.,1
9570,Yosemite Bum will resole non-evolv shoes~ but it will cost a little more~ and of course they only use evolv rubber,1
9571,I think they can use different rubber if you send it in with your shoes~ but have never done this myself,1
9572,I've had good luck with them .,1
9573,mostly on my gym shoes,1
9574,Living in CA their shipping doesn't seem to take all that long~ especially in the off season.,1
9575,Yosemite Bum is Evolv,1
9576,They did a good job on my Pontas the last two times,1
9577,Quick turn around as well~ I'm from the East coast~ and it takes about two weeks to get them back,1
9578,Price is also very reasonable,1
9579,Just about any shop will do Evolv shoes~ but not with the trax rubber,1
9580,I was told yosemite bum is the only shop that do trax rubber~ but I don't know if that's still true or not.,1
9581,I use YosemiteBum for my resoles~ no complaints concerning the Trax rubber~ it works just fine~ even though initially I almost switched resolers when YB didn't offer Stealth anymore,1
9582,BUT they do exceptional work~ they's resoled multiple pairs of my Moccasyms and they always look new when I get them back and fit just as well as when I sent them,1
9583,Great resoles!,1
9584,Where can I purchase Trax rubber so I can resole my own shoes?,1
9585,Just to get multiple takes~ I despise Trax rubber,1
9586,Ask yourself a couple questions: Will I use these shoes in the gym on plastic holds?  Will I only use these as an outdoor shoe? If Yes to the first~ Trax will certainly disappoint,1
9587,If Yes to the second~ you probably wont notice that much,1
9588,Not sure why I've had trouble~ but Trax in the gym is an epic fail for me,1
9589,C4~ Vibram Edge are excellent on plastic AND rock~ Trax is not,1
9590,My experience is there is a moment of warning when C4~ and edge rubbers start to slip so you know you're coming off the wall,1
9591,Trax is either on or off~ with no warning~ they just simply blow,1
9592,That always made me climb worse~ not knowing if i was going to slip off a hold at any moment,1
9593,Just my 2c though~ some people think it's great~ obviously.,1
9594,I've gotten 6-8 resoles done with Trax rubber and have no complaints,1
9595,I climb primarily outdoors but do go to the gym often enough,1
9596,I like it because it seems to be a little longer lasting than some of the softer rubbers that I've tried,1
9597,Ma Ja~ harder rubbers do tend to be less forgiving if your footwork is off,1
9598,This is especially true on slick plastic holds (or slicker rock),1
9599,I'm not saying that it's your lack of experience~ but you may want to consider paying special attention to your precision~ which is a good thing to do regardless of rubber type,1
9600,I imagine that as you progress you will notice that the type of rubber on your shoes starts to matter less and less,1
9601,I see you climb in the Red,1
9602,My favorite place on the planet,1
9603,"I miss it even though I live in a national park 10 minutes from dozens of ""classic"" multi-pitch routes",1
9604,Have some fun there for me!,1
9605,I was impressed with YosemiteBum’s resole job,1
9606,They replaced the whole toe cap rather than just a portion of it on my blown out Tarantulaces,1
9607,I found them to be the most reasonably priced of the main resolers for shoes that need a toe cap as well,1
9608,Especially when you send in 3+ pairs and get free return shipping,1
9609,I plan to use them again the next time I resole,1
9610,Have they reformulated Grip2 since last fall when you were saying it was the worst on plastic?,1
9611,Have they reformulated Grip2 since last fall when you were saying it was the worst on plastic?,1
9612,I think Trax is great on real rock and in the gym,1
9613,I think this is somewhat body weight dependent but I find with Trax the rubber is stiff enough for me to edge but also pliable enough to smear when I need to (very common to have to do both of those moves on outdoor routes),1
9614,This of course is I think like all rubber choices slightly body/weight dependent,1
9615,I am tall/skinny and weigh about 170 so I find Trax is great for me,1
9616,A good analogy is if you weigh 250 you will likely hate c4 (very soft rubber) because your body weight will basically be folding it in half every time you try to push down,1
9617,As a general rule~ the more you weigh the stiffer a rubber you will want compared to a lighter climber because your weight effectively makes it softer,1
9618,My rough opinion of each rubber's stiffness - furthest left is softest~ furthest right is stiffest.Soft                                       Stiff C4                                         Onyx                 XS Grip 2                    XS Edge                       Trax,1
9619,I'll never say I dont need more experience~ but my technique is quite good~ I used that to cheat my way up routes and problems until my strength finally caught up,1
9620,I have always paid very close attention to my feet~ I can usually get 6+ months out of a pair of my hiangles that I exclusively wear in the gym,1
9621,I'm usually in 3-4 days depending if I get out 1 or 2 days on the weekend,1
9622,I've just always noticed how different rubber feels~ and those two mentioned just dont work for me,1
9623,Grip2 is actually as good or better than anything if you're standing on a volume or smearing on a textured wall~ but I couldn't stand on any slopey plastic holds~ and this is me swapping shoes and doing the same footwork with hiangles and having quick and easy success,1
9624,Just my experience,1
9625,And yeah~ the Red is my favorite style of climbing I've found so far,1
9626,Still haven't tried any Limestone though~ so still not sure it's the end of my search.,1
9627,What you’re describing is edge for me.,1
9628,What you’re describing is edge for me,1
9629,It must be a body weight thing~ as someone mentioned earlier.,1
9630,I guess...I’m usually between 185-200 and generally prefer C4 most of the time,1
9631,I think climbing style makes a difference too,1
9632,I love Miuras because they feel like cheating on small edges~ but I find my feet blow unexpectedly~ especially on plastic,1
9633,With Anasazis (C4) I have to generate more of the edging power from my feet but I also get more response and end up climbing better.,1
9634,In my anecdotal experience~ I had a pair of shoes I exclusively wore in the gym resoled with C4 and then with Evolv's new Trax SAS and I didn't experience any difference in performance between them,1
9635,Gotta say I really love Trax SAS and XE and don't feel any need to get my shoes resoled anywhere other than Yosemite Bum~ but I only wear Evolv's so I am used to the rubber.,1
9636,I didn't ask for your opinion on whether Trax is good or bad,1
9637,I asked where to buy it.,1
9638,I didn't ask for your opinion on whether Trax is good or bad,1
9639,I asked where to buy it,1
9640,And I gave my opinion~ whether you asked for it or not,1
9641,Now we're in a serious predicament.,1
9642,I didn't ask for your opinion on whether Trax is good or bad,1
9643,I asked where to buy it,1
9644,He was answering the question posted by the OP,1
9645,I didnt think that was a crime,1
9646,Came to say what has been said~ the rubber is excellent in cold weather and wet rock,1
9647,Hot slabs? Awful,1
9648,Did the test yesterday~ the Vibram kicked Trax' ass,1
9649,Came to say what has been said~ the rubber is excellent in cold weather and wet rock,1
9650,Hot slabs? Awful,1
9651,Did the test yesterday~ the Vibram kicked Trax' ass,1
9652,Yes XS edge is stiffer than Vibram therefore better in the summer on hot slabs.,1
9653,Full disclosure: I support Evolv exclusively and am selling my TCP's and Mocs to buy a larger pair of Gennies and Addicts,1
9654,No good replacement found yet for K-Laces~ though,1
9655,Yesterday I went trail running in the Generals down Guppy Gully in the White Mountain of the Colorado River,1
9656,You might appeciate our three-part~ 10~000' vertical foot review of POR LO GENERALLLLL,1
9657,TLDR is that Trax XE is stickier but less durable than XS Edge,1
9658,XS grip is silly sticky!,1
9659,Shoe and rubber don't matter nearly as much as some people think,1
9660,It's more about consistent footwork and technique,1
9661,I am able to climb equally poorly regardless of what shoe/rubber combination I'm using.,1
9662,What are your thoughts about these draws?,1
9663,Same as any other draw I’ve ever used,1
9664,These are the only BD draws I don't like since they snag,1
9665,I'd go for the Posiwire or Livewire if you prefer clipping wiregates.,1
9666,I have some and while they work OK~ not looking to get rid of them~ they do have a bit of a tendency to snag on the bolt hanger,1
9667,I second the rec for Posiwires,1
9668,I have some and they're my favorites.,1
9669,They were the cheapest draws at REI when I was starting to lead so I've got a dozen,1
9670,The stiff dogbone is great when a bolt is out of reach but they might be the heaviest wiregate draws you can buy,1
9671,If you're color coding your rack then I hope you like Halloween.,1
9672,Oh cool~ thanks! Im a beginner climber and I'm just starting to get into lead climbing,1
9673,I got a dozen last week for a total of $120 at backcountry,1
9674,Since I'm a newbie~ this should be sufficient for me~ right?,1
9675,If you’re using them for your anchors and most of what you climb is 10 bolts or less per pitch you’re fine,1
9676,I've never had an issue removing or having them snag,1
9677,Lots of miles on mine,1
9678,Get posiwires unless you really prefer completely wiregates,1
9679,Wiregates all day~ every day,1
9680," Fit: True to size Fabric: 98% cotton 2% spandex Durability: Exceptionally poor Price: $90 retail""Purpose-built to withstand scrapes~ falls~ and tears from brutally sharp rock~ the cotton/spandex Quarry fabric blend makes an ideal choice for the climber looking to balance light weight and strong performance."" Unfortunately none of the above is true",1
9681,After two weeks of owning the pants~ a few crag days~ and one trip the pants are falling apart,1
9682,The draw string is cheap,1
9683,The cinch in the ankles is cheap,1
9684,The fabric is far from durable,1
9685,I have punctures in the knees~ holes in the side pokets~ and holes in the seat,1
9686,Some of which began to form after the first day of use,1
9687,I would NOT recommend this product to anyone climbing outdoors,1
9688,They seem better suited for the gym,1
9689,I agree with OP's comments completely,1
9690,I've owned a pair of Quarry pants since February and they have proven to be a significant disappointment,1
9691,"In addition to the durability issues listed above~ I also find them to have an odd fit and limited mobility; the stretch is through the length of the pants and not very ""movement mirroring~"" as described on OR's website and the fit through the crotch is awkward - you feel like you're going to rip out the ass in the pants if you were to attempt a deep squat",1
9692,I've worn my pair predominantly while route setting/bouldering on a full-featured (very rough and textured) outdoor bouldering wall,1
9693,The Quarry's are definitely not a bouldering pant; high stepping and stemming in these pants feels extremely restricting,1
9694,The cotton/spandex fabric shows every abrasion and scuff~ and they're not very breathable when compared to other cotton-blend pants from Black Diamond or Prana,1
9695,Oh~ and they wrinkle like crazy,1
9696,A silly complaint~ but I try to purchase pants I can get away with wearing into the office and climbing in after heading straight to the gym,1
9697,With the Quarry pants~ you're having to fluff in the dryer two or three times or taking an iron to them if you don't want to look like a ragged mess,1
9698,If you're looking to purchase OR pants~ save some money and go with the Ferrosi pants over the Quarry,1
9699,I have a pair of the ferrosi pants and my experience is similar to yours with the quarry pants~ especially the comment about the cut,1
9700,Both my wife and my climbing partner said the pants look like they were cut for women,1
9701,Also the pockets are too shallow to be useful,1
9702,I wear them for panting and yard work~ they are not nice enough to wear climbing,1
9703,I am very disappointed,1

9707,I wear them for panting and yard work~ they are not nice enough to wear climbing,1
9708,I am very disappointed,1
9709,Do you own the previous generation Ferrosi? They updated the fit and pockets for Spring 2019,1
9710,The side pockets are cut deeper and actually hold a phone or items,1
9711,The back pockets no longer have a zipper which is a pretty stupid design decision,1
9712,But~ the overall fit has improved - I find the updated version to fit and look a lot better than the previous version,1
9713,Oh~ another odd design update: the hem drawstring is no longer a pull cord with a toggle~ it's now just a flaw elastic band that you have to knot to cinch down~ which is the same design on the Quarry pants,1
9714,It works~ but..,1
9715,it's not great,1
9716,I find that I roll up the cuffs rather than mess with the adjustable draw cords/bands.,1

9732,I guess that if you are a gear reviewer for a climbing mag you get better service,1
9733,:(.,1
9734,That's odd...I have had the exact opposite experience with OR customer service,1
9735,I have three pieces of Ferossi clothing (pants~ Wind jacket and convertibles)~ The draw string broke and I just sent them in and got a new pair,1
9736,I do wish the draw string was a little bit longer...,1
9737,Summary: great slipper~ especially for crack climbing,1
9738,Comfortable out of the box,1
9739,Only thing it doesn’t do is overhangs,1
9740,I just wore through my first pair of Stonelands (laced) and I think they are pretty durable,1
9741,They lasted through 7 months of mostly full time crack climbing (sandstone),1
9742,I ended up wearing holes over the pinky joint in the leather so I couldn't get them resoled...,1
9743,I really like them,1
9744,MOst of my issues with them had to do with the lacing~ so that's not really important to the slipper,1
9745,Also~ I was forced to use these when I was climbing overhanding limestone tufas and they performed reasonably well for everything other than heal hooks.,1
9746,I realize it's been 5 years since you posted but~ I'd appreciate your input on this thread~ if you don't mind and have something to share~ that is.https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/117275752/you-loved-your-510-stonelands,1
9747,PMd you,1
9748,Holy shit~ have you really not found the for-sale forum yet?,1
9749,Are these fixe or CCH?,1
9750,Sorry Marc thanks for letting me know,1
9751,How can I delete this entry Marc so it doesn’t cause any disruption.,1
9752,I've been searching for a new womens shoe to replace my pair of beginner climbing shoes,1
9753,I want something that is aggressive enough to make improvements but still comfortable enough to wear for 1 to 2 hours at the gym,1
9754,Any recommendations?,1
9755,womens la sportiva miura~ miura vs~ kataki~ or otaki all fill the not super aggressive~ but still somewhat aggressive shoe,1
9756,the miura and kataki have a laces~ whereas the miura vs and otaki have velcro~ also the otaki has some rubber on top of the toe for toe hooking additionally the scarpa arpia is made in mens and womens and is advertised as an intermediate or transitioning shoe from flat to aggressive,1
9757,Ignoring the fact that your shoes are not going to improve your technique~ you need to try on shoes and see what works for you,1
9758,Anything slightly downturned fits the semi-aggressive profile~ and everyone makes something in that category,1
9759,I like 5.10 and vibram rubber~ other friends prefer other options,1
9760,Tenayas just fit for me~ while a friend can never get a pair to work for his foot.,1
9761,For my second pair of climbing shoes (first pair of aggressive ones) I got the la sportiva skwamas and they're great,1
9762,I could probably downsize them another half size but right now I can keep them on for almost my whole gym session taking them off every once in a while,1
9763,Definitely worth checking out in my opinion,1
9764,Thanks for the suggestions~ now I have a better idea of what to try on,1
9765,I realize that improving technique is not all about shoes~ but my beginner shoes have stretched out over time and it will give me more confidence to have a more moderate shoe,1
9766,That is a different issue,1
9767,Did the shoes stretch out,1
9768,or did you get shoes too large to begin with that then just broke in?  Leather uppers will stretch a bit~ while synthetics don't~ so keep that in mind when you size them,1
9769,Lace-ups let you customize the feel around your foot a bit more~ while velcro closures are easier to put on and take off (generally),1
9770," I am still going to say that most companies make a decent boot~ and how it fits your foot is most important~ so there is no one ""best.""  If you have a local shop with a decent supply~ talk to them about what you don't like in your existing shoe and see what feels best on your foot.",1
9771," Best price by far too!  I had some done last fall and when I used the cams for the first time~ I asked myself ""Who's brand new mastercam is this?"" They come back so new looking~ it totally threw me off until I realized it was my reslung one",1
9772,One more testimonial for Metolious's resling service-- high quality~ an excellent value~ and the best cleaning my cams had ever received.,1
9773,Metolius! Let others follow your example,1
9774,Well done,1
9775,Great to hear such good reviews! Can anyone speak to how they compare to MountainTools or runout customs in terms of quality? Would Metolius clean and resling cams from other companies?  Apologies for the noob questions: new to the reslinging world.,1
9776,I can't speak to the first question as I haven't gotten stuff reslung from all three companies~ but I'm fairly certain that Metolius only reslings Metolius cams.,1
9777,Metolius are a fantastic group of folks,1
9778,I bought a set of used Metolius cams that needed slings and they looked somewhat ugly - so the price was super low,1
9779,The teeth on the cams looked good~ as if they had not been placed a lot though,1
9780,Sent them into Metolius and they literally came back looking almost new,1
9781,Which was a good thing as I gave them to my son for Christmas,1
9782,Not just new slings~ but Metolius cleaned them so the metal was shiny and newer looking,1
9783,Big props to Metolius~ and that's correct~ (or it was then) they only resling Metolius cams,1
9784,I have also used Caccia equipment llc (cacciaequipment@gmail.com) and they kicked ass,1
9785,I believe Fish and Luke at Runout Customs also do reslinging if you are looking around~ check with them as well.,1
9786,Metolious has been awesome,1
9787,They fixed 2 of my cams where the trigger wires were fraying AND even sent me an offset mastercam replacement~ no charge~ after mine got jacked up taking a lead fall,1
9788,They just wanted to see a picture to see if it was fixable which they decided it wasn't.,1
9789,Agreed,1
9790,I used to cringe looking at the old Metolius cams on my rack and reach to something else,1
9791,They replaced the slings~ shined em up~ they're still doing great,1
9792,Thank you Metolius~ for making a product you stand behind~ and offering great lifetime service to your loyal customers.,1
9793,Yet another up vote for Metolius~ they re-slung my old cams from 2K and they came back looking more new than I could have imagined,1
9794,It was almost magical,1
9795,VERY affordable~ spectacular work..,1
9796,agreed~ simply the BEST service!!! and they will decide if your wires need replacing,1
9797,What is NOT to love???,1
9798,And another - 10/10 service when I sent my Met cams in~ including replacing an offset cam because they didn't like something about what they saw,1
9799,I hadn't asked for the replacement and it was never discussed~ they just did it and sent it back with the others they'd reslung,1
9800,My only problem: I don't really like Metolius cams compared to BDs and Aliens..,1
9801,Still though~ best customer service in the game,1
9802,BD isn't far behind~ but no one matches Metolius in that dept.,1
9803,Thanks for the info~ I've been wondering about Tenaya shoes for a while,1
9804,Any thoughts on how they fit compared to other shoes/brands? I'm specifically interested in how the Ra's compare to Scarpa Vapor V's~ if you have used that shoe,1
9805,Thanks again!,1
9806,Thanks for posting Mono!!   I've been looking at getting a pair of Tenaya shoes and this information sealed the deal,1
9807,Excited to see some new shoes on the market!,1
9808,Damn,1
9809,Sounds like they don't make shoes for those who crush 5.7.,1
9810,The Tenaya brand had a good reception at Outdoor Retailer in August~ although I worry that~ like many other Euro shoe brands~ they face an uphill battle in the states in a very saturated and entrenched market,1
9811,Good effort on the write-up~ hopefully Tenaya will gain traction in the US and folks will start asking their local retailer to carry them.,1
9812,Wow~ that was the most exhaustive shoe review I have seen in a while~ thanks,1
9813,Trango's willingness to do one free mail exchange is huge,1
9814,It sounds like I will never see these in a local retail shop~ so it's  a no risk chance to try new shoes,1
9815,It seems to be really hard to find places that consistently carry a reasonable selection of shoes,1
9816,They all carry the beginner shoes but that's sort of it,1
9817,Conclusion..,1
9818,everyone buys their shoes on the internet now?   Killer for me though might be the material,1
9819,As a guy with sweaty feet~ those micro fiber ones (evolvs in my case) got wet and clammy real fast,1
9820,Looks like I'm stuck with leather models.,1
9821,great review,1
9822,Thanks for the great review.,1
9823,Where is the like button on this website?  I'm looking forward to picking up a pair soon.,1
9824,Mono - Any chance these guys wanna hook up a pair or two for a CT climber? I will gladly review them and if they're good talk them up locally for a pair or two as well!!!,1
9825,Thanks for the great review Mono! I may have to take my best guess at the right size & order some.,1
9826,If you want to know more about the Masai,1
9827,Here's my two cents .,1
9828,Bought a pair of Ra's~ and without going into much detail~ they are the best shoes i've ever worn,1
9829,I was a huge anasazi velcro fan~ and love a good 5.10 heelcup~ these are more comfortable while also being tighter fitting~ than any shoe i've ever worn,1
9830,They are just right in the stiffness and downturn levels as well,1
9831,Usually working a hard route i can't wait to finish lowering before i want to take my shoes off~  these i barely notice are there,1
9832,GO Get These Shoes.,1
9833,the real problem is being able to try these on ..,1
9834,sure theyll ship you 2 pairs and you can send one back~ but what if neither of em fits ..,1
9835,or you might need a 1/2 size up or down ..,1
9836,things you cant do without having em in a shop ..,1
9837,perhaps they can partner through zappos ...,1
9838,for those in the Vegas area~ DRS now has stock of the Masai and Ra...,1
9839,Which of these four shoes would be best for long trad routes and technical crack climbing?,1
9840,all killer,1
9841,I wear about a 8.5/9 in 5.10 anasazis,1
9842,What size are you going with for tenaya?  you seem to have a simialr foot size so figured id ask since ive no chance to try these on anywhere out here.,1
9843,I had a pair of Tenayas years and years ago that I picked up from the Barrabes website,1
9844,Overall it was a decent shoe (I don't think they make that model anymore) fit was similar to an old Anasazi velcro,1
9845,Nothing bad to say about em just didn't fit as well as other shoes~ same reason I don't wear 5.10's.,1
9846,I keep telling myself im going to buy a pair just havent got to it yet,1
9847,Not being able to try them on anywhere has been kinda deterring me,1
9848,Really dont feel like buying the wrong size and having to deal with returns and exchanges.,1
9849,+1 for fitting like a sock and being an extremely well made shoe,1
9850,If any of you are ever in Chattanooga visit Four Bridges Outdoors and try some on~ they're the only retailer I know of any where close,1
9851,Its either an 8.5 or a 9,1
9852,I just need to get it right the first time!,1
9853,Yo smarty pants or anyone in Vegas check out these shoes at Desert Rock Sports! I might even help you put them on,1
9854,now available on backcountry.,1
9855,I'm looking for an all day trad shoe,1
9856,What size should I look at~ street size +/-? Is the Masai pretty stiff???,1
9857,Hey Sweagan - the Masai is pretty stiff and would be a good choice,1
9858,Its has a relatively narrow and low volume fit,1
9859,I wear a size that is pretty similar to 5.10 mocs if that helps,1
9860,The Ra is another good option - i like the velcro for stretching the toes at belays (the Ra also fits my foot shape a little better),1
9861,I've been using the Ra's for a few months now and I absolutely love them!  I had been using the Muira's for several years but the Ra's are more comfortable and outperform the Muira's,1
9862,I use them for everything from long multipitch routes to single pitch projects.,1
9863,I bought some Tatankas,1
9864,Will let know how they go.,1
9865,How do you guys like the heel in these?  What would you compare them to?  I find that most shoes fit me very tight on the Achilles and annoyingly loose and baggy everywhere else around my heel,1
9866,I'm particularly interested in the Masai.,1
9867,Hey Larry~ the heels are relatively low volume~ meaning they don't have to cut back in so aggressively at the top~ so they might be a good fit,1
9868,As long as your foot isn't really wide the Masai would probably work well,1
9869,Some of the online retailers will exchange until you are happy,1
9870,I searched for the Masai on backcountry and found them,1
9871,The BC folks have always taken good care of me with exchanges and such,1
9872,But if a local dealer has them already~ that would be even better.,1
9873,Thanks~ Adam,1
9874,Anyone know of any retailers in the northeast with these or who might have them come spring?  I'd really like to try them on.,1
9875,My mocs are for the creek~ too~ but definitely tighter than average creek-shoes,1
9876,I haven't owned many 5.10s~ so I can't speak about the conversion too well,1
9877,"I have a 9.5 Ra that is a good ""long-but-still-kinda-hard-route"" type comfort/performance fit~ and my Sportiva approach shoes are 11",1
9878,If i wanted super comfort~ I could go to a 10~ but I prefer a tighter shoe,1
9879,(for reference~ my foot will physically fit into an 8),1
9880,I wear a a 9 in 5.10 anazasi and in the moc,1
9881,I got the masai's in a 9 and the fit is good imo,1
9882,tight but not painful with some break-in will be perfect,1
9883,I went with an 8.5 in the tatankas,1
9884,street shoe is a 10.,1
9885,Jason~  Based on those criteria~ I would recommend the Tenaya Ra,1
9886,Its wider than the Masai~ but still perfect for multi-pitch trad climbing,1
9887," They're a great ""all-around"" shoe~ but still perfectly capable of edging on really tiny holds",1
9888,I've worn mine all day while trad climbing with very little discomfort.,1
9889,Can somebody explain the difference between the inti and the ra? They look very similar~ is one softer or something?,1
9890,Big news!  I just got word that Tenayas are now available for purchase at Bentgate in Golden~ CO!  If you're on the Frontrange~ this is your big chance to try them in person,1
9891,Even better news~ Tenaya is hosting two shoe demos on the Front Range,1
9892,The first will be at the Boulder Rock Club on Wednesday 3/13~ at 5pm~ and the second at Miramont in Fort Collins on Thursday 4/18  at 5pm.,1
9893,I contacted trango thru their webpage with some general questions on the masai and sizing,1
9894,I had a nice exchange going with Adam (he's the guy in the videos describing the shoes on their website) about what shoes i have right now and what size i wear in them~ what i don't like about them~ etc..,1
9895,If you have specific questions~ i wouldn't hesitate to contact them~ they were very helpful,1
9896,I ended up ordering a pair of Masai's~ I'm expecting them to arrive next week~ I'll post up my thoughts after i get some miles on them.,1
9897,Tomorrow night!  Get psyched!   Wednesday March 13th 5-9pm t the BRC!,1
9898,I promised a review on the masai too~ but haven't been able to climb in the pair i got yet,1
9899,I've got some Achilles heel bursitis going on and can't even really get the shoes on,1
9900,The toebox is low volume~ an reminds me of the evovl Pontas: Flat~ Narrow and pointed,1
9901,The heel is low up the back~ lower on the Achilles than any other shoe I own,1
9902,The arch is high~ possibly too high as it makes the shoe sag under my heel (and hit precisely where my bursitis is),1
9903,Shoe Demo Thursday~ April 18 in Fort Collins!  Tell your friends!  Shoe Demo!,1
9904,I went deep water soloing in Thailand with my Tatankas and they recovered perfectly,1
9905,I think they may even fit better now (could just be in my head),1
9906,I love them on the southern sandstone,1
9907,I really like this shoe for vertical sport routes,1
9908,I wear a full size bigger in the Tatankas 42 1/2 than my Miuras 41 1/2,1
9909,This shoe has proven it's durability to me and i would recommend trying them out.,1
9910,You guys have almost convinced me~ I think my next pair of shoes may very well be a pair of Tenayas.,1
9911,killing you should try the tatankas as well,1
9912,I really liked the ras but i like the tatankas even more.,1
9913,ah~ freak,1
9914,I can't stand the anasazi at all! I'm gonna see if I can test out a pair of them.,1
9915,Jason~   I have really wide feet and the Ra's fit me great without pain or excess pressure,1
9916,My street shoe size is 9.5 and I am using 8.5 Ra's,1
9917,They are comfortable enough for long routes but I do tend to take them off at belays if possible,1
9918,I use the same shoe for one pitch routes that I'm projecting.,1
9919,well~ i figure it is about time i chip in my .02...,1
9920,i bought a pair of intis several months ago,1
9921,i primarily bought them to be a comfortable pair of warmup shoes,1
9922,my 5.10 galileos are my go-to shoes for really thin edging and/or hard face climbing,1
9923,i have a pair of not-so-tight galileos for warm ups~ but they are still fairly uncomfortable,1
9924,i tried on a couple sizes of the intis at the bent gate in golden,1
9925,i bought my pair a half size larger than the tightest i could wear,1
9926,they felt pretty comfortable,1
9927,i figured i would use them for routes up to 11a or so,1
9928,first day out~ i put them on and head up a smooth 5.8 granite route,1
9929,right off the bat i was like~ whoa~ what the hell,1
9930,they were not what i was expecting,1
9931,i was sort of expecting a toyota corolla~ and they felt more like a 911,1
9932,the grip on the rock was literally almost making my feet stumble,1
9933,it was pretty wierd,1
9934,i was impressed,1
9935,so i did a few more routes and started pushing them a bit,1
9936,damn! i was really surprised,1
9937,the rubber was excellent~ with great smearing ability,1
9938,they also edged well~ despite not being super tight or super stiff,1
9939,they felt reall 'accurate' for lack of a better word(?),1
9940,previously 5.12 was the domain of my galileos,1
9941,the intis have pretty much taken over,1
9942,i think i have only switched over to my galileos on a couple really heinous edging routes since i bought them,1
9943,the thing that impresses me the most is how well they perform while being so comfortable,1
9944,with my tight galileos~ i have literally 3 or 4 pitches per day in them before my toes are fried,1
9945,a lot of times i have to ice my toes that night so that i can climb the folowing day,1
9946,i have had many days with 10 to 15 pitches in my intis~ most of these days climbing a lot of routes with really demanding face climbing,1
9947,these things have completely and utterly defied my expectations.,1
9948,How is the sizing on the Masai? I'm a 10.5 street shoe~ US 9 / euro 42 in la sportiva.,1
9949,Call me a skeptic but I remain unconvinced (and in all fairness~ probably will be until I try a pair myself),1
9950,I've never found Anasazi/Galileo~ or really~ any Five Ten shoe to be particularly impressive,1
9951,In the Sportiva/Scarpa camp~ I'm not a diehard fan of Katana Velcro or Vapor Lace/V,1
9952,The Katana velcro isn't a bad crack jamming shoe~ but I still have a couple old pairs of Vipers that are better for that purpose (& really~ if I can comfortably foot jam a crack~ it probably isn't that hard~ so who cares how well the shoes perform?) If sized for edging~ they are like the Muira lace: they work well until the shoes are fully broken in: by then the last has softened quite a bit for hard edging,1
9953,The Vapor (both lace & velcro)~ IMO~ has too much toe box volume to size somewhat comfortably & still edge well (the last~ though holds up better than Katana velcro~ also softens & looses its aggressiveness fairly quickly),1
9954,So~ who has compared the Tenaya models against the likes of TC Pro~ Katana Lace~ Muira Velcro~ Solution~ Boostic~ Instinct VS~ Mago? It's not that I don't climb in other shoes~ but these are about the only models I'm willing to pay top dollars for,1
9955,And without a way of getting the Tenaya models for more than 20% off + tax (problem of a small distribution network)~ they need to be on par or better than these Sportiva/Scarpa models for me to consider trying.,1
9956,How does the Ra~ Inti~ Masai compare to Katana Lace and Vapor V (I have both)?  To me~ the Vapor V is a little less precise than the Katana Lace,1
9957,Other than that I found them somewhat similar in fit~ feel~ stiffness~ and performance,1
9958,Of course~ right now my KL with C4 sticks to everything a bit better than my VV with Mystique~ and softer too,1
9959,It was a closer match when the VV had XS Grip 2.,1
9960,the inti is kind of hard to describe,1
9961,when you try it on in the store~ it doesn't have that slightly downturned dagger sort of feel to it,1
9962,it really just feels like an ordinary comfortable shoe,1
9963,i think that is one of the reasons i was so surprised with how well it climbs.,1
9964,Not so easy for me try a pair out in the store here on the East Coast,1
9965,For a test drive~ I will have to order a pair online,1
9966,That is why I am asking before parting with $100,1
9967,Is this so unreasonable?     How about a shoe demo out East~ Monomaniac?,1
9968,Hmm~ I'm not sure I'd call these a Spanish delicacy,1
9969,Clearly I have had a different experience than most here so I figured I would post up my thoughts   For reference I almost exclusively sport climb on limestone~ my current go to shoe is the Miura VS~ and I also use sportiva Cobras and Miura lace-ups   I bought a pair of Inti's last fall after trying them on in the store and thinking they were very comfortable for how snug they were,1
9970,I wanted the Ra's (because of the cooler colors)~ but they were out and the salesman said the Inti was the slightly more narrow version which probably would fit my foot better anyway,1
9971,"Since then they have gone from my primary shoe~ to a warm-up shoe~ to a gym-only shoe~ to an ""in the gearbox at home"" shoe",1
9972,I have tried them on vertical techy routes and very steep routes of different styles and found them to perform poorly on all,1
9973,Part of the issue is that I think the shape of the shoe and the focal point of pressure are quite different from the sportivas,1
9974,It's hard to explain but I felt like the toe was more toward the center~ and when I weighted the foot I had the feeling that it was rolling out of the placement,1
9975,They are much softer than expected~ so I was never as confident standing on small edges as in the miuras,1
9976,They didn't feel as sensitive or as sticky as cobras,1
9977,Worst was steep face climbing where I felt I might as well just campus because I had no confidence toeing-in on pockets or edges,1
9978,Having said that~ I am interested in seeing how their new model performs,1
9979,In the mean time I will be sticking to my sportivas,1
9980,slim~ I feel like you keep getting in the crossfire between killis & me,1
9981,I knew killis was responding to me even before he explicitly called me out & I over-sprayed w/ my words when replying in a bad mood,1
9982,Unless the shoes fits you better than anything else~ I don't believe a plain climbing shoe design would work magic; maybe there's something more subtle going on than meets the eye (ex: Katana lace looks less aggressive than Miura lace out of the box but retains its shape much better),1
9983,Regardless~ I'll go try on a pair when I'm back in the front range~ just out of curiosity than anything else,1
9984,As with the whole rubber thing~ I'm mostly in agreement w/ your observation (although comparing rubber on different shoes are problematic & rubber that seems good on a brand new pair of shoes may quickly prove to be too soft once the sole gets softer),1
9985,As for Edge~ I couldn't wait for the rubber to wear off on my Katana lace to resole w/ Onyx,1
9986,All else were not equal~ but I can definitely tell the difference between my 2 Moonlight trips 4 months apart,1
9987,Still~ I do know a few people who like the Edge better & if you have to climb on warm/hot rock~ I do believe it edges significantly better than Onyx,1
9988,My experience w the old Grip was that chunks of it likes to come off @ Vedauwoo whereas the similarly soft C4 would leave more of a smeary mess,1
9989,But then I sent my hardest on a new pair~ old stock Mago with the Grip rubber.,1
9990,Hey guys!   I was fortunate enough to demo a pair of the Ra's this weekend at the AAC Cragging Classic in North Conway~ NH,1
9991,I spent the better part of the morning and afternoon testing them out on NH granite from the slabs on Whitehorse to some of the steeper routes here in the valley,1
9992,I found them to be pretty comfortable..a bit narrower in the toebox as I am used to the Scarpa instincts (plenty of room for my wide forefoot and narrow ankle,1
9993,I did feel a bit of a pressure point in the heel after the third or fourth pitch on Whitehorse..however..hanging belays on slab will tend to do this,1
9994,This is where the beauty of the Velcro strap comes into play,1
9995,A quick pull of the tabs and the shoes loosened and problem solved,1
9996,They performed quite well on the slabs~ I am a fan of xs grip rubber and found it to be more than sufficient on the bulletproof granite we have here in northern New Hampshire,1
9997,The shoes are quite a bit softer than the Anasazi VS and so I was a bit leary to switch to both inside and outside edges on steeper terrain as they felt a bit more like a slipper,1
9998,That being said~ they held an edge quite nicely but did lack the support that a stiffer shoe like the miura vs or Katana,1
9999,I did not send these into cracks or pockets so can't report back on that,1
