0,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,0," Hi all~ I am in the market for a new plaquette style device. I currently have a Reverso 4~ but I am contemplating between a Pivot~ ATC Guide~ or Reverso. I know they all operate essentially the same. When updateing my device~ I am looking for the device that has the least friction when bringing up a second in ""Guide Mode"". I already have a GIGI that I carry on longer routes~ but would like a single device that is easiest on my elbows when climbing shorter multipitch routes. What are everyone's thoughts with regards to this?",Sep 2017,Jun 19 2020,0
1,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,1, Easiest on the elbows would definitely be a Grigri. I carry one in addition to the plaquette on short multi pitch routes (and some long ones too).  Otherwise~ anything besides the Reverso. I've found it to have mucho drag. Make sure that you dedicate a nice round stock carabiner as the blocker too...,May 2006,Jun 19 2020,1
2,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,2, DMM Pivot,Mar 2019,Jun 19 2020,4
3,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,3, Both the Pivot and the ATC guide accept ropes to 11mm according to their spec sheets.  Some people claim the rotation of the Pivot makes it easier to pull in rope in guide mode~ but I haven't tried one so I can't speak to that personally.  I agree with Mike that the blocking carabiner matters and a grigri is best for single followers.  I use the grigri more than anything else because of the ease of hauling~ lowering~ and lack of elbow pain.  I have a preference for the ATC-guide because I like the orientation on my belay loop if using it for ascending (when that rare occurrence happens) and it's cheaper for me than the Pivot.   What's keeping you from using the GIGI for shorter climbs?  It's not good for lead belaying~ but you can just give it to the leader for every pitch.  ,Jun 2015,Jun 19 2020,0
4,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,4," Thanks Adam! As a clarification~ When climbing most multipitch routes our party generally tends to carry one Gigi and one GriGri and switch at each belay. Where I currently am~ most the multipitch routes are about 3 pitches in length. On these I like to just carry my ""Guide"" device to keep things less cluttered and simple~ plus it is the most versitile belay device overall. I understand the added benefits of lowering with a Pivot~ and the orientation difference with the ATC Guide. I've considered this~ and I am basically just looking for the ranking of least friction to most friction when belaying from the top with those 3 devices. I hope this helps clarify my original question. Thanks!",Sep 2017,Jun 19 2020,0
5,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,5, Right on~ Chris.  In that case~ the Pivot is probably your best bet.  ,Jun 2015,Jun 19 2020,1
6,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,6, grigri,Sep 2010,Jun 19 2020,0
7,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,7, To be fair~ a Gigi adds very little weight or bulk~ and it is still easier to pull slack through than any tube style plaquette.,Aug 2011,Jun 19 2020,0
8,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,8, I cannot speak from direct experience~ but I believe that the Mammut Bionic has the lowest friction in guide mode of any tube style device on the market.  If maximum versatility is what you are looking for~ I would check out the the Gigajul.    ... but I honestly think the Gigi/Grigri is the best setup for short multi-pitch climbs with single ropes.  ,Aug 2013,Jun 19 2020,0
9,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,9, Hey Karl~ Thanks for your reply. I have tried out the GigaJul thinking it would provide the most versatility. While I still believe it could theoretically be the most versatile~ I there just seems to be way to much drag when belaying with this is any form (toprope~ lead~ or from above). In my experience~ unless you are using ropes smaller than about 9.2~ it is just a pain. But again~ thanks for your input. I have not looked at the Mammut Bionic~ that may be work checking out.,Sep 2017,Jun 19 2020,0
10,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,10, If you liked the Gigajul~ except for the relatively high friction in guide mode~ you might also want to check out the Mammut Alpine Smart.  It is a bit bulky for my taste~ but guide mode is much lower friction.  ,Aug 2013,Jun 19 2020,1
11,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,11, did you try the gigajul or megajul? i've had both and the gigajul is much better for friction. my favorite tuber,Sep 2016,Jun 19 2020,0
12,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,12, This chart is a bit dated. It comes from an old article on Www.cascadeclimbers.com But~ it is at least a starting point for discussion.,Aug 2008,Jun 19 2020,5

14,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,14, Marty~ That is an interesting chart. This is essentially the data I am looking for. I wonder if there are any updated or newer more comprehensive versions of this. Thanks!,Sep 2017,Jun 20 2020,0

16,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,16,  Ovo or Gigi.  Weighs nothing~ easy pull.  You could literally put it in your pocket.,Nov 2015,Jul 4 2020,0
17,Plaquette/Guide Style Device,1,17, I've used a few of the other devices mentioned--namely the gigajul and pivot--and like them a lot for certain uses~ but my favorite guide-style device for multipitch is still the Bionic Alpine from Mammut. No fancy assisted-braking features (other than guide-mode)~ but it feeds and takes in <10mm ropes like a dream. It's also a lot more durable than full aluminum tubers like the pivot or reverso due to the use of steel for the rope-bearing surfaces.  If your main rope is >9.5ish~ the Bionic and ATC guide are going to feed better than the pivot~ reverso~ gigajul~ IMO. The latter two are better suited for slimmer singles or halves/twins. ,Apr 2015,Jul 5 2020,0
18,Up Mocc questions,1,0, Does anyone have experience with the Up Mocc from Unparallel Sports? I used to love Moccasyms because they worked great for my wide feet. I recently purchased a new pair~ and they were so narrow~ I couldn't get my foot into my normal size.  How do the Up Moccs size compared to the Moccasym? I typically would buy a 9.5~ which would be a quite tight sport shoe for a couple months~ and then would stretch out to gradually become something I could wear all day.  Thanks!,Jan 2013,Jun 17 2020,0
19,Up Mocc questions,1,1," I got them because the mocs aren't what they use to be. I'm 13 street shoe~ mocs 11.5. I purchased the up moc in 11.5. (Worn this shoe for 10+ years now). They are sized the same. However~  the up moc is ""thicker"" and slightly more aggressive. So its a tighter fit.  If I purchased another up moc I'd Still get an 11.5 I guess. But they still haven't broken in as much as the syms. ",Jun 2013,Jun 17 2020,1
20,Up Mocc questions,1,2, UpMocc wont stretch as much as the 5.10 mocc,May 2017,Jun 17 2020,1
21,Up Mocc questions,1,3, The up mocc does not stretch much at all~ I size the same as 5.10 mocc.  I have a few pairs~ 1 on its 3rd sole and they still fit tight. Normal moccs never last me this long~ they fall apart. ,May 2017,Jun 19 2020,3
22,Up Mocc questions,1,4, Very helpful. Thanks all. ,Jan 2013,Jun 21 2020,0
23,Up Mocc questions,1,5, I picked up the UP Moccs a couple months ago for the same reasons you describe. Absolutely love them. I got the same size that I used to wear in the older Moccasyms and they fit perfectly~ though--as others have said--they don't stretch nearly as much. Stickier than the five tens (IMO)~ and they have the best heel of any slipper I've tried. Just a heads-up: the reinforced pull-tab on the top initially caused a weird pressure point for me~ but it softened up after a couple of uses. ,Apr 2015,Jul 5 2020,1
24,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,0, Arc'Teryx's warranty is useless. I own a lot of Arc'Teryx products that I've accumulated over many years. I also own gear from other makers such as Patagonia and Outdoor Research. I've submitted claims to Patagonia with no problem. Send it in~ get it back repaired~ simple~ no hassle. I recently had an issue with Arc'Teryx shorts. While they're about 10 years old~ I only wore them occasionally~ casually and on a few day hikes; nothing harsh. They were washed in cold water and hang-dried. A couple weeks ago~ I pulled them out of my closet to discover the welded pockets were failing. I contacted Arc'Teryx and they demanded a proof-of-purchase before repairing. seriously? Who keeps receipts beyond a year or two? Patagonia and OR make no such requirement and such is not stated on Arc'Teryx tags. I will NEVER again buy anything Arc'Teryx. Their warranty is meaningless.,Jun 2020,Jul 3 2020,1
25,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,1, I’ve heard that sometimes it can really depend on the Customer Service Rep you get.  For a counter-example~ I broke the zipper divider on one of my Arc jackets last year.  Sent them a picture~ and they sent me a new one right away.  Point is~ it’s not meaningless...,Apr 2020,Jul 4 2020,4
26,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,2, I have noticed a general theme as well. Patagonia and OR seem to stand behind their stuff in ways that I find remarkable and loyalty-inspiring. Arc’teryx seems to try to weasel out of their version of doing the same 1/2 the time~ and repair well and easily~ if not graciously~ the other 1/2. So~ my perspective is that it’s not meaningless warranty~ but that I do not depend on it. I still buy their stuff when I like it best~ but unless it’s a clear favorite I skew towards other brands.,Dec 2015,Jul 4 2020,0
27,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,3, They recently repaired a zipper for me~ no questions asked. I dropped it off at an Arcteryx store which may have worked in my favor. Glad they didn’t ask for proof of purchase since I bought it used on MP.,Jun 2016,Jul 4 2020,1
28,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,4, I've had Outdoor Research and Mountain Hardwear step up in big ways in the last year or so.  Both times I returned items saying I was happy to pay for a repair as they were 5ish years old and had seen considerable use.  In the spirit of not tossing otherwise functional gear I wanted it repaired as professionally as possible and was more than ok with paying for it.  Both companies replaced expensive items even when I offered to pay a pro deal price at a minimum as I didn't consider it warrantied gear failure. ,Jul 2013,Jul 4 2020,0
29,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,5, Demanding a repair on 10 year old SHORTS?? Come on man - don't be like this. Arcteryx makes some quality stuff. ,Apr 2020,Jul 4 2020,23
30,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,6, I’ve never had a problem with their warranty. I had some stitching pull on a glove I bought at 50% off. They determined it to be a manufacturing defect and gave me a full priced credit~ which I promptly put back into a killer pair of Arc gloves. The whole process was seamless for me.,Dec 2016,Jul 4 2020,0
31,Arc'Teryx warranty is meaningless,1,7," Here's their warranty for clothing.

38,Unparallel Newtro,1,0, Any reviews out there~ specifically for those that climb a lot on granite?,May 2017,Jun 9 2020,1
39,Unparallel Newtro,1,1, Here is my short term review having broken in the shoe and done a bit of rock climbing in it: The UP site is sorta wrong. It feels like a Hiangle in terms of stiffness~ but the rubber is thinner and more sensitive.  The heel fits me a bit more snug. The shoe is slightly less downturned~ but with less forefoot volume and a moderately pointier toe. The closure and entry system is actually super useful. A bit less midfoot volume than the Regulus and maybe the Regulus LV. The heel also feels way more secure for me. Super powerful toe~ but doesn't feel as clunky as many stiffer shoes. The rubber overlaps with C4 in terms of shore hardness and feels closer to C4 than the RH rubber of the Regulus. Not a shoe for smearing~ but could be a great granite/limestone/edging shoe.  I wear a size 10 street and am a 9.5 Sirius~ 9.5 Sirius LV~ was a 9.5 Regulus LV~ 9.5 Hiangle~ 40.5/41 Solution. They are incredibly snug/tight at first~ but once on feel like a good balance. I could maybe go a half size up for longer sport/multipitch. These would actually be an awesome crack shoe. Very low toe profile and big toe patch. The closure system might get in the way when jamming really deep. I dunno. Super versatile shoe.,May 2017,Jun 29 2020,0
40,Unparallel Newtro,1,2, I tried on a pair of the VCS a half size down and they felt great in the heel~ but I had some weird dead space around the big toe~ felt a little long. Currently exchanging for 1 size down. It felt about the same stiffness as the TN Pro~ but with a snugger heel and better closure system if you want to tighten up that midfoot area. I think the TN Pro will still be my go-to bouldering shoe~ but the NewTro VCS will be for anything where I want more sensitivity and power in the big toe. Like small footholds on overhangs. It's also easier to get into. The toe was also more downturned than the TN Pro~ and seemed like it'd be worse for smearing just from walking in them. If I end up liking it more than the TN Pro~ I'll probably get the lace version too. ,Aug 2018,Jun 29 2020,0
41,Unparallel Newtro,1,3, It breaks in to be quite a bit more sensitive and can actually smear better than you would expect. Dan Turner has a glowing review on his YouTube channel. ​ ​The TN Pro is weird to me. Fairly thick rubber and felt more voluminous than the Regulus in the midfoot.,May 2017,Jun 30 2020,0

44,Unparallel Newtro,1,6, No issues with the routes and the renovation at RnR is pretty nice. But~ had issues in the past with the owner or management staff. I’ve worked with a lot of college students who’ve all had ongoing~ very poor experiences with RnR regarding memberships~ fees~ and some pretty awful customer service.

47,Wild Country Friend Cam's Size 1-3 sling question,1,1, Excellent quality~ lightweight pieces~ although sizes are slightly off from the similarly-colored Camalots (only really matters on Wingate).

The extendable slings aren't long enough to make a difference~ in my opinion. Dragons have longer extendable slings~ but no thumb loop.  yeah~ i really like the dragons but I also have small hands so I prefer the lump loops. if the expanding sling doesn't make a difference then I might keep my metolious double rack. ,May 2014,Apr 8 2020,0
49,Wild Country Friend Cam's Size 1-3 sling question,1,3, I like them~ I have .4-3 in friends and C4s as doubles.  When you extend the sling~ pull the bar tack (aka sewed part) away from the cam~ not the smooth side of the sling to keep everything neat. I find the extendo-slings handy when a piece is under a little bulge or just a tiny bit out-of-line.  Placing a c4 or mastercam unslung I really notice the difference in drag/walking~ the Friend slings do have their use~ you just still need alpines or shoulder runners depending on the route.,Sep 2018,Apr 8 2020,3

57,Wild Country Friend Cam's Size 1-3 sling question,1,11," I have Dragons and one of my partners has the Friends. While the total length isn't very different~ the Dragons with extended slings just ""feel"" like they're extended more~ maybe because there's more sling and less cam stem?

58,Wild Country Friend Cam's Size 1-3 sling question,1,12, I totally agree with this. I have a single rack of WC friends from .4-4 and depending on the route you still need aplines. The extendable draws on the WC friends is only good for little overhangs or extensions. ,Jun 2018,Apr 13 2020,0

60,Wild Country Friend Cam's Size 1-3 sling question,1,14, I have a set of .4-3 WC friends with extendable slings and a set of C4s in the same sizes. They are great cams of the same general design~ but I generally prefer the WCs to the C4s because of the sling. Also~ there is no anodized finish on the contact points of the lobes on the WCs so theoretically they MIGHT grip better than a new C4? I have yet to be upset about having an extendable sling~ though I do not always use it. There are times where it provides just the right amount of extension and can save you from needing to use an alpine draw if you need to conserve them.,Apr 2020,Apr 27 2020,1
61,Wild Country Friend Cam's Size 1-3 sling question,1,15," Doesn't this belong in ""climbing gear discussion"" not ""climbing gear reviews""? And you just need to get in the habit of pulling the strand with the bar tack when you extend.  I'd also tell you partners to get in the habit of shortening it BEFORE they remove it and repack it when cleaning.  These two things seem to be the main complaint~ though I don't understand why as it isn't that hard to be smarter than two loops of dyneema instead of one.",Oct 2010,May 2 2020,3

I agree that it's not as hot as I'd like - I prefer my espresso on the 'scalding' end of hot~ but it's fine as long as I don't let it sit out.  I wonder if temp preference is a learned thing (I still don't know how Italians immediately shoot their espresso at the bar without wrecking their mouths) or an innate preference.

117,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,1,17, The Edelrid MegaJul checks all the boxes you're looking for~ but I just can't bring myself to recommend it for everyday use. I like it for alpine since I can give an assisted lead belay on twin/half ropes and it's super light.

139,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,2,18, Just like in skiing~ there is no such thing as a quiver of one! I've been taking up an Edelrid Gigajul and a Kong GiGi on multipitch lately~ and I've been pretty happy with that system.  I like the Gigajul a tad bit better than the Mega Jul for rapping~ and it also feeds out easier while lead belaying with thicker ropes.  While I love the smoothness of a Grigri while belaying in guide mode~ the Kong GiGi is so much lighter and takes up so much less space on a harness that I prefer taking that now.  The Kong GiGi doesn't quite feed as smoothly as a Grigri~ but it's still pretty good (just be sure you know how to use one SAFELY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkkFmLoFcFc).  The other nice thing about the GiGi is it doubles as another belay device in case for some reason I drop my Gigajul (although you can always use a Munter hitch in that scenario I guess).  I NEVER use my Gigi or Mega Jul for belaying in guide mode . . . my arms get too worn out pulling the rope through! The one advantage a Grigri has over the Kong GiGi is the ability to quickly and safely lower while belaying in guide mode with just a simple redirect.  I suppose if I was on a climb with a big roof and thought I might need to lower my second~ I'd take my Grigri.  But otherwise I find it is just too heavy and cumbersome given its limited functionality. Regarding the Climbing Technology Alpine Up~ I really had high hopes for it.  It excels in rappelling~ and I love it for that purpose.  But at least with the rope sizes I use (around 9.2-10.2)~ it locks up too easily on lead belay and pulls like a bear in guide mode.  I think with twin ropes it might work great~ but with a single rope it's far from ideal.,May 2018,Jul 1 2020,1
140,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,2,19, You can rap with a gri gri - its not very difficult to acheive with a biner block. No need to also bring an ATC. I head up with only a gri-gri on every multipitch I do and I also rap with it. After years of use~ I haven't had any snags or issues and it's a smoother rappelling experience. Not futzing around with an autoblock and you can ascend your rope much quicker if you need to.

143,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,3,2, I’m going to throw in my two cents I suppose since we’ve gotten around to discussing the Gri Gri more in depth.  All use cases are situation dependent.  That said~ i’ll swap between using an ATC guide~ MegaJul~ Kong GiGi and a Petzl GriGri. Depending on what I’m looking for that day.  Anyway~ for the fastest rappel descents I’ve ever accomplished~ my partner puts their ATC on rappel~ then I choose a strand underneath their device and rappel it with the Gri Gri. No carabiner block or anything else needed. The side I rappel down has a knot~ the side I don’t does not. I clip my tether to the other rope so that it stays within reach and control. When I reach the anchor~ I clip in to a quad with my tether~ give slack~ yell “off rappel~” untie the knot~ thread the rope~ retie the knot and wait for my partner. They clip the quad~ we pull the rope~ stack rappels again and commit to the rope~ remove the quad and zip to the next anchor.  My partner had the option to use a fireman’s belay from me~ or can add a prussik backup while I’m already sliding down the rope.  No one has to wait for anything and there’s no unnecessary risks added. ,May 2016,Jul 1 2020,3

146,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,3,5, My personal approach is to bring two devices (ATC or GiGi + GriGri). Is it really worth pages of hand-wringing MP threads to save 68g (the weight of a GiGi) off your rack? Plus then you have a second device in case someone drops theirs. If so~ others have well addressed the pros/cons of all the various devices in this thread (mega jul~ giga jul~ alpine~ alpine up~ grigri~ etc.). They all involve some sort of compromise.

147,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,3,6, I like the GigaJul. Its very versatile as long as you pair it with the right rope. If the rope is too big of too fuzzy~ it becomes really hard to use in break assist mode and then you only have a very heavy (but more durable) equivalent of an ATC Guide.

149,Best quiver of one multipitch assisted brake device,3,8, Any max rope diameter you suggest keeping under? I know fat/fuzzy can add a handful of mm's either direction. Try it on the ground first.  I've had a 9.8mm rope work well while an another one of the same diameter was a total pain in the ass.  9.5mm or smaller should be fine. Rappeling works in assist mode~ but I agree with many reviewers that you get a smoother ride in manual mode with a prussik.  ,Sep 2015,Jul 1 2020,0
150,4 person tent recommendations - Epic Vestibule Required,1,0, Hello outdoor recreation hive mind. Looking to crowd source some gear research. My wife and I are currently looking for a new tent. When we're on climbing trips we prioritize comfort over compactness. So we're looking for a tent with an epic vestibule (or option to add one). At present we've looked at the Marmot Orbit 4P and the REI Kingdom 4. It looks like some Big Agnes have the option to aftermarket a vestibule on for additional money. Two doors ideal and must be free standing.  Has anyone seen or purchased such a tent? I've spent a bit of time looking around but there are so many manufacturers out there I know there must be something I'm missing.  Thanks in advance. ,May 2011,May 14 2020,0
151,4 person tent recommendations - Epic Vestibule Required,1,1, I'm also looking for something in the 4 person range. My last tent got destroyed during a windstorm at Jack's Canyon~ so I'm also looking for sturdiness/durability. I've had trouble singling out higher end car-camping tents - most tents are either nice and backpacking oriented or cheap/(flimsy?) and car camping oriented. The two you listed look great in terms of being sturdy/solid higher end~ but I'd love to hear other ideas in the same range.,May 2018,May 14 2020,2
152,4 person tent recommendations - Epic Vestibule Required,1,2, Not sure what you mean by epic vestibule~ but I'd recommend the REI Basecamp 4 over the Kingdom 4 unless you really want the stand-up height. The Basecamp will still have plenty of room to spread out for two people~ is much more stable in challenging conditions and is a lot easier to set up~ especially if you're short. The Kingdom is an excellent fair weather flop and drop tent if you're gonna be in one place for a while~ but I think the Basecamp 4 is much more versatile if the conditions might get a little sporty and you arent sleeping more than two people on cots and dont mind not being able to stand up fully inside the tent.  The MSR Habitude is also a really nice tent that's similar to the Basecamp in terms of build and intended use. The Nemo Wagontop is another excellent option that is more similar to the Kingdom build (tunnelish shape~ more headroom~ etc.).  It might help for you to think about what sorts of conditions you intend on using the tent in. A dome style tent like the Habitude or Basecamp is much better in prolonged wind and rain~ while the tunnel shape of the Kingdom or Wagontop provide more vertical walls and more consistent standing headroom throughout. Are you looking for a mesh heavy tent that excels in more humid environments where you need maximum air movement? Or will you be in the desert where sand blowing into the tent is a concern and more nylon panels down low could be advantageous? Do you prefer having greater privacy without the rain fly on (more nylon panels down low)? Or do you not care about privacy panels or figure that you'll have the rain fly on most of the time anyways?,May 2017,May 14 2020,0
153,4 person tent recommendations - Epic Vestibule Required,1,3, @Gregory~ if you're looking exclusively for car-camping applications~ a dome-style tent like a Habitude or Basecamp (see above post) is what you want. Tunnel or cabin style tents are sails in high winds in unprotected tent sites and will implode quickly if not aggressively staked out~ and even then the stakes will only do so much with a cross-section as huge as tunnel and cabin tents have. If you're looking for a backpacking 4 person~ that's a whole different beast but the REI HalfDome 4 Plus~ MSR Papa Hubba/Elixr 4 are good places to start. In general for wind resistance~ well-designed pole sleeves distribute stresses better than clips (but are more of a pain to assemble) and hubbed poles are weaker than individuals. Though modern aluminium hubs made by DAC do a much better job in wind than the old cheap plastic hubs made by others~ provided all of the poles are seated fully in the hub intersections.,May 2017,May 14 2020,1

155,4 person tent recommendations - Epic Vestibule Required,1,5, I also have the kingdom 4. Super roomy and very nice. Haven’t spent a night in a storm in it yet~ but I don’t have super high expectations.

Tell me the last time you saw a test piece crack climb sent on hexes? It can and has been done~ but nowadays virtually never. Ever see Tommy Caldwell or Honnold carry a hex? In experienced hands a cam is far more reliable in more placements~ was faster to place on the way up~ and has more utility for the weight in other varying size cracks on the route.

208,You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro...,3,7, With the assumption of a good placement I'm ambivalent. Hex~ cam~ nut~ pin~ bolt - all satisfactory. Have pitched off onto all of them~ over time. I'd add that I haven't felt the urge to tote hexes along on a climb in more than 20 years. Even when doing super easy but long approach / remote alpine rock routes~ I tend to go with cams and nuts~ not hexes. I personally don't find them as versatile. I learned to trad a long time ago. Hexes were once part of my A Rack. They went to the B rack and then finally~ through the fact of simple disuse~ they went to the bottom of one of my oldest spare gear bins. They haven't been disturbed in so long I probably need a shovel to dig them out of there. I'm not passionate about gear~ frankly. Its like any other tool~ a means to and end. We can all revel in a perfect hex or nut or cam placement. But at some point~ its just a placement~ and so long as the pro is solid for that placement~ it doesn't really matter what particular piece of gear is. ,May 2015,Jun 4 2020,8

When a climb gets technical~ steep and physical~ I would never reach for a hex. They are usually too fiddly! Hexes shine as anchor pieces and pro at easy stances.

As it is~ I climb most at Seneca~ which has predominantly irregular cracks. When the climbing is steep and technical~ I reach for cams. When the cracks are too irregular~ I place a nut or a hex.

So given a choice~ I'll fall on a bomber hex. That said~ I rarely take my hexes on multi-pitch now and usually let them stay home for single-pitch unless I know I need them. Sometimes I think of selling them~ but every once in a while I find that sweet spot where only a hex will do. Unfortunately~ it's usually when the hexes aren't with me.,Sep 2018,Jun 4 2020,1

239,You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro...,4,18, Good question. The scenario I envisioned had the hex placed like a nut~ not like a hex in a crack at Indian Creek. The cam placement was also ideal. I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes. So in this scenario both are ideal placements.  Whether you’d fall on a perfect placement in solid rock after you’ve already racked and placed it is just one small aspect of why people prefer one type of gear over another; and I don’t think it’s gonna get you the answer you’re looking for.  Like most here~ I’d be equally happy to fall on a bomber cam or a bomber hex. But I’ve never routinely carried hexes and likely never will~ while I (almost) never start up a trad climb without some cams~ so yes I prefer cams and no I’d have no preference which to fall on. ,Apr 2010,Jun 5 2020,2

241,You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro...,5,0, I think the 3 best uses for hexes are 1) if you have to bail and leave a piece of gear and 2 ) they worked really well to hammer on your nut tool to get up stuck nuts. 3) to keep a rope  from getting sucked in to a crack,Jun 2011,Jun 5 2020,5
242,You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro...,5,1, I would whip on either if the placement is good in good rock. A hex still receives a kn rating and is basically a stopper/nut. Hexes we're once the standard for racks but that was before cams were invented. They aren't sketchy when used properly~ cams are just easier to handle and place quickly which is why many climbers never will use hexes anymore.,Dec 2013,Jun 5 2020,2
243,You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro...,5,2," Hex:  a large Black Diamond cowbell although I'd have to walk back to the car (or head home) to get it more than likely as I rarely carry them anymore. (route specific) That said~ I have seen both nuts and cams pull on people in falls. 2 examples below. 1st) Cam story. I once saw a single~ only 1/2 way in shitty placement~ crumbly rock~ original ridged stem friend~ hold about 300 lbs (2 people) who fell @ 200' together on to it.  (double fatality) Lowering them to the ground was a nerve racking experience for 2 reasons that still make me catch my breath. 1st) We 3rd classed the descent and were over 200' up off the deck with no gear other than their stuff that had been left on the ledge. (no harnesses~ not tied in). Next~ for whatever reason~ a crowd chose to gather directly under us~ and there was plentiful large loose rock and boulders in the work area that likely would have killed them below had we knocked a single one off~ and they couldn't understand our directions asking them to GTF out of the way. That said~ I believe that a cam would be more likely to fail from what I have seen. 2nd) Nut story. I once saw (We were on P2 of the next route over I ""heard"" it rather than ""saw"" it - then we gave CPR till a doc showed up and said stop) a guy eat dirt after he pulled 4 wired nuts in a row~ 2 or 3 of which he had already fallen on. At no time did this fella take a 20' ""whipper"" onto a piece although it was @ a 70' fall in totality. This was on a route known for solid wired nut placements yet dude ripped out 4 in a row~ 2 (or 3) of which had already held him as he hangdogged his way up (fatality).  It's possible that I prefer a hex because I've seen more folks fall onto cams than hexes. Lots more~ more falls = more placement failures. So nut or cam? Ya pays yer money~ ya takes yer chances.",Mar 2006,Jun 11 2020,0

I belive~ guessing on this~ that she couldn't get a piece out so they set up for her to lower him down to get it out. She peeled off her shoes~ got comfy~ put dude on belay.  In the usual hubbub and flifflaff~ they stuck in a friend in a crack above them which was @ 20 feet over to the bolts but didn't double check everything~ and the end of the rope was tied to the friend but she wasn't tied in to it. She had him on belay and was lowering him. His weight pulled her over and they both hit a ledge on the way down which killed them both. He was @ 20 feet below her~ the rope going through her belay.  Both were hanging on the cliff off of the friend and they were on the same rope~ which had held their fall when they got to the end of the bitter end of the rope. ",Mar 2006,Jun 12 2020,1

Cons: The bottle pocket on the side is stupid short. Not quite enough storage in the lid. YMMV It took a lot of effort to capture the lid closure loops in the plastic hooks so I had to file down the bumps inside the hooks but that was an easy fix. Seems to be holding up ok.

288,Can you soak a rope too long when cleaning?,1,17," Let's keep this fine thread going.  You probably shouldn't wash your rope at all~ especially with soap~ unless there is poop on it or something.  It won't make it ""clean"" (i.e.~ remove the layer of aluminum oxide that typically makes a rope look filthy)~ but it will diminish the dry treatment and the quality of the handling. I learned this the hard way~ with a coupe ropes when I started out climbing.  Best practice is to keep it clean~ by using a tarp/rope bag whenever possible~  If it's getting dirty~ use a wet rag to wipe it off. If it's picked up a lot of grit~ you can submerge it in clean water a couple times to get the grit to drop off.  But the propensity to pick up grit means your rope is becoming worn out.  It will still work safely~ but the handling will start to suck and it will wear out your gear much more quickly (due to the grit acting like sandpaper when you lower and rappel).  ",Jun 2010,Jun 11 2020,1

294,Camp Photons,1,0, Hey all~ I've got a couple questions (see bold below) about CAMP Photon wiregates as racking 'biners~ as I ponder an unnecessary switch from BD neutrinos. Searching forums has been inconclusive (surprise)~ so since MP is in no shortage of opinions~ I'd love to hear your experience with Photons~ knowing that I'm particularly interested in the downsides (if any). THIN NOSE PROFILE: -   Light and allows for more space on your harness... GREAT. But I also read in a different thread that the thin/more sharp spot between the basket and the nose could result in rope damage if you somehow manage to fall there. Is that fantasy or has anyone had that happen? WEAK SPRING: - The old version was a little weak in the spring. Was this resolved with the 2017 redesign? Are Photon springs now snappy... and how long do they stay that way? I've only owned two Photons and one would occasionally get stuck in the open position~ resulting in its early retirement. Was that a one-off? Thanks!,Jun 2019,Apr 19 2020,0

296,Camp Photons,1,2, I have a lot of photons. When the gates get sticky I just lube them and they keep working fine. Not a deal breaker for me. I still think they are great for racking and alpine draws. ,May 2014,Apr 19 2020,6
297,Camp Photons,1,3, I have a few I use on alpine draws. I've never had any negative thoughts about them. The size and shape make them good for taking a double length sling and making an alpine draw short enough to not get in the way. Basically~ I fold it over like usual to make an alpine draw~ then do the same thing again so my double length draw is the same length of a regular alpine draw. I can undo one iteration to get extension equal to a regular alpine draw fully extended~ then if I need more extension under the other iteration to get it fully extended. Need a big carabiner to make that work with nylon slings. ,Oct 2018,Apr 19 2020,3
298,Camp Photons,1,4, I previously used photons and nanos on all my racking biners but stopped. The nose on the photon is just not a good design and they easily get hooked around each other if you are thrashing around. One simple design change~ making the width of the nose wider than the distance between the wires on the gate would resolve my issue. Also the sticky gates do get annoying because you have to lube them frequently.,Dec 2012,Apr 19 2020,1
299,Camp Photons,1,5, My photons are five years old~ never cleaned or lubed but the gate is still quite snappy. I feel like I’m in the minority with that but that’s been my experience.,Mar 2016,Apr 19 2020,11

301,Camp Photons,1,7, The thickness of the Photon at the rope bearing surface is very thin. Theoretically~ this would make rope drag worse and~ if taking lots of whips~ wear out your rope faster. Not sure if these factors are significant in real life. Something like a Petzl Ange has much more surface area in the basket. My favorite racking biners to replace Neutrinos are the DMM Phantom.,Aug 2014,Apr 19 2020,0
302,Camp Photons,1,8, All my photons are great~ no issues~ and work as expected. No spring issues~ rope-drag issues any of that. Have never lubed any of them.

Now my nuetrinos (think I have one sticking) and my BD Oz (I constantly have 1-3 sticking and requiring lubricant) those are another story.,Feb 2013,Apr 19 2020,4
303,Camp Photons,1,9, I've used them quite a lot and the gate sticking issue was very common a couple of generations ago but was resolved a few years back.  They still will start losing their spring tension/snappiness after 400+ days of use~ but that's to be expected of most wiregates.  I've fallen on them quite a lot at this point and have never had an issue with them.  I have experienced the hooking issue Parker is talking about~ (mostly in chimneys and flares) but it's never been bad enough that I'd want to change to a heavier/bulkier carabiner.  The light weight and low profile is well worth it to me.,Oct 2007,Apr 19 2020,3
304,Camp Photons,1,10, Been using them since they came out.   I really like them~ especially for alpine stuff.  Never had any issues.  Lately however I’ve been switching over to Mammut Crag wire and solid gate biners.   They are a little more robust feeling and confidence inspiring.   I’m also starting to use the Camp Dyon and like them but they are pretty pricey.,Apr 2012,Apr 19 2020,1
305,Camp Photons,1,11, I'd go with nano 22 over photons for racking. If you're not going premium like chimera/alpha/helium/dyon~ might as well get some lightness. You can find them on sale for not too much more than photons.,Oct 2010,Apr 19 2020,9

307,Camp Photons,1,13, All of my alpine draws are photons and have been great for the last three years. I have a mix of the pre 2017 (some of which have inconsistent spring tension) and current design ones. The current models are fix the spring and tension issues. I have also become a big fan of the Dyons.,Jul 2016,Apr 19 2020,0

310,Camp Photons,1,16, I am in full agreement with you~  but the Mammut Crag is just beefier and just gives me a little more confidence~ I’m sure it’s a totally unfounded and I’ve taken lots of falls on Photons and will continue to but the Crag is starting to become my new favorite.  I have a handful of the Mammut Wall Lights~ which are their equivalent of the Nano. I REALLY like them. I had never seen a Crag until you mentioned them but that looks very similar to the Photon in size and utility. ,Jan 2016,Apr 20 2020,0
311,Camp Photons,1,17, I have been on the eternal search for the perfect biner. Right now~ my racking biners are all CAMP Dyon's for my Dragon II's and Neutrino's for C4's~ just because they come in the correct colors. Dyon's have the thinnest nose profile~ yet retain a good sized rope bearing radius. The CAMP Photon~ Orbit and the BD Hotwire are about the same size. The Dyon is slightly smaller~ and the DMM Chimera/Phantom are the smallest carabiner I will carry.  I threw the Spirit in there for comparison.  I prefer a full size biner for sport draws~ no reason to try and save a few ounces for the pain of a mini biner. All of my alpine draws have either a Chimera or a Phantom~ since I also have a rack of gear on me and need to shave ounces wherever I can. The action of the CAMP Orbit/Photon is much softer than either the BD~ Dyon or DMM wire gates. Some people like snappy gates~ others like softer gates.  Clock wise from top left:  DMM Chimera; DMM Phantom; Petzl Spirit; CAMP Dyon; BD Hotwire; CAMP Orbit and CAMP Photon. ,Jul 2015,Apr 20 2020,2
312,Camp Photons,1,18, +1 on sticky gate issues with the photons. Personally I've had this issue with a couple of my newer ones (last two years) rather than the previous generation. Lubing the gates seems to do the trick. Still my racking carabiner of choice.,Jan 2015,Apr 20 2020,0
313,Camp Photons,1,19, As important as the axis pictured here~ (if not more so) is the profile as it informs how many carabiners you can fit on a gear loop.  I haven't used BD carabiners in years now~ but that and weight were the two biggest differences I noticed when I made the switch.,Oct 2007,Apr 20 2020,1
314,Camp Photons,1,20, As important as the axis pictured here~ (if not more so) is the profile as it informs how many carabiners you can fit on a gear loop.  I haven't used BD carabiners in years now~ but that and weight were the two biggest differences I noticed when I made the switch. I use a gear sling if I am having trouble with too much gear on my harness. I actually hate the feeling of a full rack on my waist~ so I tend to use a sling for most multipitch climbing. ,Jul 2015,Apr 20 2020,0
315,Camp Photons,2,0, Thanks for all the productive insight everyone~ I really appreciate it! There has been zero thread drift~ no infighting~ AND... no one posted the DMM anchor failures video- I'm amazed! I rarely ever clip the racking 'biner directly (almost always use an alpine draw- either fully extended or folded)~ so snagless racking 'biners aren't really worth the investment for me. However~ for all of my alpine draws~ I will be upgrading both 'biners from neutrinos to snagless keylock DMM Chimeras. Clipping and unclipping cam slings with neutrinos is really my main carabiner pain point. And based on your feedback here~ my plan is to eventually upgrade my racking Neutrinos to Photons and accept the (very minute) risk that in the off-chance I clipped the racking 'biner directly and fell~ it might somehow land on the thin/sharpish spot I originally asked about. I might just stick with Neutrinos since I just got an MM Cadillac and now have 2 extra gear loops...,Jun 2019,Apr 20 2020,3
316,Camp Photons,2,1, I actually find the reverse true...I can't stand a notched biner for racking. Nothing worse than being all scrunched up under a roof and having a racking biner get snagged on my gear loops. ,Jul 2015,Apr 20 2020,2
317,Camp Photons,2,2, and this is yet another plus for the Dyon... To my recollection~ the Chimera has a VERY wide nose~ which scrunches everything on the harness~ ugh. I use Dyon's exclusively for racking biners~ as well as the bolt/gear side of all my alpine draws (I think the weight penalty is worth having the Alpha Sport for the rope end of alpine draws). I seem to never see Chimera for less than $10/ea~ whereas the Dyon can typically be found for about $8-$8.50/ea~ which made a substantial difference when I bought  ~100 of them.  Final point for the Dyon~ there is NO biner that snags less than a dyon~ period.,Aug 2017,Apr 20 2020,3
318,Camp Photons,2,3, Totally agree with the Dyon nose design being both innovative and effective. I think I have 25 or so.  I do like the Chimera/Phantom size for alpine draws.  If I'm on a route requiring 10-12 draws~ I am probably wearing a gear sling for my nuts/cams~ with all of my harness gear loops open for draws~ I don't really worry about the width of the biner...but I did measure these with a caliper at the widest part of the nose that would have to go through a wire or bolt~ not the rope bearing surface. Dyon:  5.5mm Hotwire:  9mm Chimera:  12mm Photon:  8.5mm Phantom:  6mm Spirit:  7mm,Jul 2015,Apr 21 2020,2
319,Camp Photons,2,4, just another 'I use to use photons~ but have now mostly switched to dyons and love it' user. Only con is the photons are cheaper I guess~ but before I discovered the dyons~ photons were my top choice. Edit: I've also treid heiums~ cause a friend raved~ but i'm not a big fan: Not enough colors~ 2 of mine got sticky gates now~ often find the nose doesn't fit through anchor chains~ and they take up noticebly more space on the gear loop... EditEdit: Also~ I've come across some anchors before in which I would fir nothing but a photon. Cray. EditEditEidt: Ranting about my irrelevant gear preferences is nice~ haven't got to do that with any friends in a number of weeks....,Nov 2014,Apr 21 2020,2
320,Camp Photons,2,5, I use the Photons on the rope side of my alpines and have loved them so far. I've put roughly 200 pitches and plenty of whips on them; no issues.  I prefer snagless biners for racking and mostly use Hoodwires~ but I also have some Heliums~ Anges and Dyons. Heliums are probably my favorite but they don't come in enough colors and are super pricey.  I extend almost every placement but after making a few desperate direct clips in the Creek~ I wouldn't feel confident in such skinny racking biner. Noticing how the biner would have been levered against the crack I was super happy to have a thicker Hoodwire there.  The Photons are so long and thin it wouldn't take much to snap them. Obviously no biner is intended to be levered but I think the Photons are particularly weak in this regard. And that's the last thing I want to have in my mind as I'm pulling some desperate moves over them. ,Jun 2016,Apr 23 2020,2
321,Camp Photons,2,6, I actually find the reverse true...I can't stand a notched biner for racking. Nothing worse than being all scrunched up under a roof and having a racking biner get snagged on my gear loops.  Buck- so interesting- I always thought I'd find notched racking 'biners annoying too~ but until very recently~ never once had one snag on me- under a roof~ or otherwise! Lately I've been trying to rack gates-out (for harambe!)~ and experienced my first ever snag on a racking 'biner this way (caught my harness). I love how gates-out feels on the ground~ but when I'm pumped and fumbling for gear~ it always ends up more arduous for me. Guess I'm just a 'gates-in' kinda guy since I learned that way and I'll just have to except the chiding from my friends...,Jun 2019,Apr 23 2020,0

324,Camp Photons,2,9, Christian- agreed~ Chimera seems wide~ but I always keep alpine draws racked on my back loop by themselves and can comfortably fit at least 6 on each side~ plus one quickdraw each (14 total alpine+sport draws)- usually more than enough. Plus I have my belay device and a locker for tethering on the back-right and my anchor sling/cordalette on the back-left~ so that's 9 total biners on each back loop. 9 'biners isn't horribly cramped~ but that's with Neutrinos... I wonder if switching to Chimeras would make it a problem~ and perhaps I should consider the Heliums? I don't like the way the DMM Trad Alpha's kinked spine feels in your hand and I don't love the Dyons either. The only problem with Heliums is they don't come in a non-racking color~ which is why I'm leaning towards gunmetal colored Chimeras~ but they're fucking $15 each (!!!) and I'd need like 34 of them... ouch!,Jun 2019,Apr 23 2020,0

328,Camp Photons,2,13, Thanks for sharing Matt. I totally agree this is all a matter of preference~ that's why I don't just go with cheap and functional Dyons. And ditto about just having fun- especially with trad. I'm way more willing to push grade into the 11's on bolts~ but l'm kind of a weakling trad gumby (just shy of 2 years experience) and I don't enjoy climbing much harder than 5.9~ though I'm getting better all the time. I too need all the help I can get.,Jun 2019,Apr 23 2020,0
329,Camp Photons,2,14, How much have you clipped Alpha trad/sport in the real world? The only reason I have them is the bent spine~ I found that I can lock it into my hand much more securely- obviously each UX is different but I was never able to ensure security every single time with a straight spine~ as there's nothing to catch my hand on...vs the Alpha Sport has not only the bent spine but also ribs to grip~ along with the nice bent gate to slam the rope through. Heliums are nice and all~ but just too tough to get them less than $10/ea and the nose size limits it's versatility vs the Dyon~ which helped me make the wholesale switch.  Agree w/ Matt that they are almost as good to clip as the Alpha Sport though... ;),Aug 2017,Apr 23 2020,1
330,Camp Photons,2,15," gonna point out another aspect that no one else has mentioned so far.  i've noticed Photons seem to have a higher tendency to get into crossload orientations w the clipped rope~ esp across its gate~ more so than most other biners.  i've climbed with people who owned them~ saw that many times i first noticed it out at JTree~ on multiple occasions that one day.  seemed and felt like too often.  then one time a borrowed rack for Indian Creek happened to come w numerous Photons~ so i played w them at home.  i simply rigged a sling on the high back of a barstool w a Photon to clip a rope into~ and flicked rope around w hand at various angles~ no diff than the way a clipped rope commonly moves around due to typical leader or belayer movements.  i could easily flip that biner to have its gate rest on the rope or sling and stay that way.  harder to do this with other biners.  very difficult to do this w the WC Helium~ another lightweight wiregate~ which i happen to have many due to other favorable factors beyond that~ i've done no formal studies on this.  if someone gives me access to a lab and a blank check~ sure~ i could put in some research hrs.  but i think there is such a thing as ""too light"" for some biner uses say hypothetically one could make biners out of a miracle material that's light as paper and still strong as aluminum. everyone can see how that could be a bad idea in some situations~ right?  i mean~ with a biner that could get re-oriented by the faintest tug or a mere light breeze~ or could now get into and stay at previously impossible orientations bec it no longer has much heft~ like literally as flimsy as a paper biner cutout~ that should lead to some nervous concerns anyway~ i pointed this out to 3 people at the time.  told them what i had noticed~ but that they ought to check that out too and see for themselves.  2 have many Photons on their rack~ and 1 was considering switching to them.  they all ended up going w another option and i'm sure Photons do excel in some other aspects. not saying they're bad in every way or anything like that. am quite happy w other Camp biners that i own",Dec 2004,Apr 23 2020,1
331,Camp Photons,2,16, Last year I needed to swap out my first set of sport draws; it was around my birthday~ so I ran the numbers and figured an extra $100 over 12 cheap draws and I could get the Alpha Sport (on sale for $18 or less~ IIRC). I treated myself. They're pretty dang sweet and will last a long~ long time (don't sport enough to actually wear biners out~ it seems - dogbone age does it).,Oct 2010,Apr 23 2020,1
332,Camp Photons,2,17," Good point~ totally anecdotal~ but I have also noted that the light weight biners seem to get in bad loading configurations much more easily than what I would call ""Old School"" carabiners. ",Jul 2015,Apr 24 2020,0

338,Camp Photons,3,3, Don't you??? On a lot of alpine pitches this is the norm. Also quasi alpine routes too. P2 of Physical Graffiti in Red Rocks is 180+ feet. 18 alpine draws would be a piece every 10 feet which if you fell plugging your next piece could be 20 foot whips each time. Similarly P3 of R&D in Leavenworth~ WA has almost a full 70m pitch AKA even bigger falls. These are really easy routes~ so it's more acceptable to run it out and carry less slings~ but point is~ 17 sounds like lot but it's not!,Jun 2019,Apr 28 2020,0
339,Camp Photons,3,4, FWIW~ I carry 14 draws (12 alpine/2 quickdraws) even on short trad routes (70-100')~ since I never know what side I'll want to pull them off. Granted~ I'm only about 2 yrs deep into the trad game and when I'm pumped~ I'm not the best at switching hands to access the other side of my harness~ but getting better. Never discount the over the head sling with one biner on it.  Sling it with one biner and you can clip it directly to the racking biner on your cam. A few extra slings are not heavy~ and they can also be used to sling chicken heads or tie off pitons. ,Jul 2015,Apr 28 2020,3
340,Camp Photons,3,5, Am I the only one who carries some slings with single carabiners over the shoulder for extending cams? For the OP: Photons are nice~ I've only had mine for ~8 months though so can't speak to their longevity. Getting them caught on gear loops has been a non-issue with a BD harness~ and I clip gates out. I could see it potentially being more of a problem with less-plasticized gear loops like those on Petzl harnesses~ but I've never used such a harness. Edit: Oh~ hey Buck.,Apr 2019,Apr 30 2020,1

Sometimes the position you're in when you need to plug pro makes it hard to swap hands to take the sling off your shoulder (e.g. in dihedrals). Like if you have the sling over your right shoulder~ across your chest~ and under your left armpit. If your left hand is jammed you can't get it off your shoulder unless you're able to swap to a right jam.

Use double length slings and wrap them AROUND your neck and arms and clip with a single biner down by your waist/under your arm. When it's time to use just unclip the 'biner from one end with whatever hand and pull the sling straight away. both hands can reach it. No struggle. ,Jan 2016,Apr 30 2020,2

352,Camp Photons,3,17, The thing is~ most people don't even carry enough protection to support 17 draws~ regardless of the route or pitch length. I agree. I have done a couple of routes where we linked pitches. Longest was about 175 feet (Empor~ Cob Rock) I think I placed about 12 pieces. But there aren't that many routes that require a lot of gear the entire way. Most pitches have cruxes~ and then ease off. I don't require gear every 10 feet if the grade is only 5.3. And a lot of my cams have a sling already on them~ so I only need the racking biner. But there are routes where you can sling a tree or a chicken head~ or a thread~ or a Chockstone. That is when you want to have an extra sling or three. Go lighter on gear~ heavier on the soft goods.,Jul 2015,May 1 2020,0

If you need anything smaller than a black totem I would go with the z4s. ,Sep 2017,Apr 27 2020,8

376,Which small cam to use ?,1,11, The harder the crack the thinner they tend to be I think is what he meant  There are loads of easy routes that you can use smaller cams on.  A tiny crack may be the only option for gear regardless of how difficult the route is.   Why limit your options.   Small cams are the most useful cams~ you can never fit a larger cam in a small crack but you can sometimes fit a small cam in the back of a large crack.   I’ve never understood the mentality that ”I don’t climb hard enough to use micro cams”.  It means you don’t have a good imagination when it comes protection.,Apr 2012,Apr 27 2020,10

378,Which small cam to use ?,1,13, I agree~ but how many times have you placed a 00 or 000 c3 on a 5.10? Quite a few times.   I’d rather be able to place a 000 C3 than nothing.   People seem to think that it might not hold a fall so why place it?  It just might hold your fall so why not place it?   Larger gear is great if you can get it but sometimes micro cams or wires are all that is available so why not use it?,Apr 2012,Apr 28 2020,2

386,Which small cam to use ?,2,0, .1 size or smaller: I've only used for aid. Haven't needed for free climbing. Harder to place correctly due to small range~ and sometimes not as strong or pulls out easier than bigger cams. .2 size. (The Smallest the Totem comes in~ the Black one) Totem: holds very well. Good in parrelel and flared cracks. Expensive. Bulky. The following are all inspired by CCH Aliens: BD Z4 (replaced the X4). New. Not a lot of reviews on Z4s yet~ mixed reviews on X4s. Metolius Master Cams. Best Value. Inexpensive. Lacks a tumb loop. DMM DragonFlies~ a favorite of some people Fixe Alien Revolutions~ a favorite of some people All of the above applies to .3 to .5 or.75 as well. Go to a good gear shop and play with all of them. Everyone has different preferences. Of course climbing with them is even better if you have partners with different brands.,Oct 2011,Apr 28 2020,2

391,Which small cam to use ?,2,5, If it’s worth anything~ I’ve felt totems are a tad overhyped (I’ve only used a few times and don’t own)~ but my .2 and .1 X4’s are my favorite pieces. Not sure how others feel but I’ve whipped on both a number of times~ up to some 25-30 footers (nice soft catches) and trust them totally. They place well and the flexible stem is nice.

396,Evolv Supra Shoes,1,0, Just seeing if anyone out there has had some experience with the Evolv Supra~ mainly with sizing. I've owned a pair of Evolv shoes in the past~ the luchador's~ and needed to size up a full size from my street shoes 11.5 to a 12.5. I've read things online of people sizing up a half to a full~ buying them in their street shoe size~ or even going small than their street shoe size. Looking for any advice as well as the performance and fit of the shoes. Cheers,Sep 2015,Jun 10 2020,0

398,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,0, So I'm in the market for a ledge.  WAS going to Yosemite next month but that is in limbo....  but not gonna stop training (at home) or give up on the dream.  The parks will reopen! Soon hopefully... anyways There's a lot out there~ where do I begin First~ is there any reason for a single portaledge?  Usually you bring a partner they need a spot to sleep right?  Can 2 single ledges join together? Or stack like bunks?  Or do u buy a single and expect that most big wallers have their own single too?,Jul 2015,Mar 30 2020,3
399,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,1, A5/D4 Alpine Double is basically the standard though they may be a little tricky to find at the moment. Single ledges are great for soloing. ,Sep 2013,Mar 30 2020,6
400,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,2, Things have likely changed in the last ten years~ but at that time the Fish seemed to be the easiest to set up. Always wished I would have been patient and bought one as they take a couple months to make~ but were the same price. Where the cromoly steel fittings on the Fish just slide right in~ the BD fittings are tough. The BD is super heavy and sucks to set up.  Nowadays~ I think I’d buy the inflatable one if I were in the market. Better yet~ just sleep on natural ledges or do it in a push. ,Mar 2017,May 25 2020,1
401,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,3, I have a Runout Customs Double~ actually it's their Baffin Ledge with is just an extra large double and I have a D4 Trapezium.  Customs is super comfortable and fairly easy to set up and breakdown. For multi day walls its the way to go.  For one or two night walls I like Trapezium~ super easy set up like about a minute.  The downside is breaking it down and getting it into its original bag~ its not intuitive. Practice makes perfect but I'm too impatient to practice and its easier to complain about it than to actually spend the time and learn to break it down correctly.  I ended up just getting a larger haul bag for it.  ,Apr 2012,Jun 3 2020,1
402,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,4, I'd check out D4 https://bigwallgear.com/ ~ John invented the portaledge and is the only person I know of to make one design and the completely change it. That kind of deep knowledge and innovation probably bodes well for his products.,May 2006,Jun 4 2020,2
403,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,5, Hard for me to say. I wouldn't suggest buying a used ledge as your first ledge if you can afford a new one. Better to learn on something where you don't have to always question if the issue was the eledge or the condition you got it in. That said~ if money is tight~ used ledges are the way to go. Find someone with experience to help you judge a ledge you're going to buy if possible. We can usually tell from photos if it'll get you up at least one wall~ but caveat emptor.,Jan 2007,Jun 4 2020,12
404,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,6, Completely false.... the portaledge was in use DECADES before Jon starting making them.  He wasn't even the first in the US~ as that crown probably goes to Stonemaster Mike Graham of Gramicci.,Oct 2004,Jun 5 2020,3
405,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,7, I'm obviously biased~ but after FISH~ I would go with a used anything~ but make sure the fly is cherry.  They are hard to get replacements for and are super pricey if you need a new one~ and that's if you can find one. Plus if you buy from Russ (Russ is FISH) you can get a Snakecharmer while you're at it~ one of the best rope bags for walls in the business. Then get some of his Beef Bags~ the best for your 2:1 kit. Then get some of his Wall Bags~ some of the best wall bags out there. Then get two Doubloons~ the rivet hanger you didn't know you needed until you really really do.,Jan 2007,Jun 5 2020,1
406,Portaledge which one is the right choice,1,8, I think choice of ledge should be informed by your target routes.  For routes with ledges that are good enough to hang out on but not good enough to sleep on~ I can't recommend the G7 enough.  I did the Nose in a party of 3 last year~ and we ended up having a double ledge and a prototype G7.  While my partners faffed and struggled to get their cliff cabana together~ I was phatty chilling with a sandwich and a doob.  The G7 is super comfortable for sleeping and weighs so little that using it seems like a no-brainer.,Dec 2014,Jun 5 2020,2
407,No-edge resoled with an edge?,1,0, Hey everybody~  I was wondering if anyone had any experience getting a no-edge shoe (LS Futura/genius/maverink) resoled with an edge. I currently have two pairs of futura's and one desperately needs a resole~ and the novelty of having it resoled with an edge seems interesting. I'm just not sure how it would affect performance. I'm currently climbing on granite/metamorphic sandstone so it seemed like it could potentially be beneficial.,Apr 2020,May 17 2020,0
408,No-edge resoled with an edge?,1,1, Try it.  Worst case scenario it’ll be “no edge” in a few weeks anyways. ;),Jul 2014,May 17 2020,1
409,No-edge resoled with an edge?,1,2, I resoled my futuras with vibram grip2 rubber once and really liked it. Essentially they became a pair of Python's with a more snug fit and better heel.,Jun 2011,May 17 2020,0
410,No-edge resoled with an edge?,1,3, I have some futuras that have had two resoles~ each time with an edge. I didn't really do it by choice but no resoler near me has the no edge materials. They climb pretty similarly~ maybe a little less sensitive for a while but it doesn't change the shoe too much. Honestly I wouldn't do it intentionally~ but if its whats available~ its fine.,Nov 2013,May 17 2020,0

412,No-edge resoled with an edge?,1,5, You can resole them with an edge or no edge. There is a video out there by La sportiva saying that people resole them with an edge and they work fine.,May 2017,May 27 2020,0

420,Tufa Mochilla Packs,1,0, I have owned several chalk bags made by Tufa~ and Josh Kornish is a great guy to work with. I am psyched that Josh is now making packs. In short~ the Tufa Mochilla is the best pack for climbing day trips I have ever used. Over the past 20 years~ I have used packs from Black Diamond~ Wild Things~ Osprey~ Hyperlite Mountain Gear~ ZPacks~ Patagonia~ Grivel~ and others. I now own 3 Tufa Mochillas. The first Mochilla I bought for my wife~ and it is the ultralight Hybrid Cuben Fiber version here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-pack-cuben-fiber-hybrid-2-92-oz The Hybrid Cuben Fiber version is intended for ultralight applications~ and it is advertised with its limitations:  Note:  This pack is built from 2.92 oz Cuben Fiber hybrid fabric.  This  is a highly specialized pack for ultralight endeavors.  While not meant  to be hauled or heavily abraided~ this pack will last several seasons  with proper care.  In spite of these limitations~ my wife found that it carried so well that she wanted to use it as her daily climbing pack. As such~ we have now put over 100 days on it doing everything from using it as a chest pack while bouldering in the rhododendron thickets of North Carolina to approaching the splitters of Indian Creek. It is just now starting to show some signs of wear on the bottom panel:  So I now own two more Mochillas in the MUCH more durable D40 fabric: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-roll-top-limited-edition-d40 In addition to being made with a more durable fabric~ the D40 Mochilla has a rolltop rather than a drawcord closure at the top. After putting about 30 days on each of our D40 packs~ they still look remarkably new:   Note that the packs above contain absolutely everything the two of us need to go trad cragging~ including a 60m rope inside the pack on the left. Here are these packs' contents:  The Mochilla is a fairly simple pack. It comes standard as a tube with shoulder straps and sternum strap~ small tab loops for a helmet~ a small zippered pocket between the shoulder blades~ two haul loops~ a rope strap~ and a removable foam back pad. It can be made with either a draw cord top closure or a roll top. I prefer the roll top. It comes with a removable waist belt that I do not use. My favorite thing about the pack is how well it carries when hiking and climbing. The bottom rides just above my harness~ and the top is low enough that it doesn't interfere with looking up if I am wearing a helmet:  Even when hauling a helmet and rope on the outside~ it carries well:  The pack features haul loops that are actually big enough to use with gloves. The pocket is just big enough for a phone~ headlamp~ keys~ and maybe a couple Gu packs:  I had Josh add an extra rope strap tab to mine above the pocket.  The back pad is removable and remarkably effective at giving the pack support:  Josh can do some customizations if you ask. For example~ he can add traditional loops to the bottom of the pack for ice tools~ though he is currently working on a more modern solution. He added an additional rope strap catch above the pocket on mine so that the rope strap didn't interfere with getting into the pocket. He is considering offering a folding back pad that would be long enough to use as a torso bivy pad. Daisy chains can be added.  Here is a video of packing mine for a day of trad cragging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=God1nw12Yzo&feature=youtu.be The standard Mochilla is $119~ and it comes in a few different fabric and construction options here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/peaksa-clim The ultralight Hybrid Cuben Mochilla is $165~ weighs 11.6 ounces~ and can be found here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-pack-cuben-fiber-hybrid-2-92-oz The burly as hell D40 Mochilla is $165~ weighs 14.9 ounces~ and can be found here: https://tufaclimbing.com/products/mochilla-roll-top-limited-edition-d40,Oct 2007,Jul 17 2017,7

423,Tufa Mochilla Packs,1,3," Brian~ Thank you for taking the time and effort to do a thorough review on the Mochilla.   You and Dana have your systems dialed and I'm psyched the Mochilla has been serving you well.  The Cuben Fiber pack you have was the first production pack and it's cool to hear it's taken some serious abuse from the thickets to the desert. Designing a single pack that excels at both technical climbing and hiking has been my primary project for the last four years; your feedback and suggestions have been incredibly valuable in this process.  I modified the webbing lengths and I'll be adding a double length bivy pad option to the site soon.  I'm also working on a bottom reinforcement for the Cuben packs. The ""roll-top"" closure is definitely the way to go.  I actually use it more as a ""flap"" closure which is super quick~ easy~ and secure:   Always happy to do simple modifications to the Mochilla and talk ideas.  The Mountain project community has been integral to the development of this pack and I'm incredibly grateful for the community support.   Thanks again~ y'all!   Happy climbing~ Josh ",Sep 2009,Jul 18 2017,5

440,Tufa Mochilla Packs,1,20," Update based on Brian's suggestions. I added a Double Length Bivy Pad to the Site  Perfect for those wanting extra back padding and a little more comfort on overnight bivies.  Single length foam insert comes standard with the Mochilla.  You can upgrade your pad to a double length or you can buy an additional double length pad. The single length (standard) is ideal for cragging and multi-pitch climbing. The Double length (Upgrade) is ideal for reducing pressure points on the hips and shoulders when lying down or insulating from the cold ground. Dimensions: 11"" Wide~ 35"" Long (Can be cut down) Weight: ﻿48 grams Made in USA  ",Sep 2009,Aug 11 2017,1

443,Tufa Mochilla Packs,2,2, These look really nice. How do the helmet tabs work?,Jan 2013,Aug 24 2017,0
444,Tufa Mochilla Packs,2,3," Thanks~ Andrew! The helmet tabs are basically two loops~ 1/2"" webbing x 3"" long.  I thread my helmet buckles through the loops for carrying on approaches.  Great for those who need two attachment points but not full daisy chains.",Sep 2009,Aug 25 2017,1
445,Tufa Mochilla Packs,2,4,   Couple of new improvements and additions to the D40 Mochilla and X-Pac Mochillas We're adding an elastic web to the 'Ice Daisy' version to hold crampons and extra layers.  The D40 is extremely durable and crampons won't puncture in the picture configuration. The compression straps for the roll-top are going to be tucked in the seam to clean up the design a bit and improve load transfer. Thank you for the support everyone~ we really appreciate it!

446,Tufa Mochilla Packs,2,5, Got to try out my Mochilla (made from the the X-50 material) for the first time yesterday.   A few hundred feet of scraping up and then rappelling down through tight granite chimneys and dihedrals and nary a scratch.  It also carries well and the build quality is good.  ,Sep 2011,Sep 25 2017,3
447,Tufa Mochilla Packs,2,6, Glad to hear you're enjoying your Multicam Mochilla~ Brandon.  Keep crushing it! I'm working through the last batch of the D40 Mochillas. I'm condensing the rock and ice versions into a single daisy chain version better suited to modern tools.  The rest of the daisy chain packs will ship with elastic webs and tool keepers.  The rest of the daisy chain packs~ both rock and ice~ will ship with elastic webs.    ,Sep 2009,Oct 5 2017,0

467,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,6, What's everyone's preference for the rain tight roll closure vs drawstring closure? I would assume the rolltop is best for precipitation (rain/snow) and the drawstring would be best for accessing the bag frequently since it's quicker? I can't decide between the two options... ,Nov 2009,Feb 22 2019,0
468,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,7, Depends on what you’re using it for. I have both~ use the cinch on rock and the roll top in winter alpiney stuff ,Mar 2014,Feb 22 2019,2
469,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,8, Hey Steve~ I have both.  I really prefer the drawstring closure~ I feel that it allows the pack to have a little more volume than the roll top. If I'm in a situation where the amount of precipitation is enough to penetrate the tiny hole left by the drawstring closure~ I'm going to be soaking wet no matter what I do! The ease of access is a plus as well.,Jun 2013,Feb 22 2019,1
470,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,9, Hey Steve~ I have both.  I really prefer the drawstring closure~ I feel that it allows the pack to have a little more volume than the roll top. If I'm in a situation where the amount of precipitation is enough to penetrate the tiny hole left by the drawstring closure~ I'm going to be soaking wet no matter what I do! The ease of access is a plus as well.,Nov 2009,Feb 22 2019,0
471,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,10, Hi Josh~ I think you have done a brilliant job of this pack and it’s always exciting to see details that have clearly evolved to suit the task. I am interested to know what the D40 fabric offers that~ VX42 does not? (I wondered if it’s being a bit more supple might reduce abrasion?). Why do many people seem to prefer the rolltop closure? Is the rope strap tab positioned where it is (below zip) so that it doesn’t put direct strain on the zip? I build a pack with the tab above the zip~ and the zip definitely wore out quicker because of it. Great work Josh! Get Outlook for iOS,Jun 2015,Jan 15 2020,0
472,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,11, Hey Katie~ Thanks for the kind words~ I'd love to see the pack you made. Both the VX-42 and DX-40 are great fabrics.  The DX-40 face fabric is a blend of polyester and Ultra-PE (Like spectra or Dyneema); it's more tear-resistant than the VX-42 and a bit lighter weight. The DX-40 is definitely a bit more supple as well.  I typically recommend the DX-40 for people in thorny / sharp areas or those wanting the highest performance. The Mochilla now has a rope strap tab above the zipper for easy zip access and a strap tab into the frame for carrying heavier loads.  I haven't had issues with these YKK Aquaguard zippers.,Sep 2009,Jan 19 2020,1
473,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,12, Hey Katie~ Thanks for the kind words~ I'd love to see the pack you made.

The Mochilla now has a rope strap tab above the zipper for easy zip access and a strap tab into the frame for carrying heavier loads.  I haven't had issues with these YKK Aquaguard zippers. Are there any downsides to the D40 or advantages to the VX42? Sounds like the D40 is lighter~ more tear-resistant~ and more supple. Is it just more expensive?,Jul 2016,Jan 21 2020,0
474,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,13, Andrew~ One of the only downsides I've noticed with experimenting with DX-40 is that the seam strength is a little weaker than the VX-42.  This is because it's made with a slightly looser poly / dyneema blend vs. the VX-42 nylon; not an issue I've had in the real world though.  I've had great feedback with it over the last 3 or so years I've been using it.  It's a pricey material for sure. The VX-42 option is also a great pack and only an oz or two heavier.  I really like the white taffeta lining on the VX-42 and DX-40 over the PU coating on the X-50. Let me know if that helps.  Feel free to shoot me a message with any other questions. -Josh,Sep 2009,Jan 28 2020,0
475,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,14, Just wanted to give a shoutout to Josh and his business. I own a Tufa Houdini chalk bag (which I use for every type of climbing that I do) and it’s a great piece of kit. It can really help to de-clutter your harness on multipitch climbs. I also just received my Tufa Mochilla today~ which I ordered only 14 days ago — super fast turnaround! It looks awesome and I can’t wait to get out with it.  Check out Josh’s products — in addition to getting best-in-class gear~ you get to support a small~ climber-owned business. ,Apr 2019,Feb 28 2020,5
476,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,15, Thank you~ Joel!  That really means a lot and I appreciate your support.  Enjoy the pack~ my friend!,Sep 2009,Mar 3 2020,1
477,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,16, I’ve been using my VX42 Mochilla down here in Patagonia this season for almost every mission~ and even took it as my only pack on Fitz Roy for 4 days. It’s the perfect on-route size and has stood up well to the abuse so far. I wish it had a slightly more ergonomic axe-carry system for modern tools~ but other than that I can’t think of a single complaint! Highly recommended! ,Mar 2016,Mar 4 2020,10
478,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,17, I just took my Mochilla out for it's first day on ice. Packed in a few miles with layers~ draws~ screws~ gloves~ etc. Had crampons~ rope~ helmet~ and tools on the outside. It got all the stuff to the climb and carried it better than expected for such a light pack. Then it disappeared on the climb. I never thought about it once or felt any strange pinches~ helmet hits~  or shoulder/chest discomfort. I really dig the zip pocket location for ease of access at belays. I'm really happy with it so far and can't wait to drag it up stuff in Red Rocks next week. It is just a well executed clean design that is super functional and well made.  I'm already confident that I'd buy another one if needed in the future. Solid work~ Josh!,Jan 2011,Mar 11 2020,4
479,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,18, I bought one custom when this thread started and put my TUFA through the paces and will take it out again this weekend.  So 3 years of abuse and no sign of it quitting!  Thanks Josh Steve,Feb 2007,Mar 11 2020,3
480,Tufa Mochilla Packs,3,19, I own 2 Mochilla Packs~ hands down the best daypack I have ever used for leading multi pitch climbs. I also really like theTufa Houdini chaulk bag~ incredible design (the best I have seen). For me personally I wish you also made a slightly larger size Houdini chaulk bag 1/2” inch wider and 1”inch  deeper~ that would be perfect for me. I normally wear size XL gloves. Thank you Tufa for making such great products. David Katz,Jan 2020,Mar 14 2020,1

482,Butora Gomi,1,0, I picked up a pair of these this week.https://www.hmhoutdoors.com/butora/men-s/new-gomi-seagrass---wide-fit/ They are a moderately downturned shoe with very sticky rubber.  Previously I had tried the Acro but the heel was crushing my Achilles. I read how they were moving to a new heel and the Gomi looked like the picture of it so I got one on the chance they would work on my wide forefoot and narrow heel. I got them in street shoe size and they are very comfortable. Toes bent but not the least bit painful~ heel locked on but no pain like the Acro. I’d probably size down 1/2 size if I really wanted a super tight fit. I’ve climbed twice in them in the gym and they performed great. I purposely picked routes with slim~ slopey polished feet and they stuck on everything.  Its a softish shoe~ not super soft like a Drago or such but def not a stiff edger.  The toe is a bit blunter than others so maybe not 10/10 for precision but decent.  Its also not super downturned so perhaps not the very best for very steep pocketed routes.  Overall I feel it’s a very solid all around shoe. I also like supporting Butora due to being USA based and hire they support USA climbing.,Jul 2017,Sep 28 2019,3
483,Butora Gomi,1,1, I also bought them recently and I am not very happy with them. I fit my foot very well and are uncomfortable to climb. Greetings,Jul 2019,Oct 2 2019,0
484,Butora Gomi,1,2, I’ve been eyeballing a pair to use in between resoling my dragos. The rubber on them is the same neofuse as the Acro right? ,Jun 2018,Oct 21 2019,0
485,Butora Gomi,1,3, Yep~ same rubber - and they actually have a new Acro~ with the same redesigned heel as the Gomi. ,Jul 2017,Oct 21 2019,0
486,Butora Gomi,1,4, Does anyone have an issue with the outer side of the heel cup rubbing too high up on the ankle bone? Wondering if I just need to size down.,Sep 2019,May 14 2020,0
487,Butora Gomi,1,5, Yep~ same rubber - and they actually have a new Acro~ with the same redesigned heel as the Gomi.  Tried the “new Acro heel” on a demo night~ still felt the same as the old Achilles-biting heel. The Gomi however was comfortable in that aspect...took quite a while to soften up~ but about 30mins into a session they feel great~ good balance of softness/sensitivity and edging. ,Jun 2017,May 14 2020,0
488,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,0, Looking at buying a 70m 9.9mm glider dry rope. I can get it for $175 brand new.  Does anyone have any experience with this particular rope?  It's a signature series bi pattern with Honnolds name associated with it.  It just seems like a really good deal.  If not~ what about maxim ropes in general? Any information/experiences with or about Maxim ropes would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!,May 2017,Jun 1 2017,1
489,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,1, They are expensive but durable and generally very well handling. It's hard to swallow the price sometimes.  I mostly buy thinner ropes with out bipattern or dry treatment to save money and have not had many maxim ropes because you can't find many that are not set treated. ,Dec 2011,Jun 1 2017,1
490,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,2, It's what I use for my roped soloing setup~ on about my 10th one...,Jan 2006,Jun 1 2017,1
491,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,3, If you do go with the blue 9.9 Honnold~ it's still a good rope (my GF owned one)~ just a little heavy for what I typically like ( I mostly climb on 8.9 - 9.4). It still handles really well though.,Feb 2009,Jun 2 2017,0
492,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,4, They're reputedly very durable~ but they have a higher than average impact force. Seem like a great sport project rope. ,Sep 2013,Jun 2 2017,0
493,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,5, The Airliner is my favorite rope of all time.,Jun 2001,Jun 2 2017,0
494,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,6, A climbing partner of mine bought a 10.2 Maxim rope a few years back. What we both noticed about it is that it is really stiff. It reminds me of typical gym top ropes in that it is not particularly easy to make knots in. At one point during a climb I noticed my well dressed and tensioned double fisherman backup knot after the figure eight follow through on my harness completely unravel itself. I also noticed well dressed and tensioned double fisherman stopper knots for rappels almost come undone. We decided that for this rope it needed triple fisherman knots. I'm not impressed with this rope. Neither of us particularly cares for it.  I don't know if all of their ropes are like this. My piece of advice is to not buy these without being able to feel and compare how supple they are compared to other brands. ,unknown,Jun 2 2017,0
495,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,7, I used the 9.9 Honnold Glider bi-pattern for a while. It starts off stiff and smooth with good handling. After I put it through its' paces the sheath softened up and it became extremely slow to feed and in general very poor to handle. It's also heavy at 66g/m~ and at that weight I wish it were more durable. ,Mar 2015,Jun 2 2017,0
496,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,8, I used the 9.9 Honnold Glider bi-pattern for a while. It starts off stiff and smooth with good handling. After I put it through its' paces the sheath softened up and it became extremely slow to feed and in general very poor to handle. It's also heavy at 66g/m~ and at that weight I wish it were more durable.  All of the Glider 9.9's come with a twill-weave sheath and are stiffer than most ropes.  I like that because I use them for lead rope soloing and the combination of slightly stiffer than normal and a smooth sheath are an ideal pairing with the Edelrid Eddy I use. As I said above~ been through about ten of them and~ while a little softer at the end of a season~ it's not markedly so from my experience.,Jan 2006,Jun 2 2017,0
497,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,9, Used to get Mammut ropes almost exclusively~ now Maxim pretty much exclusively! Have not had that particular cord~ but was impressed with some other models. ,Nov 2014,Jun 2 2017,0
498,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,10, I mean Honnold obviously doesn't trust it.,Jan 2017,Jun 2 2017,17
499,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,11, I mean Honnold obviously doesn't trust it. Does he trust any ropes?,May 2017,Jun 2 2017,0
500,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,12, I had a 10.2mm one and LOVED the way it handled.  It turned 10 last year and I retired it~ though.  Great rope with a soft catch.,Jun 2011,Jun 2 2017,1
501,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,13, had a 9.1 airliner as a redpointing rope. ended up working it really hard and it's held up better than any rope I've had~ despite being skinny and dragged through all manner of dirt and grit. Lasted significantly longer than any other rope i've had and kept a smooth sheath,Apr 2011,Jun 2 2017,1
502,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,14, Sheath on my maxim glider gym rope melted through somehow in less than 6 months of use twice a week. Will never buy their ropes again. I've been very happy with my Beal Yuji and Blue Water Lightning Pro Double Dry. ,Jun 2015,Jun 8 2017,0
503,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,15, Just bought yet another 9.9 Glider yesterday...,Jan 2006,Jun 8 2017,1
504,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,16, I've only owned one of their ropes. I bought: https://www.rei.com/product/869679/maxim-alex-honnold-signature-bi-pattern-glider-99mm-x-70m-dry-rope I took it climbing outside twice. It got a random sheath tear that exposed the core on the 2nd trip. I cannot figure out exactly how it tore as anchors were well extended. I wouldn't buy maxim ropes again. I think they have a problem with their braid. ,Aug 2016,Jun 8 2017,0
505,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,17, Dunno~ as I said~ just bought my eleventh one and have never had a single complaint with any of them - and I don't coddle them in any way.,Jan 2006,Jun 8 2017,1
506,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,18, I have owned two of the 9.9 gliders and now have a 9.5 Maxim. I love everything about these ropes except the sheath durability and for that reason will not buy another one~ at least for a few years of exploring other brands again. The super tight weave of the sheath gives these ropes their incredible handling of easier clips due to increased stiffness~ and fast handling due to the increased slickness/decreased friction. Unfortunately the tight sheath~ in my opinion~ also results in much more frequent and greater sheath damage than ropes with 'normal' sheaths. Think of the difficulty in cutting a rope that is limp versus cutting it while holding it in tension. ,Aug 2012,Jun 8 2017,0
507,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,19, I have used other Maxim ropes that I liked~ but I had a Maxim Glider 9.9 and I absolutely hated it. It was SO stiff and hard to belay with~ especially from above in guide mode. Pulling slack through grigri kind of sucked too. I sold it after using it a few times. It might have broken in if I used it more~ but honestly~ I've used lots of other ropes and that was the worst.  ,Aug 2011,Jun 8 2017,0
508,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,1,20, Yeah the 9.9 Gliders are stiff due to the twill sheath weave which is quite a bit finer~ tighter and smoother than most rope sheath weaves. In many respects it handles a lot like a Mammut SuperSafe 10.2. But those qualities are what I need for pairing with my Edelrid Eddy for roped soloing - might look at other ropes for climbing with partners. None of the ten that i've owned ever got much in the way of sheath damage to speak of except one that was a couple of years old and somewhat abused. ,Jan 2006,Jun 8 2017,0
509,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,0, I've had a 60m glider (I think it's 10.2?) for 3 years and have found it to be very durable. I paid $120ish when i bought it (60m~ dry~ no bi-pattern)~ and that seemed like a very good deal at the time when I compared it to others with similar specs. I'd say it feels heavy for the diameter~ the pattern I have is not particularly cool (but whatever)~ and it's true that it doesn't hold knots as well as others when it's new. But it broke in nicely~ seems durable as hell~ and was a good price.  My skinnier ropes aren't Maxims~ but I'll definitely consider one of their skinnier ropes when it's time to get another.  BTW~ FWIW~ Maxim is the climbing brand of Teufelberger. They have a reputation for excellent cordage across many industries~ and are definitely not an unknown or bootstrapped operation.,Sep 2015,Jun 8 2017,0
510,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,1, I have used other Maxim ropes that I liked~ but I had a Maxim Glider 9.9 and I absolutely hated it. It was SO stiff and hard to belay with~ especially from above in guide mode. Pulling slack through grigri kind of sucked too. I sold it after using it a few times. It might have broken in if I used it more~ but honestly~ I've used lots of other ropes and that was the worst.  I feel the same way~ Maxim makes (in my opinion~ based on my desired rope characteristics) the WORST ropes.  Names like Glider and Airliner should really be Steel Cable and Rebar.  If I'm cragging with multiple people and someone needs a catch on a Maxim~ I'll volunteer my own rope (usually a Sterling) instead of deal with what feels like 18.5 mm of high tension line stuffed into my belay device.  I can totally see why Honnold gets the ropes for free(?) and still doesn't use them :-P,May 2011,Jun 8 2017,1
511,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,2, Yeah the 9.9 Gliders are stiff due to the twill sheath weave which is quite a bit finer~ tighter and smoother than most rope sheath weaves. In many respects it handles a lot like a Mammut SuperSafe 10.2. But those qualities are what I need for pairing with my Edelrid Eddy for roped soloing - might look at other ropes for climbing with partners. None of the ten that i've owned ever got much in the way of sheath damage to speak of except one that was a couple of years old and somewhat abused.  Take a look at Tendon Hattrick series of ropes~ soon to be available through campsaver.com. Nice smooth weave on the sheath~ but still has a really nice hand. Falls nicely between the stiff Maxim ropes and floppy Petzl ropes. Really good for rope solo and standard climbing/belay situations. ,Aug 2011,Jun 8 2017,0

Falls nicely between the stiff Maxim ropes and floppy Petzl ropes. Really good for rope solo and standard climbing/belay situations.  I was using Tendon 9.8's before switching to the 9.9 Gliders~ will take a look next rope - thanks. [EDIT: Just looked. Unfortunately they dropped from the 9.8 to a 9.7 and I really feel more comfortable lead rope soloing with a 9.8 or 9.9 in the Edelrid Eddy. Tuning the device / rope pairing is pretty critical and am not too inclined to move away from a combo I know works well...thanks anyway though. ],Jan 2006,Jun 8 2017,0

514,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,5, They have a Hattrick 9.9~ as well as 9.7~ 10.2~ 10.5.  Maybe they've stopped making the 9.9 - at least it's not up on their website. [EDIT:  I did finally find it in their 2017 pdf catalog. ]  ,Jan 2006,Jun 8 2017,0
515,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,6, No problem~ I went through about a half dozen or so of the Tendon 9.8s before I decided that extra mm of the 9.9 was worth having in the rope solo rig. Will take a look next time I'm getting one.,Jan 2006,Jun 9 2017,0
516,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,7, Getting mixed reviews of the 9.9mm glider; I'm glad I purchased it at REI in the event that it doesn't work out so well.  ,May 2017,Jun 9 2017,0

518,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,9, Just cut the new 70m Honnold Glider I got a deal on down to a 60m because that's what fits in the bag I rope solo with and I don't want to carry the weight of a full 70m at the start of pitches. Don't think ill of me...,Jan 2006,Jun 9 2017,0
519,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,10, I just cut my Maxim 70m x 9.5mm in half due to a weird fray and severe kinking and swollen section after about 5 uses. This occurred in a rappel. I inspected the core after chopping~ and could not find any damage. I'm guessing one or two of the fiber bundles got severely twisted and pinched. ,Aug 2012,Jul 12 2017,0

521,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,12, Like others have said~  very durable~ a bit stiff.  They tend to have higher impact force than other similar size ropes.  9.9 KN.,Sep 2001,Jul 12 2017,0
522,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,13, I got a Pinnacle 9.5mm (really 9.7mm) for cheap in Squamish this year. Whilst It's been durable enough to use as my primary line and even left for weeks at a time as a fixed line on the chief~ you can't overlook how poorly it handles. The strange weave and stiffness make this rope a chore to clip and feed through grigri etc. All in all a good rope as a durable and cheap workhorse but unsuited to more technical climbing.,Dec 2017,Jan 26 2018,0
523,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,14, I have an older 9.8 glide 70m that I love. My partner says it’s too stiff compared to his mammut. ,Apr 2014,Jan 26 2018,0
524,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,15, Every time I buy a non-Mammut rope I'm disappointed.  These days I just go with Mammut.  I've never had one I didn't like. ,May 2011,Jan 26 2018,1
525,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,16, I have the 9.9 Biweave and I love it. Great general purpose rope for all types of climbing. I’m on my 2nd season with this rope and don’t have any complaints. Mostly outdoor sport climbing~ but used on a few trad routes as well. ,Apr 2020,Apr 20 2020,0
526,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,2,17, I picked up a maxim 9.9 bi-color dry treated. Paid a little over $200 because I like having the afore-mentioned features. It’s much more stiff than all the Sterling ropes I’ve had~ but also a little bit thicker.  Ropes are ropes... go for the features you like at your chosen price point. I personally don’t overthink it beyond that. ,Aug 2013,Apr 20 2020,0

529,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,3,0, All of the last five maxim ropes I have owned have shown really poor durability compared to any and all other brands of rope.  They handle like a dream~ but are easily core-shot.  All ropes are not equal~ although most have very similar handling and durability.  Maxim ropes unfortunately just don't last.    ,Aug 2012,May 13 2020,0
530,Maxim Ropes?  How are they?,3,1, I only have the Platinum. I haven't been thrilled with its handling--even for the diameter it feels stiff--but the features make up for it. I'd say durability is good-not-great for the diameter~ but I tend to be pretty tough on ropes and mostly climb on either rough granite or sandstone. ,Apr 2017,May 13 2020,0

532,Thesis Survey: Climbing Brands and Educational Content on Social Media,1,0, Hi everyone~ I'm in need of some help. I'm studying how climbing brand's use educational content on social media for my master's in sports management. I'd really appreciate it if you'd fill out my survey! Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0UCxjM_kZLfaUSr5Iv4dkwA4GYsUtLZOO-o_wV9XD_KFjbw/viewform,May 2020,May 10 2020,0
533,Thesis Survey: Climbing Brands and Educational Content on Social Media,1,1, Your questions are leading~ as if you know what you want to get in return - it's a great way to get the answers you want. Right?,Mar 2006,May 11 2020,3
534,Thesis Survey: Climbing Brands and Educational Content on Social Media,1,2," You're off to a start.  Market research surveys take quite a bit of understanding.  keep it up and you'll get there. Keep working on more objective questions.  A ""maybe"" answer would have been what I would check on most of these if it were available. There are many factors that go into successful brands and products~ utility~ design~ style~ fashion~ and endorsement. Omega Pacific was the cheap crap for decades.  Then a few years ago their design became brilliant and the brand became valuable over night. Chouinard Equipiment was a powerful brand in the 70's and 80's.  Lawyers turned it into Black Diamond.  Same stuff but a different name and the brand became slightly less valuable.  As the founder moved away from the brand and it grew in the hands of others~ it started to have a big corporate look and lost respect from long term fans of Chouinard. I could go on about many others. The idea that training content is going to make the brand is only a part of the picture.  You could provide great content but if brand was made in an unpopular overseas country it would do little to move that brand.  Petzl was just another European brand decades ago. But they really got their engineering going and came up with some clever and quality stuff.  They also have some nice content. Your survey also implies that we are concerned about safety.  That may be true for that mass hordes of new climbers. But not at all for real athletes who push the envelope and get printed up in the mags. Climbing skill~ climbing efficiency~ these are far more valuable to many than safety.  Perhaps a survey that found out what qualities climbers seek. Another question you might consider is ""how much did you spend on climbing gear in the last year?"" with multiple choice answers.  Older climbers~ like me~ have lots of opinions but spend diddly squat on new gear so you could pretty much throw out our answers.  If you want to make money you have to find out who has it and research how to get it from them. My 2 cents.  40 years marketing experience.  45 years climbing experience.",May 2007,May 11 2020,6
535,Thesis Survey: Climbing Brands and Educational Content on Social Media,1,3, Fourth question out of the gate is not really valid. I’m not so confident there is any correlation between skill and the number of years spent climbing. After my first 5 years of climbing I was still a total gumby and not ‘advanced’ by any stretch. Also~ what is ‘skill’ in this context? The grade you can climb? Proficiency in rigging~ hauling and big wall techniques? Ability to recognize objective hazards in an alpine environment? I hate seeing the weekly survey picked apart~ but consider running this by your advisor and reworking some of the questions. I’m in agreement with an earlier post that the questions are very leading. An interesting concept. Wishing you luck on your thesis.,Oct 2009,May 11 2020,3
536,Thesis Survey: Climbing Brands and Educational Content on Social Media,1,4," I understand how hard it is to create a high quality~ unbiased survey for data collections purposes. It seems simple in theory but is actually quite difficult. I took your survey~ but I agree with others that some weird assumptions were made~ i.e. one is assumed to be an advanced climber if they've been climbing more than 5 years. Also~ a lot of climbers like myself ""abide by safety recommendations when climbing"" under variable conditions~ depending on the situation. It was also unclear if references to ""improving your skill/becoming a better climber"" meant improving one's movement technique~ or improving one's understanding of equipment handling techniques~ or both~ or something else~ or whatever the survey taker assumes it to be? People's assumptions of what this means as they approach the survey could muddy the results I think~ but not in a way you could dissect after the fact since there's nothing in the survey which allows people to let you know their interpretation. Learning how to use a specific piece of equipment vs learning how to belay or how/when to sling out trad protection pieces are very different types of content. I feel that climbers with 15 or 20+ years of experience vs climbers with~ say~ 2-6 years of experience will approach this survey very differently. Which may be one of the things you're trying parse out with your data~ but I found there to be no nuance or additional selections or ability to comment to give you any information why I feel just because a brand teaches me something means I will or won't be brand loyal or more likely to trust their reliability. Just some food for thought when it comes time to look at the results.",Mar 2007,May 12 2020,1
537,Thesis Survey: Climbing Brands and Educational Content on Social Media,1,5," The survey sucked~ unfortunately. It reeks of bias. On an anecdotal front~ I've always considered Petzl to be a great example of a brand that emphasizes the user-perspective educational strategy very effectively. I can quickly read their cartoon-style instructions~ and could also watch how-to videos for their products. That information is very easy to find on their websites~ etc.  That said I have never once bought a piece of Petzl gear simply on the virtue that the company emphasizes an educational strategy. And I never made a decision not to buy a given piece of gear from a different company based on some perceived lack of educational material~ either.  I don't need a how-to guide attached to every claw hammer I might purchase. Same is true for climbing gear. Its actually kind of ridiculous to expect educational materials be made available at every point of purchase.  However I don't make or break buy decisions based on entertainment value either. Patagonia makes some cool videos but never once did one of those cool videos prompt me to make a purchase. In the case of Patagonia the only successful strategy is 40% off~ hah! I don't care who their ambassadors are or what they do~ I truly don't. They can fire them all for all I care. Oh wait~ they did that already. I don't care~ they're just models anyway.  Good~ no~ great gear at a fair price~ that's what I'm after. If a brand were to ask me my advice it would be ""focus on making the best gear possible and then sell it at a fair price."" Edu material is a good attribute to add to a product line but at least for me that edu material is not actually material to a purchase decision.",May 2015,May 12 2020,2
538,Harness,1,0, I'm trying to decide on a harness. I'm thinking about the BD solution guide bc I want to start doing multipitch this summer. I often do only single pitch outdoor climbing though... Right now I'm doing lots of indoor climbing. So I need a good all-rounder... Any opinions?,Jan 2020,Jan 20 2020,1
539,Harness,1,1, Gear loops are kinda small on the solution guide. I like the Petzl Sama and the metolius safe tech. Enough space on gear loops and comfortable (for me) at a hanging belay.,Jul 2018,Jan 20 2020,11

543,Harness,1,5, Hey. Thinking about the petzl Sana or black diamond guide. My friends are saying go for the BD~ but I don't know. Opinions on those two specifically,Jan 2020,Jan 21 2020,0
544,Harness,1,6, FWIW~ I recently ordered a BD solution guide~ and can confirm Travis' comment- the gear loops are smaller than I'd like; but more importantly~ the non-adjustable leg loops were too small for my thunder thighs~ even while only wearing thin pants.  I ended up selling the harness to a scronny friend who is just getting into climbing~ and got myself a petzl Adjama- much more gear loop space~ super comfy~ and even has a 5th rear gear loop for anchor gear/extra stuff. I agree with Layne~ great all around~ comfy~ lots of gear~ and not too expensive.,Aug 2016,Jan 21 2020,5
545,Harness,1,7," Petzl Adjama for a ""low cost"" all around Harness~ and the Arcteryx AR series for ""High end"" all around. The solutions gear loops are wayyyyy too small for multipitch.",Jan 2017,Jan 21 2020,2
546,Harness,1,8, Also the key difference between the Sama and Adjama is that Adjama has adjustable leg loops; Sana’s are fixed and also not friendly for thunder thighs! Boo!,Aug 2016,Jan 21 2020,2

548,Harness,1,10,,Mar 2006,Jan 27 2020,0
549,Harness,1,11, Sad to see that Misty Mountain gets skipped. I guess they don’t contribute enough ad dollars. I think a MM will be my next harness if I can ever wear out this Adjama. My last one was a Cadillac back around 1990. I loved that thing. ,Mar 2019,Jan 27 2020,2
550,Harness,1,12, These review sites make money when companies offer them kickbacks for a click-to-sale. It’s called affiliate marketing. Metolius and Misty Mountain may not offer as much (or any) money in comparison to Petzl or BD. Always be skeptical of review sites with this business model. ,Dec 2016,Jan 27 2020,4
551,Harness,1,13, I’ve never gotten the Misty mountain fan club. I haven’t been impressed by any of their harness. They are comfy if you are just standing there~ but the fleece lining gets so hot and sweaty so fast~ and the waist is basically just a 1” seatbelt harness covered in foam. Every other manufacturer (yes I know that’s an exaggeration~ but most of the big names) has found ways to spread that load better than EVA foam.  Misty even had to stop selling a whole harness and a leg loop option because so many people were getting their family jewels crushed.   How does a company that only specializes in one thing get that one thing THAT wrong?,Jan 2017,Jan 27 2020,5
552,Harness,1,14, There seems to be two camps here~ people who love MM harnesses~ and those that have never used a MM harness. I'm on my third MM Cadillac~ and second Turbo.  The comfort is outstanding~ the gear loops are perfect~ they are extremely burly and they look cool.  I also own a BD Momentum and a Petzl Sama. They are good gym/top rope harnesses~ and maybe sport climbing~ but they suck balls for trad climbing. The loops are too small on the BD~ and the Petzl has a strange overlapping gear loop that makes it hard to pick gear out~ which is not good for hard trad. So buy whatever you can afford~ and then go and buy a Misty Mountain when you age enough value comfort over trendiness (Arc'teryx). ,Jul 2015,Jan 28 2020,2
553,Harness,1,15, I haven't owned one~ But I have climbed in both a Caddy and a Turbo. Both were meh at best for me. ,Jan 2017,Jan 28 2020,1
554,Harness,1,16, Agreed. ,Apr 2002,Jan 28 2020,0
555,Harness,1,17, I own a misty. It sits in my closet in favor of my camp energy which is both much more comfortable and lighter.,Jul 2013,Jan 28 2020,2
556,Harness,1,18, I thought the whole point of the Solution Guide was to offer a model with larger gear loops than the Solution~ are you saying they didn’t even got that right? Also from BD’s website the Solution Guide does have a 5th gear loop at the back. ,Mar 2019,Feb 21 2020,1
557,Harness,1,19, Misty Mountain Cady and Turbo are great multi-pitch harnesses that rack plenty of gear~ are comfortable~ and very durable. Plus you can call them and discuss several customizable options. Doubt any other manufactures will do that. Made in the USA ,Mar 2012,Feb 21 2020,1
558,Harness,1,20, I haven't owned one~ But I have climbed in both a Caddy and a Turbo. Both were meh at best for me. I think they fit certain body shapes better than others...my buddy that is very thin with a long waist (5'10 and 140lb) does not like either the Turbo or the Cadillac.  Loves his Petzl Calidris~ even though they wear out every few years.,Jul 2015,Feb 21 2020,0
559,Harness,2,0," I thought the whole point of the Solution Guide was to offer a model with larger gear loops than the Solution~ are you saying they didn’t even got that right? Also from BD’s website the Solution Guide does have a 5th gear loop at the back.  Yeah that was my understanding too~ but I was let down. held them side by side with a BD Momentum harness and saw no difference.

560,Harness,2,1, My own two cents based on harnesses I have used: Petzl Adjama: -you will bruise with more than a light trad rack -I used it on RNWF of half dome~ massive bruises. -small gear loops -good gym harness -good sport harness -cheap -not comfy for even semi-hanging belays Misty Mountain Cadillac -comfy af -the extra gear loops are good for walls and beginner trad when you feel the need to bring the kitchen sink -it is pretty heavy~ but not you still have a good range of motion and your rack will weight more -takes a beating (I've put over 1000 granite and sandstone pitches on mine in the last 2.5 years) -it's nice as a beginner when you aren't as dialed on light and fast systems Edelrid Ace Ambassador -super comfortable -roomy gear loops -cool color -light as all get out -holds the nose record -I use this for lightning fast climbs and projecting/hard onsighting -starts to droop a little past a double rack to 4 BD Momentum -jk~ just don't,Mar 2016,Feb 21 2020,1

Disapointing cause I love my Solution~  but it's just not roomy enough for trad/multipitch and was hoping the guide would offer a good alternative.  Looks like they focus more on the material durability than loading capacity.  Damn~ need to look elsewhere for a multipitch harness then.",Mar 2019,Feb 21 2020,0
562,Harness,2,3, I think you should hang in a harness before you buy it. Hang in several of these recommended harnesses and then make your choice. Most climbing shops will be happy to let you try them out.,Aug 2006,Feb 21 2020,2
563,Harness,2,4, The best harness I have ever had was a Yates. I've had a couple of BD they were ok. I use a metolius now & have for several years~ I think I'm on my third one now. I like it only because it fits me well and it has never hurt me in a fall. I like Scott's idea~ go hang in them.,Feb 2013,Feb 21 2020,0
564,Harness,2,5, Singing Rock Dome harness. Comfort ***** Super big gear loops ***** Inexpensive ***** Saw a rigger/camera person from 'Free Solo' wearing one. My favorite trad harness in 45 years.,Apr 2010,Mar 4 2020,1
565,Harness,2,6, My girlfriend just got the Solution guide today...looks badass. Material seems bomber~ the gear loops are pretty slick and she said it was quite comfortable. Obviously haven’t put it through a “hanging belay” test yet~ but I’ve never been in a harness that made a hanging belay very comfortable anyway. I’ve been wearing the previous version~ the chaos~ for years and love it. I would only suspect BD made the current iteration even better. ,May 2013,Mar 11 2020,0
566,Harness,2,7, Im curious about the bd technician. It has 5 gear loops~ 4 ice clippers~ adjustable leg loops~ and possibly bigger gear loops than the guide. Thinking it may have to be my do everything ,Dec 2017,Apr 3 2020,0
567,Harness,2,8, Also a fan of the Adjama. I also have a solution for sport climbing~ but I don't think I've touched it since I picked up the adjama. Maybe a couple times for gym sessions but that's about it. Now that I think of it~ I am not even sure where it is....somewhere in the garage I guess. The adjama is cheap~ flexible~ has a ton of room for gear~ and comfy IMO. I also like the slanted gear loop~ although my partner has said they didn't like it. Keep my gear in front and ready to grab. Edit: the one thing that I don't like about the adjama is the leg loops....they don't go small enough to fit my chicken legs~ and i tend to like non-adjustable leg loops. ,May 2015,Apr 3 2020,0
568,Harness,2,9, The adjama was a disappointment in the area of leg loops imo. When in a hanging belay~ or when belaying someone who may hang dog~ the loops creep into my  crotch more than I'd like. Although I do have fairly slender upper legs.  It's never mentioned in these discussions but my go to for trad racks is my DMM Viper 2. 5 loops with good room and it has a floating belt for making things even. I really like the floating belt. It solves another issue the adjama has. It's lighter weight than harnesses like the Cadillac but is big enough to comfortable and handle heavy racking. The only thing I wish was different is that the 5th gear loop connects low on the belt line whereas others~ like the adjama~ have the 5th loop connected towards the top. Minor I reckon. ,May 2017,Apr 3 2020,0
569,Harness,2,10, The Sama is the same harness without the leg buckles. I have one~ like the fit~ don't like it for trad at all. The rear gear loops are moronic. ,Jul 2015,Apr 3 2020,1
570,Harness,2,11, Arcteryx harnesses are worth every penny.,Aug 2016,Apr 3 2020,8
571,Harness,2,12, I second this. Huge gear loops super comfy and some good covid-19 deals happening right now ,Jan 2019,Apr 4 2020,2
572,Harness,2,13, I currently use an Arc’teryx harness and I was pretty concerned because there was no padding but I’ve owned it for 4 months now and il have to say I’m in love yea it does cost a lot but usually harnesses last a long time unless you’re high-lineing. Yea it’s expensive but the comfort and adjustability on the Arc’teryx harness is unreal literally everything is adjustable including the space between the belay leg loop like it’s in real how comfortable this is. It’s 25% off at Arc’teryx try it use it don’t like it return it but I highly doubt you will. Hands down best all around harness period And it’s a harness that will grow with you. For example if you want to get into ice climbing it will do it it’s got all of it built in. I’m a one and done kinda guy buy once don’t buy till it’s shot. It’s worth it send it bro.,Dec 2019,Apr 22 2020,0

580,Harness,3,1, Expensive~ but Arc'Teryx AR395 is a really nice harness with large gear loops and adjustable leg loops. Also allows great freedom of movement/feels like not wearing a harness IMO. Arc'Teryx harnesses sometimes are sometimes described as uncomfortable for hanging belays~ but I and everyone I've spoken to who owns an Arc harness finds them comfy for hanging belays.  I use men's size medium AR-395 for ice season (need the adjustable leg loops for my layers and thunder thighs) and a women's large FL-365 (same at AR-395 but w/fixed leg loops). Found the BD solution legs to be too confining at my waist size. Arc makes the C-Quence harnesses now that I think replace FL-365. Supposedly comfier.,Mar 2015,Apr 29 2020,0

584,Harness,3,5, Gear man! You? Usually not much gear.  If I know exactly what I need~ that will go on my front gear loops~ and maybe a biner of nuts~ but otherwise I put most gear on the shoulder sling. Usually I put draws on my front gear loops. Nut tool on the left front. Water~ shoes~ whatever left rear. Spare biners~ belay~ anchor on right rear. Shoes or water in the back. I need to tell you guys though. Today I was on a climb I’ve done several times. I had maybe 25’ to the anchor and one #3 to get me there. Just so happens that said #3 hanging from gear sling has intertwined itself with a locker on my harness in such a way it was impossible to undo with one hand (two lobes were through the locker). So after a minute of switching hands and fiddling (and swearing and such) I down climbed 10 feet or so and had to take on my last piece so I could use two hands to unsnarl my gear. ,Mar 2016,May 11 2020,0

586,best resoles??,1,0, Looking for recommendations on good places to get a resole. In the past I went to someone who seemed to use rubber quite different (more aggressive) than what was on my original shoe and I didn’t love it. If you could mention what makes your place good it would mean a ton!! Price and time are certainly factors but the QUALITY of the resole matters by far the most to me! ,Aug 2018,Apr 27 2020,0
587,best resoles??,1,1, Do you mean that the resole changed the shape of the forefoot/toe of your shoe?  The rubber itself~ contrary to what some will say~ won't change the shoe into a more aggressive last.  The rubber is either softer/grippier~ or slightly harder and will edge a bit better.  I've had good luck with Yosemite Bum~ but they only offer Evolv rubber- which works fine for me.,Jul 2011,Apr 27 2020,1

600,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,0, Has anyone had access yet to the new ATC Pilot? Any first impressions? Any word on release dates?,Sep 2015,Dec 11 2016,0
601,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,1, There was discussion on MP.com earlier this year -  MP.com thread   My memory is little hazy~ but IIRC someone mentioned that ATC Pilot is remarkably similar to a belay device from one of the European manufactures.   You decide - ATC Pilot ,Feb 2012,Dec 12 2016,4
602,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,2, Thanks for the comparison. Especially considering I just heard back from BD Pilot not released until Summer 2018.,Sep 2015,Dec 12 2016,1

604,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,4, Thanks Jim - almost all the reviews are other than English~ so helpful to know what they have to say.,Sep 2015,Dec 12 2016,0
605,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,5, I was able to translate several reviews on the Salewa Ergo - enough positives to give it a go until 2018 when hopefully the Pilot comes out.,Sep 2015,Dec 23 2016,0
606,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,6," Happy New Year~ everybody!!   In my opinion~ the Salewa Ergo is quite good. However~ I would much rather recommend this German creation: Edelrid Megajul   I've been belaying with it for more than two years now and~ although I am still an absolute BD-ATC-fan~ this tiny~ mega light German invention offers exactly the same belay functions as the BD-ATC but it weighs much much less. AND on top of that it works as a ""semi"" automatic blocking device (""semi"" as the are very carful not to call it ""full"" automatic as for example the Petzl Grigri~ for some legal reasons). I don't know whether it is obtainable in the US thogh. Saludos~ Yelmo",Jan 2017,Jan 2 2017,1
607,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,7, I just has a chance to use both the Mega Jul and Sawela Ergo. Between the two~ I found the Ergo smoother for lowering and the MJ more grabby. Also the Ergo more positive passive breaking. The only downside I found with the Ergo was tendency for the break side rope to drift off the right side of the guide when lowering~ which is a narrow metal edge. The pictures of the Pilot appear to have solved for this wear by rolling the edge of the metal.,Sep 2015,Jan 2 2017,0
608,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,8, I hate rappelling with MJ~ can't get it run smoothly. Makes me   Bounce to much.  Nice if you have to work the rope tho~ pretty much autolocks.  But just haven't figured out a smooth rappel down the rope with it.,Oct 2014,Jan 25 2017,0
609,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,9, Flip MJ around and rappel.,Jul 2017,Nov 2 2017,1
610,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,10, i would also recommend the mammut smart as a similar device,Nov 2015,Nov 2 2017,2
611,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,11, Flip MJ around and rappel. Fine for single pitch~ but if you go past a rap station and have to work back up that MJ is gonna lock the wrong direction.,Jan 2017,Nov 2 2017,1
612,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,12, I think I mentioned the Pilot in another thread~ but after belaying a half dozen pitches I think it's a pretty solid device. No rappelling so I can't speak to that. It is definitely better than the Mammut Smart. I can't speak to the Megajul because I haven't used one. The lowering is REALLY smooth. That's actually the feature I like most about it. I think with more use I may start to prefer it to the grigri~ but right now I'm more used to the grigri so it's probably still my preferred device. Tested it with a 9.7mm rope and the BD Vaporlock carabiner. My partner also used it and said he liked it a lot and preferred it to the megajul. It locks up well~ but does let a little rope slowly go through if you're not applying pressure to the brake strand. Easy for boinging the leader back up the rope after a fall. ,Aug 2011,Nov 2 2017,0
613,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,13," Haven't seen the ATC pilot but had an opportunity to use a "" Click-up"" in Kalymnos & thought it was DOPE despite writing it off as a gimmick at first. Super smooth~ easy to lower/pay out slack~ etc. Might be a viable option if you're not getting off the ground/rappelling and want an assisted-brake belay device. Plus~ that audible ""Click"" when you fall makes you feel all warm and fuzzy about the brake working properly. http://www.climbingtechnology.com/en/outdoor-en/belay-devices-and-descenders/assisted-braking/click-up",Jul 2007,Nov 2 2017,0
614,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,14, I've been using the ARC Pilot for about a month now~ and I'm really impressed with it. It works great for toprope and lead belay. Lowering is smooth. It locks well to hold falls. A slight lift on the thumb catch and you can pay out slack easily. Durable and easy to use. Comparable to the Jul 2. Well suited for single pitch and gym use.,Apr 2010,Dec 8 2017,1
615,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,15, I've been using the ARC Pilot for about a month now~ and I'm really impressed with it. It works great for toprope and lead belay. Lowering is smooth. It locks well to hold falls. A slight lift on the thumb catch and you can pay out slack easily. Durable and easy to use. Comparable to the Jul 2. Well suited for single pitch and gym use. I 100% agree. I get asked about mine all the time in the gym. I've used it a lot for both top rope and lead. ,Aug 2011,Dec 8 2017,0
616,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,16, Tried the ATC pilot. It's on display in BD store and for sale too.  It's smooth for lowering~ easy to use~ but just why..... 40.00 for a device for gym and cragging without the ability to rap in most situations... If they make a double slot model I'd be interested~ until then~ it's just like the jul~ or mammut device~ extremely limited. It's a bit bulky too for those with small hands.,Nov 2010,Dec 18 2017,0
617,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,17, Works great in the gym~ lowering a heavy climber is super smooth~ I can adjust the speed and it catches falls instantly. For me~ autolock works on this device just as well as on Wild Country Revo~ which was 3x the price. Hang dogging is a pleasure~ since the device holds the climber in place. A lot less load on my hands.,Jan 2018,Jan 13 2018,1
618,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,18," I just got one a week ago and have taken it to the gym to test twice now. Obviously this is a purpose built~ assisted braking device~ designed for belayers on sport routes outside or in the gym. I suppose you could take it out multi-pitch but I think I'd rather save weight in those situations~ although this device is by no means bulky or heavy. If you know how to use a regular ATC style device it is totally redundant~ but I intend to keep it on my harness for when climbing with newer climbers for my own peace of mind~ besides the benefits that I personally see from using it myself for belaying my friends. Anyway~ for its purpose its excellent. It auto-locks effortlessly (I dont work for BD so I can say auto-locks without worrying about liability.) I weigh ~170lbs and the device took a lead fall in the gym with 10mm-ish rope~ no hands on the device and it locked. I do not recommend you try this~ we did this indoors in a semi controlled environment~ Im sure there are scenarios where the geometry-based brake assist could be overcome~ such as if the finger/thumb loop were snagged on something~ causing the device to be pulled away from the belayer and disengaging the device. Also~ I am clearly not a scientist. The lock happens quickly~ and the disengagement is super smooth once you get the hang of it. You simply roll the device back towards your waist to start lowering and away from you to slow it down or stop. It's also intuitive as the rope runs just like a normal ATC. A biggie for me is it's only $45 for a huge amount of additional safety on sport routes~ especially outside where anything could happen. I also mentioned it is not bulky as some other posters mentioned. I was actually quite surprised how small the device is. I have characteristically ""medium"" mens hands~ and you can see in these pictures it looks like Andre the Giants hands holding the device.  Pros- Auto-Locks No Moving Parts Light (much lighter than my old BD ATC ((did not have cut-outs)) Smooth lowering (also protects your hands from rope-burn) Cheap Seems to lower with more ease than my friends Mega Jul~ and my friend who already owns a GriGri2 plans to swap out to the ATC Pilot after one use. Stows nicely with BD locking beaners and doesn't hang off the harness as far as a locker + atc (I just get personal enjoyment out of well engineered pieces of metal) Cons - Can't rap with it No top-down mode Redundant accessory purchase if you already own an ATC~ but good for peace of mind if you occasionally climb with less experienced belayers or just want an easier belay.  Bottom line~ its great for avid sport climbers looking for a little added safety who climb with a group and only rap ~50% of the time. ",Sep 2014,Mar 9 2018,1
619,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,19, Anyone care to compare this to the old Wild Country SRC?  They seem to be a similar shape and function.   That has been my favorite device for being a belay slave or training new belayers.   I picked up one of the Mammut auto locking things with the big handle and have not liked it at all.  ,Jun 2011,Mar 20 2018,0
620,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,1,20, Reviving this thread to ask: Is there a certain type of biner to use with the pilot? I know with geometry based assisted lockers~ the biner matters. Should I aim for the fattest~ roundest stock HMS biner I can find? Or any biner without weird kinks in it?,Jan 2016,Dec 19 2019,0
621,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,0, Round stock works best.,Apr 2012,Dec 19 2019,0
622,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,1, I believe most large HMS carabiners should work~ as long as the pilot does not clash with the carabiner~ when rotating.  I haven’t noticed any really significant difference in the assisted breaking~ when using round vs I-beam shaped carabiners.   For the assisted breaking function to work properly~ the belay device has to be able to freely rotate~ without obstruction.  Some mini-HMS carabiners or large HMS anti-crossloading carabiners could interfere with the rotation.  ,Aug 2013,Dec 29 2019,0
623,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,2, I found that the edelrid “bulletproof” biners  with the steel insert do not work well with the pilot; they are too smooth and the rope does not catch. I have used the pilot quite a bit and that’s the only issue I have had so far. I use it for anything other than multi pitch. ,Aug 2018,Dec 29 2019,1
624,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,3, I use it for multi pitch~ it replaces my Grigr.  It’s lighter than a regular ATC so I just carry both.  I don’t always carry it but if I’m going to do a long climb I’ll take it instead of the Grigri. ,Apr 2012,Dec 30 2019,0
625,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,4, You can rappel on a single strand with the ATC Pilot.  The set-up is exactly the same as rappelling with a Gri-Gri.  You can also use a carabiner brake rappel set-up~ if you want to rappel on 2 strands and do not want to bring an extra belay device. My preferred set-up for multi-pitch is to have the leader carry a GiGi or Ovo for belaying the follower directly off the anchor and have the second belaying the leader on an ATC Pilot or GriGri.  When you transition to rappelling~ stack the rappel devices on the rope with the 2-strand device above the 1-strand device.  The 2-strand rappel device prevents the rope from being pulled through the anchor~ without requiring a carabiner or knot block.,Aug 2013,Dec 30 2019,1
626,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,5, I gotta admit. This method of stacking devices instead of the old eight on a bight and carabiner is fairly slick. Kills two birds with one stone and keeps at least one climber alive. ,Mar 2019,Jan 1 2020,0
627,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,6, Very smart method! Do you have a Youtube video of that?,Jan 2018,Feb 7 2020,0
628,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,7, Very smart method! Do you have a Youtube video of that? No.  For someone who is already experienced with rappelling~ it is really quite simple and easy to practice.  Just practice it on horizontal ground~ first.  There can be a little bit of slippage through the 2-strand device~ which is easily stopped with either a friction hitch backup or a brake hand on both strands.  So~ the person stacked on top should be attentive and watch for rope slippage.  ,Aug 2013,Feb 7 2020,1
629,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,8, I think BD suggests you use their Gridlock pear-shaped locker with the device.,Sep 2014,May 3 2020,0
630,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,9, I've spoken extensively in a previous thread~ I feel that the pilot is the absolute best belay device for the gym~ it's quick to learn to use and incredibly convenient- but that it doesn't have as much place outdoors. ,Mar 2015,May 9 2020,1
631,New Black Diamond ATC Pilot,2,10, I used to carry a Gri Gri and ATC on multi pitch climbs but more and more I’m brining the Pilot and my ATC and leaving the Gri Gri behind.   The Pilot weighs less than the ATC~ I get the auto locking of the Gri Gri at a fraction of the weight.   ,Apr 2012,May 9 2020,2
632,5.10 Crawe First Impressions,1,0, First~ these shoes have C4 rubber (EpicTV has them listed as HF)~ more stiff than the Aleon~ about as stiff as the new Hiangle.This shoe is what I thought the Aleon would be~ forefoot is quite flat and stiff~ very~ very comfortable. Foot rests flat in the shoe~ think Skwama with less toe curl~ or perhaps Butora Acro Wide. With how flat the forefoot is~ along with the relatively low volume of the front of the shoe~ I don’t think the shoe should be sized too aggressively~ but I’ll have a better impression once the shoe is properly broken in. The heel is relaxed~ not as much as the Aleon~ but does make me wonder about aggressive heel hooks. I tend to wear my street shoe in 5.10 shoes and that’s what I ordered. Overall the fit feels right~ though I do have a bit of air when I go from standing on my toes to heels on the ground. I’m tempted to try a half size smaller~ but I really don’t think the performance (besides possibly heel hooks) would be much better~ given how stiff and flat the forefoot is. At that point~ might as well just pull out Hiangles. The fabric on the inner sides of the shoes that the Velcro attaches to sits loose and looks a bit out of place~ but I don’t think will negatively effect performance. Overall~ really great first impression~ looking forward to climbing in them. With all the gym closures~ hopefully I’ll get outside within the next weekend or two.,May 2019,Mar 17 2020,1

643,Stocking up first aid kit,1,0, Hi there~ I am planning to climb Ben Nevis with my friends (once the weather gets better) and I am currently checking my equipment. I noticed that my first aid kit certainly needs a refill. I already stocked up most of it (bandages etc.) but I am still missing disposable gloves. I did a quick research and found these. I experienced some skin irritation in the past so maybe they will be fine since they are latex-free. I hope that I won’t need to use them on our trip~ but you never know. Does anyone have recommendations or tried these gloves out? Cheers~ Chris,Feb 2020,Feb 11 2020,0

648,Stocking up first aid kit,1,5, We don't even use sterile gloves in ambulances. Your gloves are to protect you from other peoples bodily fluids~ not to keep someone in a very non-sterile environment from getting dirty. Save your money on pre-packaged sterile gloves and just get a box. I use them in the garage all the time and keep a few pairs in my trauma kits. And the OP's linked gloves will not protect the wearer from pathogens. Get some purple nitrile gloves and call it a day. Pro tip: If things are looking to get really messy~ double or triple up your gloves so you can peel a layer off if you need to clean hands for a minute and then have to get back at it.,Aug 2018,Feb 11 2020,10

650,Stocking up first aid kit,1,7, Sorry~ I'm a bit late to the party but here's my .02 Don't waste money on sterile gloves~ you are not in a sterile OR doing a procedure so they will do you no good.  I work in EMS and in an emergency department at a hospital and we use regular old nitrile gloves 99% of the time. Before all this covid crap started you could pick up a box at Harbor Freight for just a few bucks.  Honestly if I am climbing with family or trusted friends I'm not taking the time to glove up before I go to work on them but I do carry a couple pairs of nitrile gloves for when I come across someone I don't know who needs help.,Sep 2018,May 3 2020,0

652,Beal Birdie for lead rope solo?,1,1, Haven't roped soloed with it~ but do own a birdie. The construction is solid~ but it feels like the cam is a little slower to engage than a grigri~ so that's worth consideration. Also definitely use an anti-cross loading carabiner~ BD gridlock is probably the best option.,Apr 2019,Apr 30 2020,1
653,Beal Birdie for lead rope solo?,1,2, Ryan~ thanks for the reply! Using a gridlock is definately a good idea,Apr 2020,May 1 2020,0
654,Beal Birdie for lead rope solo?,1,3, No worries man. Just in case you're not aware the recommended way to load a Birdie (or any camming device) into a gridlock is with the device in the little keeper basket~ the opposite of how you'd load a tuber. This keeps the Birdie from being able to get caught on the gate locking mechanism~ which can potentially lead to a torque failure when loaded (here's an example of that with a Spoc).,Apr 2019,May 1 2020,1

656,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,0, I'm wanting to start some bouldering projects outside~ and have been looking around online for a pad to save up for. The thing is~ there are so many options out there~ and I'm not sure which is worth my $$. Any suggestions for a first pad? Or any input on how you went about finding Your first pad? I'm wanting to stay on the cheaper side if possible ($150) and would love to find a pad that's on the easier side to lug around from route to route.  Thanks in advance! *this has been cross-posted*,Jun 2018,Aug 31 2018,0
657,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,1, either buy the cheapest pad you can find (metloious~ or whatever~ on sale for like $100-$120)~ they are all pretty much the same~ or buy an organic~ they are a little better (better foam~ made in usa~ they last longer).,May 2014,Aug 31 2018,4
658,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,2,,May 2014,Aug 31 2018,0
659,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,3, I’d checkout the Mad Rock R3. It’s a great pad~ environmental friendly~ and pretty affordable. It was my first pad and I still have it to this day.  It’s on the heavier side because of the foam used to filled it~ but it’s definitely a great value. Packs down nice~ carries a lot of gear if wanted~ and has a nice coverage area (especially designed for uneven landings). ,Mar 2018,Aug 31 2018,2
660,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,4, When every fall is a ground fall~ spending a little more to keep those ankles intact is worth it~ imho. Organic is the way to go. ,unknown,Aug 31 2018,3
661,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,5, Go big is my 2 cents. If your only going to have one pad and especially if you are going solo get a big pad~ you can always add smaller ones later. My first and only pad is the metolious collosus trifold. Best part is it is the exact size of my tent so its like a queen size matress,Aug 2017,Aug 31 2018,0
662,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,6, A bigger pad is nice. I prefer Metolius pads after having tried a BD one. The metolius pads have the extra cloth so when you shove stuff inside the pad while on the approach~ said stuff doesn't fall out. I would also recommend seeing if your local shop has pads to rent~ that might be a good way to try one out. Otherwise head to a crag with some other boulderers and see what you like. ,Oct 2017,Aug 31 2018,0
663,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,7, I have a Metolius Session and a regular sized Organic Pad~ both good options~ but just picked up this BD Drop Zone at a really good sale price from Backcountry. The taco style is helpful when there are weird/jagged landings to cover. Also it's larger than standard pads~ but pretty much the same price with this deal (plus Active Junky).,Jun 2016,Aug 31 2018,0

665,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,9, Check craigslist and OfferUp. Someone is always selling a pad or 3. I just snagged a brand new Mad Pad for $50. Kid only used it twice for some very light bouldering.,Jul 2013,Sep 1 2018,2
666,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,10, Metolius session is the best starter pad. You can find them for cheap~ they have carpet square to wipe your feet off on and they're nice and light. The Madrock R3 is super cool and effective but its fucking HEAVY. If I remember it weighs like 19 pounds.,Mar 2017,Sep 3 2018,1
667,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,11, Well~ I would go for cheap and fits in the car.  A nice big and thick one is great as the main pad~ add a smaller one to add coverage/cover other boulders you might hit went falling. If the pad doesn't have a mat to clean your shoes; just get a cheap floor mat (can be cut in half to save weight/bulk).,Oct 2017,Sep 4 2018,0
668,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,12, In my opinion~ just go with an Organic. The cheap pads do the job but they wear out fast. You may spend a little more on an Organic at first but it will last much longer.,Jan 2014,Sep 13 2018,3
669,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,13, Organic!!! At first I started with metolius but very soon after went to organic things last forever definitely worth the extra bucks,Nov 2017,Sep 17 2018,2
670,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,14, I rarely boulder right now but when I go I tend to go by myself~ otherwise when I buy a house and move far away from a gym I plan to build a woody. Thus need probably more than the one crash pad I have right now. I have never seen this crash pad but the pink looks sick any thoughts Black Diamond Circuit ? Or would I be better served waiting and buying a tri-fold on sale? This seems like a killer price. I am reopening this thread so if this pad continues to be this cheap~ others can find it.,Jun 2018,Apr 21 2020,0
671,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,15, I'm debating myself whether or not to buy this one as my first pad. Can anyone else offer any suggestions?,Jan 2020,Apr 27 2020,0
672,looking for a good first bouldering crash pad ,1,16, I'm debating myself whether or not to buy this one as my first pad. Can anyone else offer any suggestions?

674,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,0, Just released this year~ has anyone looked at it?,Aug 2013,Mar 10 2020,0
675,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,1, Yeah~ it’s rad! It’s like a textbook of crack climbing technique. It’s super thorough. I’d say my crack climbing skill was decent before reading through the book~ but I’ve learned so much from it as far as different variations on techniques that have improved my abilities a lot. I’d definitely recommend it! ,Feb 2019,Mar 10 2020,3
676,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,2, 304 pages of jamming. Rad. I have not looked at it~ but do have The Crack Climber's Technique Manual: Jamming with Finesse Paperback by Kent Pease and thought it was pretty damn informative at 200+ pages. ,Aug 2017,Mar 10 2020,3

678,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,4, It's pretty darn good in my opinion. helped alot for my wide technique.,Jan 2018,Mar 10 2020,1
679,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,5, It's good.  Super thorough.  Almost better for referencing then attempting to read through entirely.  Which he does state at the beginning.  I really enjoyed The Crack Climber's Technique Manual (probably more in fact).  I read through that entire thing.  But it's less information packed.  I'd say The Crack Climber's Technique Manual by Kent is your notes from like a college course.  And Pete's book is like the textbook you reference when confused about said notes.,Apr 2010,Mar 10 2020,6
680,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,6, Take the book to the crag to reference while trying. You can learn nuggets from the couch but this book is best while out there,May 2017,Mar 10 2020,4
681,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,7, I guess my plan is either to get this or the CCTM and figure out how to really jam on site.  My technique sucks and i always go to laying back which just doesn't get the job done. There's a steep crack climb that absolutely spanked me a couple of summers ago that could be a nice route to throw a solo top rope on until i get dialed in~ but maybe either book would have a better idea of how to get started.,Aug 2013,Mar 10 2020,0
682,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,8," I've only done a single read through~ but I feel it's missing at least a few bits that are in The Crack Climber's Technique Manual. Overall it seems more ""fundamentals"" based~ going deeper into the intricacies of jams~ whereas TCCTM has more of a ""tips and tricks"" feel and focuses more on sequences and full body movement. That's just emphasizing the diferrences though~ they both cover the basics pretty thoroughly.",May 2014,Mar 10 2020,3
683,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,9, +1 for Kent Pease! Be sure to buy it from the publisher (on sale now) or your local shop instead of Amazon. That way you benefit the man instead of The Man!,Mar 2012,Mar 10 2020,9

686,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,12, I have both this and The Crack Climber's Technique Manual.  Both are great~ but Pete's book is way more in depth.  The quality of the illustrations is great in both~ but Pete's takes the cake~ the little arrows indicating how forces are applied in various jams are excellent. The Crack Climber's Technique Manual is like a freshman high school book on cracks~ Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide is like a 300s level college textbook.,Oct 2017,Mar 19 2020,3

691,Crack Climbing: The Definitive Guide (Pete Whitaker),1,17, Has anyone actually done this in real life and gotten it to stick?  I find all of the wide fist extensions pretty silly and usually just go into tight butterflies at that size. I may be wrong (still waiting for my copy of the book in the mail) but I believe this technique is only used to hold body tension/readjust body positioning~ not to actually pull on. ,Jun 2016,Apr 26 2020,4

695,Z4/Z4 Offset inital thoughts/comparison,1,0, Just got some Z4's and Z4 offsets and wanted to provide my initial opinion. This is my first set of offset cams and no I haven't been outside with them (and probably wont for a while) but in the northwest basalt and volcanic rock I assume they will be quite handy. In addition to the offsets~ I got a .5 regular (its what was in stock). After playing with them for a little bit~ bending the stems around~ and looking at the lobes I found some interesting things and would be curious if anyone has something similar on their cams. Keep in mind~ none of these cams have been outside and were unpackaged about an hour ago. .1/.2  trigger: firm and squishy. towards the more cammed end~ the trigger is very stiff lobes:  round on both. the .1 side lobes look hyperextended. the springs on the axle are quite a bit larger in circumference than the axle itself other: not impressed with the trigger~ curious if others have seem similar things on the lobes ,Jan 2019,Apr 22 2020,7
696,Z4/Z4 Offset inital thoughts/comparison,1,1, I've been a fan of my .2/.3~ its slightly larger than the purple/blue Metolius that fits so well in the pnw granite. My trigger has remained stiff despite multiple whips. ,May 2017,Apr 23 2020,2

698,Beal Karma Review,1,0, I'm a not-new but not quite experienced climber looking to buy my first rope (I've been spoiled by a friend group who has had all the gear for a while now) and I'm looking at buying the Beal Karma 9.8 70m rope. I'm looking for an affordable rope I can take trad and sport climbing on lead and some occasional top rope. Any reviews or suggestions? ,Jul 2017,Apr 13 2020,0
699,Beal Karma Review,1,1, I haven’t used that specific Karma rope by Beal~ but I’ve used and abused 2 of their 10.0mm Tiger~ 2 x  9.1mm Joker~ and 1x of their skinny Iceline double ropes and I’ve always been very impressed.  Beal has become my number one rope brand now.,Dec 2013,Apr 17 2020,1
700,Beal Karma Review,1,2, I have that exact rope.  I like it.  2 years in and it's holding up well.   The price was fantastic and the handling qualities are top notch.  ,Feb 2020,Apr 17 2020,2
701,Beal Karma Review,1,3, 9.8 mm is a good diameter for a first rope. Beal is a reputable manufacturer than makes good ropes. An affordable 9.8 from Beal... should be a good choice. ,Jun 2008,Apr 17 2020,2
702,Beal Karma Review,1,4, I have this rope. It does what it’s supposed to do with no problems. Pretty durable too.Ropes get beat up and need to be replaced relatively often if you’re using them a lot. Buy the cheapest rope available at your desired diameter - that’s my 2c. I fell into the trap of buying a $200+ rope with all the bells and whistles. Turns out that I don’t climb when it’s raining. Plus~ I spent more time babying my rope than climbing.I do like a middle marker~ though.,Sep 2017,Apr 21 2020,1
703,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,0, Mammut Revelation 9.2 versus Beal Joker 9.1. I have an Opera 8.5~ so far so good~ not enough time on it to tell. A Mammut Infinity 9.5 that has lasted forever but its time is drawing nigh. Both handle quite well. I will still use my Opera or a half rope for long approach easy stuff. And I have a couple 10mm-ish cords for workhorse use. But the Revelation or Joker will likely be my daily driver for cragging~ and moderate approach multipitch. So which one should I get? Or does the MP hivemind recommend another?,Sep 2014,Apr 8 2019,1
704,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,1, 60m? Beal based on pricehttps://shop.epictv.com/en/products/single-ropes?f%5B0%5D=field_brand%3A1047 sign up for $5 off first purchase too hard to beat those prices (I've bought a few things from them in the last 6 months~ they're legit. Use a credit card with no FOREX fee if you have one~ otherwise figure 3% more),Oct 2010,Apr 8 2019,1
705,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,2, Pricewise~ I can get the Revelation for a bit cheaper than the Beal. I will get a 70m or 80m. I am mainly curious which is the better rope.,Sep 2014,Apr 8 2019,0
706,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,3, I have a Revelation. Typically great Mammut rope. If you like your Infinity 9.5 it's like that~ only thinner and a bit more slippery (mine is dry coated).,Jan 2016,Apr 8 2019,1
707,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,4, I really like my Sterling 9.2 if you're looking for another option. It's called the Evolution Aero.,Aug 2014,Apr 8 2019,1
708,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,5, I do like the idea behind unicore ropes but honestly~ I’ve never owned one. I’m working on changing that. I’ve also never jumped on the Mammut bandwagon like most. In my opinion ( I’ve owned several [infinity~ revelation~ serenity]) they handle well but aren’t as durable as Bluewater Icon (9.1) or Wave (9.3) which are my favorite ropes ever and my only beef with is the sheath slippage.  I’ve almost considered getting a Joker but I always remember that one time a dude unpacked a brand new Beal Joker at the base of the Yellow Spur~ climbed~ fell~ and died after his rope cut. ,Nov 2012,Apr 9 2019,1
709,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,6, I had a Joker that I liked quite a bit—no complaints. It was a very good rope. B+ or A- from me. But I prefer the Mammut lineup for handling and durability. I’ve never been on a rope with better handling.I haven’t used a Revelation~ though~ just an Infinity and an Eternity. My next rope will be the Revelation. Don~ there’s a bit of humor in describing Mammut’s broad fan base as a bandwagon. They’ve been around for~ you know~ a while.   ,unknown,Apr 9 2019,3
710,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,7, I am very disappointed that I was not greeted with a jerry-rigged tension tester that would pull two ropes in series to see which broke first~ possibly with a metal cage over the top giving it that thunder-dome vibe. Again~ I am very disappointed. Misleading title. Need to watch Mad Max.,Jul 2017,Apr 9 2019,3
711,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,8, Wow~ not to derail the thread but do you have a link to more information on that? Ropes cutting and rockfall are two scary things (not saying there was rockfall involved~ just the two things that scare me in rock climbing).,Apr 2015,Apr 9 2019,1
712,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,9, No experience with either but I have been shopping for a similar rope lately and have given some thought to both of these options. It came down to weight for me. In a 70 m the Joker is going to be about 12 ounces lighter. I ruled out the revelation because it's not that much lighter than the infinity. Maybe I'm missing something but trading off the durability advantages of the infinity to go 5 ounces lighter (on a 70m) with the revelation didn't make sense to me. I know every ounce counts but the trade off just didn't seem worth it. ,Jul 2016,Apr 9 2019,0
713,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,10, I have a Revelation and have not been super happy with it:  it started out kinky and never got un-kinky.  In the old days I'd be accused~ rightly or wrongly~ of not properly unwinding it the first time I used it~ but this rope is sold lap coiled or whatever they call it so you apparently don't need to engage in any particular unwinding.  And it feels a bit stiff for my tastes~ although that may be just user preference. Ropes are strange:  it seems that different people have different experiences in terms of kinks~ longevity~ and other characteristics with the same model of rope~ so I'm not surprised that other people have had a different experience with a Revelation~ and I'm not strongly opposed to the rope or anything.  Just of the many ropes I've owned over the years~ I'd put my Revelation on the lower end of how much I like it.  On the other hand~ the two Beal ropes I've owned have probably been my two least favorite ropes :) ,May 2006,Apr 9 2019,0
714,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,11, I recently saw some Infinities on Backcountry.com for about 40% off. Might be worth looking into. ,May 2007,Apr 9 2019,0
715,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,12, I found this but it makes no mention of what rope he was using.  Beal Joker sticks in my mind for some reason.  I'm sure there is an MP thread on it somewhere.,Nov 2012,Apr 9 2019,0

717,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,14, You didn't say what type of climbing you 'll be doing.  I am a huge fan of my Sterling Fusion Ion R 9.4mm for everything except top roping. Kind of a do-it-all rope in a decent weight/diameter.  My buddy has the Sterling Evolution Helix (9.5mm)~ which is almost identical to the Fusion series but claims it is lighter??? I think they are both good ropes.  I have a Sterling Marathon 10.5mm from 1998 that is still going strong~ for non climbing purposes.,Jul 2015,Apr 9 2019,0
718,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,15, Link doesn't work. I believe this is the incident Don Ferris is referring to~ but in the article~ post-accident investigation said it was an abraded slicing of the rope~ possibly a pendulum over an edge which caused the failure. But~ perhaps I'm reading it incorrectly~ so check it out:,Feb 2019,Apr 9 2019,0
719,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,16, Revelation will be more durable~ Joker will be softer catches~ lighter~ and I like the handfeel better. I've been using a Petzl Volta recently~ which is my first experience with Petzl ropes~ and have been pretty impressed. Similar stats to the Revelation~ with higher sheath % and a little lighter. Out of the 3 brands my favorite ropes have come from Beal~ with Petzl making a strong case currently. But any of the options would do you just fine~ as I'm sure you're aware. Still fun to split hairs though. ,Mar 2016,Apr 9 2019,0
720,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,17, In Eldo~ it was definitely a substantial pendulum over a long length of sharp rock that cut the rope.  I would not fault the rope.  No rope could have withstood that.,Apr 2006,Apr 9 2019,0
721,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,18, Per your original question:   I've had both those ropes and absolutely prefer the Joker. In fact the Joker has quickly become one of my favorite ropes I've ever had. Super durable~ and Unicore is pretty awesome.  Generally speaking I do love Mammut ropes~ but I had the same experience as someone else up thread where the Revelation just never broke in the way I wanted it to. ,May 2014,Apr 9 2019,1
722,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,19, I wonder if the Revelations just aren’t as good as the Infinity. I’ve heard several complaints about the former~ none about the latter.,unknown,Apr 9 2019,0
723,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,1,20, Except for maybe a fatter~ tougher rope with a high sheath percentage but yeah I wouldn’t exactly fault the rope here either. I just always think about it when I pull the trigger on a new 9mm lead line.  Unjustifiably puts a bad taste in my mouth. ,Nov 2012,Apr 9 2019,0

725,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,1, I have started using half ropes for most ice climbing. I will be using thicker cords for the couple walls I intend to do this spring/summer. I have a Beal Opera for long approaches and alpine. So this rope will get used for sport and trad that is relatively close to the car~ or longer approaches where I think I have a decent chance of taking some falls~ or anything I need a long cord for (I plan on getting a 70m or 80m). ,Sep 2014,Apr 9 2019,0
726,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,2, I've never owned a Revelation~ but the Infinity is my go-to affordable gold standard and I just bought a joker. I love the joker. It handles really well~ but I'm not sure how long it'll last. That's not to say I don't think it'll last a long time -- it actually feels like it will. I just can't say yet. I had a nondry treated Aero that I loved but I beat the shit out of it and it ended up too short to use pretty quickly. I'd say I get more whips out of the Infinity than I did the Aero~ but that could be any number of thins.,Jan 2016,Apr 10 2019,1
727,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,3, I'm pretty much an aid climber these days~ and a longtime fan of Bluewater. The extra weight of a thicker rope doesn't bother me when I am someplace extremely exposed. ,Apr 2018,Apr 20 2019,0

731,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,7, Just curious~ does anyone ever think about their partners~ when picking ropes? What handles best in the device they are accustomed to? Weight differences and rope stretch? Etc? I don't recall a single comment~ ever... sure~ we should be able to handle anything you put in our hands~ but some ropes are just awful to be stuck with on the nonsharp end. Just a question~ truly! I am a newish climber~ and different ropes have been very ​different to belay with.  My first visit to COR (Castle~ actually) climbing on Poptart is why I bought a 70 for my first rope. It's pretty interesting needing to climb part way up~ to have enough rope to tie in! Best~ Helen,Aug 2015,Apr 21 2019,0
732,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,8," It's a good question~ actually. Maybe starting a new thread is called for~ in fact.  I think if one is thinking about the ropes brought up in this thread it's most likely crossing people's minds. At least you'd know what belay device/s your partner/s have and whether they have a device that meets the criteria for thinner ropes. Maybe you know if they are gear adverse or not and whether they be willing to buy a new belay device~ if needed.  They'd probably be climbing with partners who are willing to go thin or climb with twins and understand what's involved with that~ including how to rappel on them and how thin ropes feed and handle etc. They'd probably have fatter rope/s for use with beginners for sport and TR etc. and save these for more ""advanced"" climbing.  They'd have enough experience to trust who to use these with and who to use something else with (or just not care cause they trust everyone and or have no amygdala.)  They are probably talking about the ropes with their partners~ for buying advice~ before they buy but~ are wanting more advice from the community to help them make a better decision; especially since new ropes come out all the time.  And~ well~ none of this crosses anyone's mind and it gets figured out after the fact. That happens too~ I'm sure. ",Feb 2016,Apr 21 2019,0
733,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,9, Max~ good to know! I have a Mammut Infinity and that thing handles great and wears like iron. Have heard great things about the Serenity~ and have used one~ although I don't own one. I had heard that maybe the Revelation is different construction and isn't as good~ but maybe that isn't the case! Helen~ I do think about partners when buying ropes~ but not too much typically. I give a lot more thought to my partner and their device when picking a rope from the quiver for a given climb. And we communicate about this as well. Relatively speaking~ a lot more money goes into a ropes than belay devices. They cost more initially and wear faster. There are several fun climbs at the City which require shenanigans with a 60m~ but can be rapped or lowered from very simply with a 70 or 80m. Tie a knot! I am really looking forward to climbing there again this fall!,Sep 2014,Apr 21 2019,0
734,Thunderdome: Two Ropes enter~ one rope leaves...,2,10, Sorry~ it looks like this is my week to resurrect old threads. Just wanted to comment here because I've been researching ropes~ and someone else might find this comment the same way I did. I'm pretty sure that Yellow Spur accident was not with a Beal Joker. The accident report (looking at the 15-page PDF version) doesn't name the rope but says it was a 9.7mm Beal. The Joker is 9.1mm~ not 9.7. Also~ the accident report makes no mention of the unicore sheath-to-core bonding technology that the Joker ropes use~ which seems like it would be worthy of mention since protecting the rope from severing in a cutting scenario is unicore's sole purpose. I'm not an expert on this~ but the photos of the damaged climber's rope don't appear to be a unicore rope.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/552e8f43e4b07f0b3920027b/t/566b4b8869a91af72b2a1640/1449872264027/YellowSpur2010v6.pdf Based on the color of the climber's rope in the accident report photos~ I'm thinking it was the Beal Booster Golden Dry~ which does not have unicore. https://www.ems.com/beal-booster-9.7-mm-x-60-m-golden-dry-climbing-rope/1313089.html  Note - the report specifically says there's no reason to believe this rope was flawed or more susceptible to cutting than other normal ropes. It was just a terribly unlucky scenario where the rope got pinched while the climber pendulumed~ sliding the weighted rope across an edge. ,Apr 2014,Apr 19 2020,0

737,journey mattress,1,1, Thanks for the tip. Looks like a one-product company. Had never heard of them before. Just wrote them~ suggesting they offer a short~ but wide version.,Nov 2009,Apr 15 2020,0
738,journey mattress,1,2, I have never had great luck with these light inflatable type pads. I use a Paco pad in my truck~ and a regular thermarest when backpacking. I had a Klymit that leaked after four nights in a basecamp setting~ I would not trust my life to an inflatable pad in any sort of alpine environment. ,Jul 2019,Apr 16 2020,0
739,journey mattress,1,3, Might be an ok cheap pad. See below for a rambling opinion.The biggest thing that would turn me off of it is the lack of an R value/any insulation info. It just says “no heat loss” which is just a false statement. Also~ as a side sleeper these ultra thin pads are a nightmare. I do really like the integral pillow idea though. Overall take: it’s probably a mass produced import. That being said it might be great!

744,journey mattress,1,8," Looks like a poor design in my opinion. All those areas in between the raised ""bubbles"" will leak heat. Klymit pads do this too~ it's why they're never as warm as their R value suggests compared to eg Thermarest. Think of a box baffled VS sewn thru down jacket. Klymit always claimed your sleeping bag lofted and filled in the gaps but that's wishful thinking. ",Sep 2013,Apr 16 2020,0

747,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,0, Has anyone had a chance to try these out? I'm wondering how well they penetrate ice being only 480 grams? Also~ is the fully carbon handle suspect to breaking if dropped while mixed climbing?

748,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,1, Unless someone managed a demo last season it will still be a bit before anyone can give feedback. I checked with Liberty Mountain (distributor for grivel) last week and they hadn't received them yet.

749,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,2," I've been trying to get my hands on a pair too. US distributor still doesn't have them~ they told me they expect a limited ""first batch"" soon but no dates and can't say which retailers they'll go to. UK distributor received them today~ should be in stores there 1-2 weeks. I'll order from across the pond if there are no news stateside by Black Friday.  I'm psyched to try them. I've had rotator cuff issues on both sides~ hoping the light weight is kinder. The North Machines (also light) are much easier to swing than my Petzl tools though I haven't used them on enough cold~ brittle ice to comment on penetration.",Sep 2013,Nov 15 2019,0

That being said~ I'm sure the ice climbing tools are built to a different standard. They seem hefty for carbon fiber. ,Mar 2014,Dec 5 2019,0
758,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,11, Liberty Mountain had a note of 12-6 ETA on the dark machines for a bit now~ logged in today and 0 quantity shows and the eta note is gone. This was the response back I had from them in early November: We have some Dark Machines coming in stock in the next couple weeks~ but not our full shipment of them so I’m not sure how many will still be available after our pre-orders are shipped out. I know that’s not a great answer~ we will be receiving more in after the initial shipment but we do not have the ETA yet for the remainder. My best advice would be to check in a couple weeks to see if we have any after the preorders have gone out.,Jan 2015,Dec 6 2019,2

760,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,13, I'm not sure what to think of these stories of carbon tools breaking. Grivel use to make a tool called the Carbon Race (maybe Monster Race)~ there's even a video on youtube with Steve House soloing some climbs back east. Also~ Grivel isn't the first to make all carbon tools; Eliteclimb(Polish) and Icerock(Russian) have been at it for awhile. Also~ weren't some of the later generation Lowe Alpine Big Bird and Hummingbirds available with carbon shafts? But~But~ if one has ever cruised Neptune's in Boulder~ what about all those broken tools being used for benches? I think aluminum is used primarily because it's cheap~ pliable and light;another curious thing is why would BD use stainless on their old Reactors? I have an Eliteclimb Salamandra; incredibly light~ and so far~ so good. I also have an Icerock Idol~ (carbon)which is just too beautiful to take out and bash. Both of these tools are UIAA rated.,Mar 2014,Dec 11 2019,1

763,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,16, Got a chance to put a couple of pitch's on the Dark Machines last week. They swing and penetrate great. The center of balance is much closer to the head than other tools so it feels like you are swinging a tool with pick weights on it but they carry much lighter. Hope that makes sense. I was impressed. Highly probability it will be my next tool.,Jul 2016,Dec 19 2019,2
764,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,1,17, The ice screw sculpture was made from donated Ti screws from (probably) Ushba and they were twisted and bent by Jeff Skoloda an artistic welder in Ouray.

769,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,1, I got a chance to fondle and swing the tools at Ouray Mountain Sports.  Here are my initial thoughts. Despite the relatively low overall weight~ the swing feels head heavy~ more similar to a Nomic with head weights than either the Tech Machine or North Machine Carbon.  The tool rotates easily around the pinky finger.  There is no “cup” or trigger to facilitate rotating the tool around the index finger.  The handle is long and should accommodate any hand width comfortably.The front of the lower handle is very wide and flat (very similar width and shape to the Petzl Ergonomic).  I have the Ergonomics and personally do not like the wide~ flat front of the lower handle.  I prefer the narrower / more rounded lower handles of the North Machine Carbon~ Nomic~ Tech Machine~ and X-Dream.  The upper grip position with over molded rubber is very comfortable and the tools feel very nimble and easy to control~ when using the secondary grip.  In my opinion~ this feels like the best upper grip on the market.  I wish Grivel had used the same geometry and rubber on the lower handle.TL/DR: The Dark Machine seems like it will be a great option for both ice and mixed climbing~ if you like the relatively wide and flat shape of the lower handle.  ,Aug 2013,Dec 20 2019,2
770,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,2, I'm based in the UK and have just replaced my battered metal shafted tech machines. The only flaw with the Techs was the handle as it was too small and the rubber grips on my pair were failing. Grivel have addressed this with the Darks~ the carbon handle has perfect clearance and geometry. The handle certainly feels sturdy enough and overall integrity feels first class. During two days use in Scotland I encountered no issues with any aspect of the design and certainly no flex or creaking from the carbon handle. I haven't had a chance to play around with the modular head/adze/hammer combo but I've reason to suspect they'll work flawlessly.

777,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,9, Further update..........Just had a further two days in Scotland with my Dark Machines on Minus Three Gully and Minus Two Gully. I'm very impressed with what Grivel have done with these. Great Geometry and clearance with superb picks and build quality.  Top tip.........Used the retro fit hammers and I would suggest the Micro Hammers over the heavier weight Hammers. As well as making the tools more versatile~ they add a little head weight without affecting the swing.   ,Apr 2018,Feb 21 2020,1

781,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,13, I've had a couple days on Dark Machines in the Northeast. Overall I'm psyched~ like I mentioned previously I've struggled with shoulder issues and I think with hundreds of swings in a day the light weight really helps me. That said my impression is that (predictably) Petzls with pick weights and Pur'ice picks (factory setup on the latest Nomics) do penetrate cold/brittle ice better. Definitely bounced in a couple of spots that I don't think my Nomics would have. I wouldn't necessarily bring the Nomics instead because for me over the course of a typical day I think the Grivels are a net plus~ but in some spots you might miss the Petzls. I will try the Grivel total ice vario picks when I find some~ that may be next season though. Edit: just want to add that they are very well balanced and the weight is appropriately biased towards the head. It's not a balance issue (like on a set of Petzls if you remove the pick weights). On most ice the Grivels are magic~ there just comes a point where the ice sucks and more weight helps. If you've climbed on a set of North Machines they're very similar~ these just have a nice handle to hang onto for steep stuff. ,Sep 2013,Mar 14 2020,3
782,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,14, Thoughts on X vs. non-X? What I've compiled so far:,Sep 2014,Mar 14 2020,0
783,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,15, I've had my hands on the X but haven't actually climbed on it. Have you ever used a tool with that aggressive of a handle/angle? What kind of mixed are you thinking of? I would have to be climbing pretty steep rock regularly and very little else to consider it over the regular DM which is a better rounded tool. With that said it's very personal and I've met competent climbers who have been doing everything including easy ice with Petzl Ergos (by choice) for years. See if you can put hands on the X's in a shop at least~ or maybe swing a friend's similarly aggressive tools (X dreams~ Ergonomics). ,Sep 2013,Mar 14 2020,1
784,Grivel Dark Machine ice tools,2,16, In the US~ you can call Grivel's distributor Liberty Mountain.  They have a pretty good idea about where/when stock is located.

787,Arc'teryx Warranty shit the bed?,1,0," Question here~ has anyone else experienced a change in attitude by Arc'teryx in their evaluation of gear for warranty repair and replacement since they started their used gear sales offerings?  In my prior experience they would either repair or replace gear that had obviously failed as a result of construction as opposed to mis-use (the core vent zippers on my Alpha SV delaminated and detached from the body of the shell).  Now they seem to involve an arbitrary Practical Product Lifespan standard and offer to sell replacement gear at 50% or wholesale.  To me~ this change uncannily coincides with their offering to sell used gear.  Are they monetizing this on the backs of their loyal customers by offering a ""deal"" at 50% off retail and then repairing and reselling the equipment.  My cynical suspicions tell me that they are.  I guess if I acquire more Act'teryx shells~ I will need to go over the ""welding"" with a healthy dose of aqua seal (just like the old tents) to make sure the gear doesn't fail in the middle of some gnar.....",Jan 2020,Jan 24 2020,1

As far as Patagonia goes~ I brought in a pair of jeans that were worn through in the butt and a knee asking if they'd be able to repair them. They weren't but gave me a gift card for what I paid for them. They've also fixed small issues on my wife's fleece jacket like missing buttons~ burn holes~ etc. I'm pretty confident in them.,Aug 2013,Feb 22 2020,1
801,Arc'teryx Warranty shit the bed?,1,14, My old Kata 45 had some broken buckles and one shoulder strap was starting to tear out. I took it in and they offered to repair it (weeks away) or send me a new one of equivalent value so I picked the Alpha AR 55.

804,Arc'teryx Warranty shit the bed?,1,17, to add to the discussion: I just warrantied my old~ used but not abused Theta AR that had delamed around the wrist and the waist pull cord. They offered to repair or replace it without a hitch. took a some time but otherwise no other issues,May 2013,Mar 19 2020,1
805,Arc'teryx Warranty shit the bed?,1,18," I have bought~ used~  thrashed~ worn out and torn up~ quite a bit of Arcteryx (and many other brands’!) gear over the years. Warranty on most used to be amazing - no questions asked~ pretty much. More recently~ here is how I would characterize my experience in the past couple years or so with a sample of a few: Patagonia: ""Of course! We are so delighted that you are a customer and totally stand behind our gear. We can repair this one for you~ that one is too badly abused~ so we'll replace it~ and this one is 20 years old and has lived a great life~ so we'll give you some reasonably prorated store credit for it."" OR:  [I send in pictures. Warranty guy thinks to himself: Dude~ clearly you thrashed these gloves and let's be real~ they are mixed climbing gloves with pittards and you did a lot of rappelling in them and that's not the intended use.] And writes ""Those look pretty worn. But if you haven't had them for very long why don't you send those in and we can have a look at them."" I read his thoughts and respond ""No worries~ thanks for taking a look. I'm good and I’ll just buy a new pair."" A new pair of gloves shows up the next week~ to my great surprise. Arcteryx: ""Well~ we'll repair or replace it~ but only grudgingly and with a 6-12 week wait~ and don't forget we're doing you a huge favor and I'm making an exception this time."" [Just my sense of the attitude of the reps I've engaged with over email~ almost like they are trying to signal to me to back off on my warranty inquiries. But I may be overly sensitive on this.]",Dec 2015,Mar 19 2020,3
806,Arc'teryx Warranty shit the bed?,1,19, It's important to acknowledge that these companies have no obligation to stand behind their gear in what I would see as far above and beyond expectations in any other sport or activity I've been involved with. My comments above are solidly #firstworldproblems and I receive all of the repaired or replaced goods with some sense of amazement and gratitude every time. That said~ the warranty these companies explicitly promise~ and the reputation they gain for interpreting their own policies loosely and generously~ is I believe part of their offering~ and part of how they justify a significant price premium. Also~ it's good business for them to keep the hard core users/influencers happy since so much of what they sell including technical gear goes to light hikers~ around town users~ or light volume users. For my part~ I pay the price premium because I like pimped out gear~ but I do so with the expectation that it will last~ sometimes through multiple patches and incarnations.  I would guess that Arcteryx has been bought by a big conglomerate or something in recent years~ and serves its investors as much as it does its core users now~ but that's speculation. ,Dec 2015,Mar 19 2020,4

808,2 way satellite messengers,1,0," Hey all With some of the recent threads about rescues and the AAC podcast encouraging a 2 way system rather than a ""push button and hope"" I've been thinking to upgrade.  I have an older spot device (v3 i think) with the non 2 way functionality.  I know spot have a 2 way now~ but I was leaning towards inreach because it sounded like their network was better.  I then noticed there was also a new garmin G66i~ this seems like the future for garmin to integrate inreach functionality into more of their existing GPS lines.  SO it seems like: Inreach Mini $350 + sub - Requires phone to text message - I don't like to rely on a 2nd piece of hardware that may run out of batteries or break.   Inreach Explorer + $450 +sub - Gives you everything the mini does plus poor GPS/mapping functionality and I believe you can still message albeit slowly without using the app? Garmin G66i $600 + sub - seems to combine the inreach explorer + functionality into a possibly better GPS Is this fair? Can you actually text with just the explorer+ if your phone is dead?  Also has anyone tried the new garmin unit?  Is the GPS decent as a standalone?  Is the inreach functionality the same?  I have an old  garmin oregon but it goes through batteries and the screen is dreadful so it might be nice to combine functionality and get rid of that.",Nov 2017,Aug 23 2019,2
809,2 way satellite messengers,1,1, You can text on the mini without a phone~ it is just tedious. Since I always have a phone with me and could go without in an emergency~ I find Iran acceptable compromise.,Dec 2009,Aug 23 2019,1
810,2 way satellite messengers,1,2, You can text with the Explorer + using the toggle.  It's not as fast as using a phone~ but it is decent.  Also~ the maps/GPS capabilities on the + aren't bad~ depending on what you want. I bought mine as an emergency device~ and limit its use (e.g. off on a 43 day remote trip--I did not want to use up its batteries).  I used a Garmin eTrex 20 for GPSing~ but we used maps for the trip--GPS was for befuddlement and entertainment (e.g. how fast were we sailing?). ,Mar 2016,Aug 23 2019,0
811,2 way satellite messengers,1,3," Simon~ you can text from the Inreach Mini without a phone. I have one and really like it. You can set up preset messages like ""I'm safely in camp""~ or ""Made the summit"" or ""Running late~ don't worry"" that shortcut a lot of the tedious entering of letters. It also has a preset ""yes"" and ""no"" so in an emergency you can easily answer questions from emergency services folks who are texting with you.  The think with both the Explorer + and the new G66 is that they pretty much suck as navigation devices compared to just using an iPhone or a an Android phone with GaiaGPS or Garmin's own software~ Earthmate. My system is that I use an iphone (in airplane mode most of the time) running GaiaGPS for my navigation app. The Inreach Mini is just clipped to my backpack or harness in case of an oh-shit emergency. And it's nice~ when in the backcountry~ to be able to type out a text to my wife right from the phone and send it via the Inreach system.  I have the $11 per month subscription and find it to be more than adequate. ",Jan 2016,Aug 23 2019,5
812,2 way satellite messengers,1,4, Inreach mini saved me from paying for a helicopter rescue in the alps this year~ was overdue and my roommate got concerned so he went and contacted the mountain rescue folks but eventually I was able to get in touch with him and tell him while I'm an idiot I am in fact safe. I tend to use my inreach about once every 1.5 months~ generally to tell someone hey I'm not going to be home tonight but I am okay. The $11 a month kills it for piece of mind. I wouldn't want the bigger inreach because as others have said their mapping abilities are meh compared to a phone~ but it certainly has given me piece of mind both in the moments where I knew I was okay but people may be worrying about me~ and the fewer moments where I wasn't sure if everything was going to be okay.,Sep 2017,Aug 23 2019,2

814,2 way satellite messengers,1,6, I recently was on a backpacking trip where we went 18 miles in to the base of the blue glacier at the base of mount Olympus in Washington. As we set up camp my buddies wife texted me via in-reach that her dad just had a massive heart attack. We bailed out the next morning and am NEVER going without an in reach again. Even on day hikes that thing is on and tracking and someone knows how to track me and my plans. It’s 2019 and there is no reason to be out without something in my opinion. Not at least for me. I understand the soloist mentality but if I don’t return home after a trip~ the entire trip was a failure. Summit or not my life is more important and so is my entire team. ,Sep 2016,Aug 31 2019,5
815,2 way satellite messengers,1,7, For anyone else looking for a device don't overlook the Somewear Labs device.  It's a super simple locator device that pairs with your phone that allows you to text.  The device by itself has an SOS function but you need a phone for texting.   I have had the Spot and InReach.  The InReach has more bells and whistles but the Somewear is cheaper and has been more reliable than the InReach.  My InReach was spotty in the sense of getting messages out~ it didn't have to do with signal it turned out to be more software related.  Anyway the Somwear Labs device has been great and is worth a consideration.,Apr 2012,Sep 3 2019,0

817,BD Stance Belay - anyone try out the new version?,1,0, Been wanting to buy one~ and then I saw all these reviews about quality control issues. I see they've updated it this year and I'm wondering if anyone has tried out the latest version? I know they switched the insulation too. Thanks for reading! ,Dec 2017,Oct 16 2019,1
818,BD Stance Belay - anyone try out the new version?,1,1, Just got the new version yesterday~ just called the “Belay parka”  It’s a nice coat but i think i’m going to send it back. it’s too heavy and too bulky for me. But i do long distance stuff and weight/pack space is important to me. As far as the warmth it’s toasty. the insulation in it is dense and not “puffy” like down. it packs down to a small sleeping bag and is 12oz heavier than my Pat hyper puff. It’s a Slick looking parka though~ HUGE hood and covers your ass. hope this helps,Mar 2020,Mar 19 2020,0
819,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,0, Any La Sportiva Testarossa devotees out there try out the redesign?  If so~ do you like it?  Sizing the same? How's the new heel? Thanks.,Feb 2018,May 16 2019,2
820,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,1, I haven’t climbed in them yet~ but I have tried them on~ and I was very happy with how they felt.  I have been wearing testarossas forever~ and was very apprehensive about the change~ but now I’m cautiously optimistic.  I tried the same size as my old ones~ and they felt right. The biggest difference is the heel~ it is much stiffer now~ but it also felt smaller~ somewhat less incut on the Achilles’ tendon~ and for me this was a good thing.  My current pair of old-style testarossas is only two months old~ so I probably won’t be buying a new pair until the fall. Maybe by then I’ll get to try them on a shoe demo~ there is usually one at the rocktoberfest~ so dear La Sportiva rep~ if you are reading this~ please have a pair in size 36? Please? ;),Mar 2011,May 16 2019,0
821,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,2, They are my favorite shoe~ but I’ve never been crazy about the squishy heal. The new version made the shoe complete~ imo. However~ if you liked the old heal~ it may not be an improvement for you. Sizing-wise I found it to be the same~ maybe a tad tad tad bigger (Less than 1/4 size).  I wouldn’t size any differently. The new heal is very similar to the Genius. Great shoe that got even better~ go get’em!,Sep 2014,May 16 2019,1
822,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,3, Just spotted this: https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNtKNOn2C4/ La Sportiva saying to downsize a half size further from your old Testarossa size.  Ugh.  Why oh why do they insist in changing what was already great??  I actually love the heel the way it is.,Feb 2018,May 17 2019,1
823,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,4, Just try it~ I was saying the same thing~ the old heel was just fine! I expected to dislike the new heel~ but didn’t.,Mar 2011,May 17 2019,0
824,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,5," Bought a pair simply to try them on and see how they compared~ side by side~ to a brand new pair of ""old"" Testarossas~ and low and behold~ they are very different.  The new ones fit about a quarter size larger~ which sort of f****s me over because a half size smaller will be impossible to get into~ and excruciating even if I can get into them~ and the current size is just slightly too big.  Also~ the new heel is exactly like the Genius~ which I think sucks.  F*** YOU~ LA SPORTIVA! Guess I'll be stocking up on old pairs anywhere I can find them.  ",Feb 2018,May 17 2019,1
825,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,6, Weird~ it felt different than Genius heel to me... I   anyway~ good luck finding the old ones. Hopefully you are one of those less-in-demand sizes. 2 months ago GearExpress was the only online source that had my size. Weirdly enough~ they seem to be the only retailers that haven’t discounted old model of testarossas... they still list them for $180...,Mar 2011,May 17 2019,0
826,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,7, Luckily there are a few pairs of the old version floating around the net in my size (43.5) ~ no deep discount~ though~ which is a bummer.  Have you ever resoled a pair?  I never have.  Perhaps I will have to now.  If so~ how have they taken to one?,Feb 2018,May 17 2019,0
827,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,8, I've had a couple pair of old version Testarossas resoled.  They're a very soft shoe~ sensitive~ so you have to send them in very early~ pretty much as soon as the rand peaks down the sole line -- otherwise I doubt you'll be happy with their future performance.,May 2011,May 17 2019,2
828,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,9, I have resoled  my very first pair of testarossas~ and was disappointed. I felt that the shoe completely changed shape~ even though I did send it to a resoler recommended by la Sportiva. I have not bothered resoling since then. But that was 10 years ago~ things may have changed since then. ,Mar 2011,May 17 2019,1
829,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,10, Just bought a pair of the new ones~ in the same size as the red-and-yellows. I stocked up on the old ones because I was paranoid about the redesign~ but I think that was unnecessary. It seems to fit the same in the forefoot. The heel is more snug~ which I like. I'll have to spend some time using them to know if the heel performance is better or not~ since I liked the old one just fine. To the resole question~ my one resoled pair is 95% as good as a new pair. They did stiffen up just slightly~ in a way that doesn't hurt performance but does hurt comfort.,Jul 2015,May 17 2019,2
830,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,11, 2 full resoles on my old testarossas from rock and resole. Downturn and fit are like new,Mar 2016,May 17 2019,2
831,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,12, They still had a good bump up under the big toe on the resole? I've got 4 pairs of the old style stock piled~ but eventually they'll wear out. I love the original since I have bone spurs (haglunds deformity) that get painful pressure from stiff heel cups.,Jan 2015,May 24 2019,0

833,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,14, After wearing my black/red pair for a day~ I feel like they might be a bit bigger than the red/yellow. They definitely have less-pronounced heel tension. I'm not unhappy with them at all but next time I need a new pair I'll at least try a half size smaller.,Jul 2015,May 27 2019,1
834,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,1,15, I can confirm~ after trying both 43.5 and 43 (my size in the old Testarossa is 43.5) that they run approximately 1/4-1/2 size bigger. Closer to 1/4 size~ with my foot. Will be buying 43's in the new version~ and they'll definitely be more painful.  Oh well.  ,Feb 2018,May 27 2019,0

I found the Genius very difficult to fit as compared to the new ones on the testerossa.

I am debating about going half a size down as is being recommended~ but my issue has always been a wider forefoot. I wear 40s in the old model~ and the heel is already a bit loose. Based on what's being said I'm afraid going 40 in the new model will leave way too much space in the heel and going 39.5 will leave me with too little in front. ,Oct 2015,Jun 4 2019,0

Would concur with others IE they run bigger now I wore 36.5 in the old originals these I would guess would be equal to the 36 in the new version.I bought these in 36.5 and have used them quite a lot. They seem great.I have a narrow forefoot but medium/wide middle and narrow heel..Up sizing works but downsizing in the new sizing does as well.,Feb 2018,Jun 5 2019,0
846,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,2,6, Thanks David. Okay~ since consensus seems to be that they are about half a size larger than the old version~ I went ahead and ordered a 39.5. Wish I could try them on first~ but they aren't available in the country I'm in at the moment but also got a pair of the old ones in my normal size as insurance.,Oct 2015,Jun 11 2019,1
847,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,2,7," Hello!  Did anyone downsize a 1/2 size (EU) and find they were still too long? I wear a 41.5 in the original and they fit perfectly~ but a 41 in the new model is definitely too long for my feet. From the sportiva instagram post referenced earlier in the thread they suggested an ""extra 1/2 size"" which would seem to imply downsizing 2 half-sizes~ given the use of ""extra"". However~ after reading this thread a 1/2 size smaller was what a few people said fit best. I didn't want to risk going down too small as I ordered them online and also wanted a slightly bigger pair for long days outdoors - so worst case scenario I have that bigger pair. Which is the case. Now to find the size that would match the fit of the originals. If anyone has a 40~ 40.5~ and/or 41 and can measure them in centimetres that would be most helpful. Highly unlikely my 41s were mislabled as a 41 but a length comparison would be great. Also~ anyone notice that they seem ever so slightly less downturned? unless the added length creates an optical illusion lol.    thanks!",Jul 2019,Jul 16 2019,0
848,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,2,8, I interpreted the IG post as going down .5 EU size from your old model size.  Since I wore a 41 in old model~ I bought the new model in 41 and 40.5 to try out.  Comparing the two new models both visually and by fit~ 40.5 is shorter.   My experience: New model 41 was a bit loose/long straight out of the box.  40.5 started off tight~ but has broken in.  It is tighter than my old model 41 still~ but nothing crazy.  The heel is much better/more snug.  I agree~ the new model does look less downturned.,Feb 2014,Jul 17 2019,0
849,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,2,9, I would agree with everything here in terms of sizing. I wear a 43.5 in the old version and a 43 in the new version. It’s certainly tighter than the old 43.5~ but not to the same degree that an old 43 would’ve been. I still prefer the old heel~ the old colors~ and the old sizing~ but I guess this is what we’re stuck with. I think the stiffness of the heel makes the shoe appear less downturned~ whereas before it just flopped down. ,Feb 2018,Jul 17 2019,0

852,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,2,12, I picked up the 40.5 and they fit a wee bit tighter (on my left foot) than my 41.5 OGs when new~ but feel like they're close to becoming a perfect fit after a few routes indoors. I think?!?!  Right foot feels perfect'ish; left foot soso'ish. They're still in that kind-of too painful/too stiff break-in period so fingers crossed they fit even better than the OGs after a week of climbing. Thankfully~ the 41s (new model) are great for outdoors when my feet swell up and the 41.5 OGs become too tight for my sore toes.,Jul 2019,Jul 30 2019,0
853,2019 La Sportiva Testarossa,2,13," I read it as you did at first (and in relation to this thread) but they didn't say go down a .5 EU size~ they said an ""extra .5 size"" which could have been a colloquialism but if you care to indulge my nerdiness for a moment~ no need to say extra imo lol - either way~ the 41s turned out to be a worthwhile buy as they come through outdoors when needed.  I love the OGs but the wee bit tighter feel of the NMs may prove to be a winner after they've broken in. Good luck to every ones feet! And that can be said when purchasing: indoor vs outdoor use. I can climb all day indoors and there's not much change to how my shoes feel. Outdoors and the OGs can become too painful to wear. ",Jul 2019,Jul 30 2019,0

862,Went solo hiking in NZ a few weeks ago and fell in love... Planning a mountaineering trip this winter and advice sorely needed!,1,0, Hey guys~ So I'm looking to get into some serious mountaineering after doing some fun alpine hiking in NZ a few weeks ago. I'm an experienced climber and do all sorts of other activities (canyoning~ caving etc) but this NZ trip was my first taste of actual mountains and I just want more...​https://testmyspeed.onl/​​​ A guided tour would be a fantastic intro~ such as from NZAC however they 1) don't run in winter 2) are expensive (even though i'm aware that they’re the cheapest option - I’m a student alright haha). This leads me onto my main question: what do I need to do to meet the people that could teach m e the skills necessary to navigate the mountains? I’m willing to be the pack horse of a group just to get into the mountains and learn… ​https://xender.vip/​​​ I have a month off from June-July so I plan on spending as much as that time in the NZ alpine gaining experience and alpine knowledge. I’ve been reading books (mountaineering: freedom of the hills~ Training for the new alpinism) however nothing beats 101 face time with an experienced person to tell you what you missed~ what you’re doing wrong~ how to improve… I can use crampons and self arrest~ do anything climbing related rope work etc~ however I specifically lack snow/glacier travel knowledge and anything that’s mountaineering specific... I love hiking and climbing (most notably solo)~ the adventure~ pure hardship and independence; I want to push myself this winter and climb some bloody amazing mountains! However~ I also don't love dying so I’d love to hear all of your advice on how I can achieve these short term goals over the coming months! If you have literally any sort of advice you’d like to share~ I'd love to hear it; Cheers!https://19216811.cam/,Mar 2020,Mar 6 2020,0
863,Went solo hiking in NZ a few weeks ago and fell in love... Planning a mountaineering trip this winter and advice sorely needed!,1,1, If you are in New Zealand~ just join a climbing/tramping (aka hiking) club. They tend to run regular trips~ with a lot of people developing their skills there. Many even run their own intro to snow courses over the winter. Try either the NZAC~ CMC~ the university tramping/climbing clubs~ or your local tramping club. Harder tramping in NZ blends into easy mountaineering~ and there's a fair amount of overlap in outdoor skills.,Feb 2020,Mar 9 2020,0

865,MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna,1,0, When looking at MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna~ they both look very similar. Yes~ you enter the end from different side~ but overall structure is similar.  Is it safe to assume that both tents would perform the same as a 4-season tent?,Jun 2019,Mar 5 2020,0
866,MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna,1,1, One is a 3 pound single wall tent and the other is a 5 pound double wall~ so pretty different in those ways. I have the Unna and like it~ but actually would prefer the Advance pro for most of my climbing goals. I think the Unna is better for base camp style whereas the AP2 I'm guessing would be better for alpine style pushes where you're carrying your tent up routes. ,Aug 2015,Mar 5 2020,0
867,MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna,1,2, Thanks for the reply.  One last question.  What is your opinion about choosing Unna or Advance Pro for Denali West Buttress expedition?  Also~ how would you compare Hilleberg Soulo and Advance Pro?  Soulo has three poles~ where Advance Pro only two.  Do you feel strength of the Advance would be enough for the wether conditions on Denali?,Jun 2019,Mar 6 2020,0
868,MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna,1,3, I would recommend neither tent for a Denali trip as they are very small and not very enjoyable for waiting out storms.   I hope you aren't planning on climbing Denali solo as the lower Kahiltna glacier is very heavily crevassed.,Mar 2008,Mar 6 2020,1
869,MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna,1,4, It's not a solo West Buttress Expedition~ I'm just solo in a tent.   I have three tents/options: Option 1:https://www.msrgear.com/tents/all-season-tents/advance-pro-2-ultralight-2-person-4-season-tent/13110.html Option 2:https://hilleberg.com/eng/tent/red-label-tents/soulo/ Option 3:  https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/82300156/katabatic-2-tent?sp=1&color=Limeade&size=ONE%20SIZE Advance and Soulo are both light and strong and since I will be solo in a tent only~ I feel that one of those will work.,Jun 2019,Mar 6 2020,0
870,MSR Advance Pro 2 and Hilleberg Unna,1,5, If you're intent on using one of those three~ I would get the Unna and upgrade to 10mm poles. It's roomier then the Soulo. The single wall MSR would be silly. ,Sep 2013,Mar 6 2020,0

873,Black Diamond Z4,4,0, How do they compare to Dragonflies and Totems?,Aug 2019,Jan 27 2020,0
874,Black Diamond Z4,4,1,,Apr 2013,Jan 27 2020,5
875,Black Diamond Z4,4,2, They are very similar to dragonflies. They are not yet totems because the 2 sides of lobes arent independently loaded like the totem. I’d say biggest benefit of Z4’s are weight~ grip power (from the soft metal on the lobes)~ and #1 benefit is that they won’t walk as much as the cams they replace. They also have the G-factor and look cool,Jan 2018,Feb 21 2020,0
876,Black Diamond Z4,4,3, I've never placed DMM dragonflies~ but I've worked extensively with X4s and Alien Revolutions.  I now own a set of the Z4s and have placed them a few dozen times.  I am all in with the Z4s for several reasons~ although the Aliens are a close second.   The Black Diamond Z4s are much lighter than X4s and Dragonflies.  Aliens are slightly lighter~ but the difference is negligible.  However~ you get greater durability with the Z4s over the aliens~ and you also get the double axel down to 0.3.  DMM dragonflies have a smaller range than both Z4s~ X4s~ and Aliens.  Aliens have the greatest range of them all~ but BD microcams are close.   The Z4s have the new trigger system that stiffens up the cam while placing and loosens up when released to provide greater holding power for horizontal placements and for reducing walk potential.  This actually works and the difference is noticeable. The Z4s have pretty solid construction.  The lobes are softer than the X4s~ which provides greater grip in placements.  The aliens have even softer aluminum~ but to a fault; alien cams become deformed easily.  I've heard people are having problems with the springs and trigger action with their DMMs.  Although I haven't used my Z4s for very long~ I believe this won't be an issue.  The plastic around the trigger of the Z4s seems solid and ample in providing protection to the stem/trigger system. The Z4s have a single sling.  This is largely preference~ but I prefer the simplicity and don't like fumbling with a double sling.  It doesn't seem to reduce the need for alpine draws.   Lastly~ the Z4s are cheaper than the dragonflies~ X4s~ and Aliens.  For now~ I think it is the best microcam on the market.  But we'll have to wait and see what Wild Country comes up with.   Totems are a whole other animal.  They are expensive~ heavy~ awkward~ and more difficult to clean.  However~ friends swear by them.  The independent loading can remove the need for offsets~ but I  don't know if the holding power is better than a well placed offset.  And for parallel placements~ I'm just not sure the holding power is much better than any other microcam to justify the cons.   Disclaimer: I haven't fallen on a Z4 yet.  Maybe the cam will reveal its faults after I do.  ,Jun 2017,Mar 3 2020,5
877,Black Diamond Z4,4,4, Listening to you let's us believe the Totem is the deepest shitty cam while it's the best. ,Sep 2016,Mar 4 2020,7
878,Black Diamond Z4,4,5, I just got the smallest one~ it’s more in line with a C3 in head-width and is small. Getting that inject the pro in the crack ninja feeling y’alls.,Sep 2005,Mar 4 2020,0
879,Black Diamond Z4,4,6,  Every other cam seems to run 25% off deals on independent websites~ making the totem roughly $40 more.  Either way~ its $20 more than a Z4.  ,Jun 2017,Mar 5 2020,0
880,Black Diamond Z4,4,7, C3. RIP.  ,Jul 2011,Mar 5 2020,0
881,Black Diamond Z4,4,8, Every other cam seems to run 25% off deals on independent websites~ making the totem roughly $40 more.  Either way~ its $20 more than a Z4.   This person obviously doesnt use Totems. All of the negatives he's stated are untrue. They arent awkward~ they're ABSOLUTELY the easiest cam to clean becasue of their lobe shape~ and they're one of the few cams that can be placed easily with winter gloves on. Opinions are opinions~ but this is an odd takeaway to have~ and is the exact opposite of everything I think about them.,Sep 2017,Mar 5 2020,4
882,Needing advice: Black Static and dynamic rope middle markers,1,0, Hey everyone! A buddy and I split 200m of static rope and cut it in half. I’m wanting to make a mark in the middle of the rope but am not sure what the best way to go about it would be? The rope is black so most of the solutions I’ve seen online won’t work as well as I would hope.  I’ve seen tape and buying specialty markers as to not damage the rope. The tape idea could work for a short time but It will eventually come undone as it moves through metal and across Rock. And I’m sure we wouldn’t be able to see the dye.Has anyone done anything that has worked well for them? Open to all ideas. With that being said I also have a rope that has been used pretty much exclusively for top rope and the middle marks have become faded. I was going to mark it with a dye or specialty marker but also wanted to know if anyone has done anything that worked really well for them. I’m assuming marking dynamic and static would be different.  Please let me know! Thank you all!,Jan 2018,Feb 20 2020,0

887,Acopa Spectres,1,0, TL~DR I’d describe the Acopa Spectres as well-balanced. Edge well~ smear well~ heel hook well. Quickest break in of any shoe I’ve had~ and immediately comfortable.  I love the aesthetics and build quality.,Jul 2009,Jan 25 2020,3
888,Acopa Spectres,1,1, Quick update I’ve now climbed 18 pitches in the shoes~ from 10d-13b~ all around vertical sport climbing.  The combination of edging and sensitivity is holding true~ they have broken in nicely without excess stretch. A lot of my sport climbs in the Upper Gorge have had foot jams~ or rand smears in corners~ and they excel in that role.  The rubber has great friction~ I’m still adapting to it~ I think it’s probably more similar to Vibram Grip than Vibram Edge (which I use more) on the softness/firmness spectrum.  At some point I’ll get some photos out on the rock but my time has been a little tight.  Anyone else try these?,Jul 2009,Feb 17 2020,2
889,Acopa Spectres,1,2, Great cross between Edge and Grip. Not quite as hard as Edge rubber with all of the grip if XS Grip. ,Mar 2019,Feb 19 2020,1
890,Acopa Spectres,1,3, Sounds about right to me Layne. I keep comparing them to my long term favorite Katana Laces~ I left the Spectres at home and used my newly resolved Katanas yesterday and I felt like they weren’t quite as good as I remembered. Maybe it’s the 2nd or 3rd resole and the liners being worn but the Spectres seemed more sensitive but also weren’t slowly slipping off of holds. ,Jul 2009,Feb 19 2020,1

896,Cassin Alpinist Tech Crampon – First Thoughts Review,1,0, I have been wandering in the mountains for several years now and I have been evolving my mountaineering skills step by step. From simple hiking to rock climbing~ alpine climbing up to demanding mix climbing techniques.See full review with many photos here:https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2020/02/17/cassin-alpinist-tech-crampon-first-thoughts-review/ While evolving and acquiring new knowledge~ it has been necessary to update my mountaineering gear too. My first pair of crampons were the Rock Empire Mackhi~ and my second pair the Grivel G12. While my general mountaineering skills got more advanced~ I felt the need to update my crampons too. The Grivel G12 are exceptional~ though I was feeling that the G12 were limiting me on the mixed climbing and Dry Tooling fields.,Oct 2017,Feb 17 2020,0
897,Review of re-sling process with Metolius~ Black Diamond~ and Mountain Tools,1,0, I recently got all my cams re-slung and wanted to write a review of the process as I had never done it before and had a lot of questions. I used three different companies to re-sling: Metolius for Metolius cams~ Black Diamond for Black Diamond cams~ and Mountain Tools for miscellaneous cams (aliens~ dmm~ omega-pacific). 1.Metolius # of Cams: 8 Length of service: few weeks Recommend? Definitely. Review: Awesome service! Also the cheapest--$3/re-sling plus they inspect and lube your cams as well!   2.Black Diamond # of Cams: 34 Length of service: 1 month Recommend? No. Review: The quality of the work was of course~ great. However~ they ran out of blue slings and chose to mail my package back (all re-slung cams + blue cams w/o slings) first~ and then they sent an email to notify me. Had they called to explain or even waited for communication via email~ I would have opted for another color sling. The color doesn’t matter—I just want operational cams especially because I had cut the slings off originally before mailing. Mailing my seven blue cams back to me with nothing done to them was a waste of time and money. Shipping is expensive. #3s are heavy. And now I can't even climb on them. They said they will be out of blue slings for another 3-4 months.  3.Mountain Tools # of Cams: 13 + 2 tricams Length of service: 1 month Recommend? Yes. Review: The quality of the work was great and Larry and Jane kept me up-to-date on the service via email. My only complaint--their online ordering system was outdated and not user-friendly.  ,May 2010,Feb 15 2020,26

902,Review of re-sling process with Metolius~ Black Diamond~ and Mountain Tools,1,5," Triggered response moved to ""pet peeves"" or ""what do you hate about older climbers"" Just said that  I  don't get what makes you all think that you need to replace good webbing with new webbing ?  If its a modification to add redundant extendability sure but you almost certainly did not wear out the existing webbing & the durability of what you replaced it with might be less that~ of the stuff you cut off for no good reason(s)",Apr 2014,Feb 16 2020,2
903,Review of re-sling process with Metolius~ Black Diamond~ and Mountain Tools,1,6, i have old slings on all my cams. i keep my gear in pretty damn good condition too. lucky for me~ when i do think a sling needs to be replaced~ i can just head out to my shop and bar tack a new one on myself. whole process takes 5 minutes~ including cutting a piece of sling and melting the ends~ and putting 5 or 6 bar tacks on it. simple to do and i still very rarely replace any. people are being conditioned to think sling replacement is neededwhen its just not. someone came up with an industry safety standard for manufacturers of climbing gear to cover their asses. on the other hand~ the manufacturers do replace slings for a paltry sum~ so if it makes you feel better and you can do without your gear for a month and dont mind paying the shipping too~ and youre anal~ then go for it.... im going to send that ryan jenks dude some 30 year old well used well taken care of slings and see what happens.,Jul 2012,Feb 16 2020,2
904,Review of re-sling process with Metolius~ Black Diamond~ and Mountain Tools,1,7," I'll add my experience.  BD contacted me before I sent in my cams about being out of blue nylon~ so I canceled my order and sent my camalots to Runout Customs.  Luke did a great job with quick turn around (10 days?).  Metolius is the way to go for their cams.    Regarding not needing to replace webbing:  You're probably right~ but I do it anyways.  The cost is relatively cheap~ and the corresponding ""cost"" of failure could be high.  I put bike helmets in the same category as nylon climbing gear.  The cost of a brain injury from a possible failure of an old helmet is not worth the $100 bucks or whatever every couple of years for a new mtb helmet.   Regarding replacing old gear with new lighter gear: I'm getting older and lighter gear keeps me in the game (or~ at least makes the game more fun).  That said~ I try to balance gear longevity/durability with weight savings.    ",Jul 2008,Feb 16 2020,2

907,Review of re-sling process with Metolius~ Black Diamond~ and Mountain Tools,1,10, I personally change the dogbone/sling on sport draws (they do see more abrasion~ generally~ at least in my experience)~ but I haven't reslung cams. As far as I have seen~ nylon doesn't degrade due to time alone in a significant way (exposure to UV or element may be different). Therefore my personal criteria is just inspection & replacement on visible wear. If the question at large does interest you~ there's a few topics on MP on that subject with links to various tests & studies on older material. It's interesting reading/viewing.,Apr 2017,Feb 16 2020,0

914,latest (2019) version of Scarpa Phantom Tech,1,0, Anyone  had a chance to try out these new  Scarpa boots? Comments?,Oct 2017,Jan 14 2020,0
915,latest (2019) version of Scarpa Phantom Tech,1,1, I can only comment on fit as I did not pull the trigger on them: I have a wide-ish forefoot~ regular heel~ and low arch.  I felt that for me~ the new phantom tech was too loose in the heel~ little too low volume in the forefoot~ and a bit less wide toebox than what you would expect from Scarpa.  I have not been able to compare with the previous PT model (trying to score a couple discounted pairs to try on as they are no longer in stores around me)~ but I can compare with the old Mont Blanc GTX (not Pro) and La Sportiva's line of ice boots.  The Mont Blanc GTX was a pretty great fit for me~ I was expecting something similar from these but was let down.  Most Scarpa rock shoes also fit me well.  Compared to the average la sportiva fit~ the new PT feels just a tad wider but fairly similar in volume and little sloppier in the heel.   From what little reviews there are online~ I saw a few agreeing sentiments on fit - but hey YMMV~ I may just have a weird or hypersentive foot.  They feel super light though~ and I was looking forward to these because of the more durable sole and normal lacing/zipper~ but I'm still on the hunt.,May 2019,Jan 14 2020,1
916,latest (2019) version of Scarpa Phantom Tech,1,2, I just got it. I was using Nepal Cubes before~ except my left heel got murdered on approaches~ despite any adjustments I made. Unfortunately~ my heel is still messed up~ so in trying on different boots~ the new phantom tech was the one in which my left heel hurt the least. Compared to a nepal cube or a Trango Ice cube~ these walk much easier and climb the same~ for me. Also~ I had to wear a 44 in Trango ice cubes~ 43 in Nepal cubes~ and settled on a 42.5 in the PT. Boot fit is highly personal...sad that there aren’t more shops that carry a wider selection than the usual basic Scarpa/Sportiva latest offerings.,Jan 2020,Feb 14 2020,0
917,latest (2019) version of Scarpa Phantom Tech,1,3, For reference~ I usually rock the scarpa Mont Blanc Pros and have had a pretty good fit with those. I ordered the newest phantom techs thinking it should fit the same but the fit changed. For me the heel is way too loose. I tried a variety of solutions but nothing worked for me. Other than that the boot is fantastic. It's warm~ it's light~ it walks incredibly well~ and for me the toe box is the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a mountaineering boot. Unfortunately for me~ I just can't get past the heel lift.,Nov 2017,Feb 14 2020,0
918,latest (2019) version of Scarpa Phantom Tech,1,4, I got to try the new MBPs and the last gen Phantom techs to update my comparison. I agree the MBP heel fit is nice; glove-like compared to some other boots. Not at all like what i remember of the new phantom techs.  The lower volume toebox was a no-go for me though.  Last gen phantom techs were a middle of the road heel-fit between the new phantom techs and the MBPs~ the toe box was adequately roomier than both. ,May 2019,Feb 14 2020,0

924,Greater Tahoe Gripworks Resole Reputation?,1,5, Hi Brendan. Not sure if you’re still considering sending your shoes in~ but please make note~ our shop is moving to a new location during the month of September so turnaround time is longer than normal. We do repair all styles of shoes and have a lot of experience with all the shoes you mentioned. Please give us a chance! Thanks - Chris,Aug 2012,Aug 18 2018,3

935,Greater Tahoe Gripworks Resole Reputation?,1,16, Greater Tahoe Gripworks is my favorite resole company. I have sent shoes to the rubber room~ a shop in the NW and GTGW. I resoled a pair of shamans and 5.10 blancos with Gripworks. The shoes are crisp and new and show no signs of defects. Send your shoes to Chris! He will return a quality product.

940,Greater Tahoe Gripworks Resole Reputation?,2,0, Sent a pair of shoes in a year or two ago. Nice resole. Took over a month. My only complaint: I had requested XS Edge. After charging my credit card~ and having my shoes for three or four weeks~ I was notified they were out of the requested XS Edge. I could either wait for the next delivery of Edge or resole with C4. Either set aside the specific rubber for my shoes when you receive them~ or~ let me know right away that you won't have the rubber I've requested. I didn't like that they had my shoes for a month before they told me.,Nov 2009,Feb 12 2020,0
941,Greater Tahoe Gripworks Resole Reputation?,2,1, I had him put no edge resolves on a couple pair of Tenaya shoes for me. Mine didn’t turn out well but my daughter loved hers.  Later I noticed he no longer will do that on non LS shoes so I guess that’s that.,Jul 2017,Feb 13 2020,1
942,PitchSix Adjustable View Belay Glasses,1,0, Just got a pair of PitchSix EyeSend Adjustable Belay Glasses.  Pretty legit~ the field of view is adjustable so you can see far more on overhanging routes.  There's a small lever which makes the frames move to ant angle you need. Normal belay glasses don't work super well for steep routes so these are great.  Especially for multi pitch.  Durable and come in a good case.   Recommended over other glasses I've used for sure,Feb 2020,Feb 12 2020,0

948,MM Harness,1,0, I hear alot of controversy about MM Harnesses. People either love them or hate them. Why do you think that is? Also what are your personal opinions on them?,Jan 2020,Feb 1 2020,0
949,MM Harness,1,1, Have you read the previous threads about these harnesses? People express whatever complaints they have in those.,Nov 2009,Feb 1 2020,2
950,MM Harness,1,2, I like them~ for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with the nature of their harnesses. They're one of the last Made in USA climbing manufacturers. They are super loyal and active in Southeastern climbing communities. They're nice guys. Oh~ and I've never had any issue or complaint about any of their harnesses or boulder pads (not a huge fan of their backpacks~ though).,Jan 2015,Feb 1 2020,0
951,MM Harness,1,3, There’s not a lot of people who genuinely hate them; rather~ there’s a lot of people who REALLY love them~ so people say they hate them to troll and/or be “edgy.”,Jul 2014,Feb 1 2020,0
952,MM Harness,1,4," My medium sized Turbo is sturdy~ comfy~ and wearing well. I have a 30"" waist and fit right in the middle of its range.  I wish it had a proper gear loop at the rear though. I think I tried to order it that way but don't remember what happened. Anyway~ a loop weighs nothing; why aren't more built that way?",Dec 2010,Feb 1 2020,0
953,MM Harness,1,5, Love. Local shop had a MM Sonic vs an identical looking Black Diamond. I hung in both from the eyebolt they'd stuffed into the roof and the difference was amazing.

955,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,1, Sterling Nano IX 9.0 is my favorite rope. Slightly lighter than the Volta and it's cheaper!,Jan 2020,Feb 11 2020,2
956,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,2, Beal Joker 9.1.  Probably the least expensive option for a skinny triple-rated rope.  A bit stiff out of the box~ but it softens up with use.,Apr 2011,Feb 11 2020,4
957,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,3, Never used the Volta~ but both the Joker and the Nano listed above are great ropes. The nano is way skinnier 'in the hand'~ but the joker is unicore. Both are solid options in my opinion~ but if price and availability are the same I'd probably choose the Joker. It's just a little more confidence inspiring due to feeling larger and being unicore.,Jan 2017,Feb 11 2020,1
958,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,4, I really like my mammut serenity and partners often comment on how nice it is.  It is an 8.6 mm triple rated rope so it is thinner.     I am looking forward to the edelrid swift protect pro 8.6 mm rope to be released later this year.  It should be much more cut resistant~ not that I have had any problems with wear or cutting with the mammut serenity.,Feb 2006,Feb 11 2020,2
959,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,5, I think you would find the Sterling Fusion Ion R 9.4 to handle about the same.  It doesn't feel like a fat rope at all~ which it isn't~ but my BD 9.4 feels like a 10.5mm,Jul 2015,Feb 11 2020,0
960,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,6, Volta Guide is a little thinner~ triple rated too~ handles the same and is UIAA dry treated. What’s not to like?,Mar 2019,Feb 11 2020,0
961,What compares to Petzl Volta 9.2? Your favorite rope?,1,7, I had one experience with the volta~ which was positive the first three or so times i climbed with it~ but the rope's sheath deteriorated very quickly. Used on maybe 15 or so routes and already ready to chop about 15 feet off of it. I won't be buying it again~ even though it does feel real nice right out of the package.,Oct 2019,Feb 11 2020,2
962,Scarpa Furia Air~ the new fiveten team XVi?,1,0, Howdy folks~ none of you seem to be talking about these svelte new shoes from scarpa. they seem to have taken a look at the five ten XVi (which is~ beyond compare~ the most comfortable aggressive shoe I've ever felt)~ and taken them to their logical conclusion. I died inside when five ten canceled the team XVi~ and that was the final straw for the company for me (not selling rubber to resolers anymore was the second last straw)~ so I am tickled pink that there is finally another shoe out there that feels more like a ballet slipper than a mountaineering boot. the durability of these shoes is questionable~ but I felt the same way about the teams and ultimately could get a solid year of gym use out of a pair before they were too far gone~ so I am mildly optimistic. I've read some bad things about the durability of other newer scarpa footwear (arpias and phantom techs come to mind)~ but hopefully they got these ones right. have any of you guys taken these shoes for a spin yet? have you discovered a similar shoe (love volume and sensitivity taken to the extreme) from a different brand that I haven't heard of? I've got a box of furia airs in the mail that I'm itching to take for a spin ,Jul 2017,Nov 3 2019,0
963,Scarpa Furia Air~ the new fiveten team XVi?,1,1, I demoed them. I was on barely overhanging pocketed limestone so not the ideal setting~ but could extrapolate how they'd perform elsewhere. I have never worn anything as sensitive. I have had several pairs of blue/black teams and tried on xvi's once or twice. Furia Air's are much better constructed so I'd guess they'll last longer than vxi's. They edge better than expected as well. They seem like a perfect shoe for roof smearing. Definitely a specialized shoe IMO,Feb 2013,Nov 3 2019,0
964,Scarpa Furia Air~ the new fiveten team XVi?,1,2, Furia air actually has a stiffening laterally under the toes that the regular furia S and drago do not. It doesn’t run back past the ball of the foot though~ so still ridiculously soft length wise.  I haven’t tried the furia air yet to give a comparison~ but I think the drago and furia s (climb the same) are a solid team replacement.,Jan 2015,Nov 6 2019,0
965,Scarpa Furia Air~ the new fiveten team XVi?,1,3, turd burglar~ Do you have had a chance to climb in the Furia Airs? Have you climbed in the gym or outside with them? What do you think about them so far?,Aug 2018,Nov 12 2019,0
966,Scarpa Furia Air~ the new fiveten team XVi?,1,4, A solid replacement if they fit your feet. Better constructed than Teams~ but do not fit my feet as well. Unparallel makes an XVI replacement called the Leopard. In reality it is closer to a Team~ but the people I know that use it really like it. Much better construction.,May 2017,Nov 14 2019,0

968,Scarpa Furia Air~ the new fiveten team XVi?,1,6, I bought a pair of the Furia Air but returned them because they don't fit my feet correct.  They basically fit the exact same as the Vapor V which for me is too narrow in the toe area and has dead space in the heel.  ,Dec 2019,Feb 11 2020,0
969,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,0, Hi~  So i have tried tenaya ra & oasi~ The most comfi shoes i have ever put on.  Could not find matsia & iati~ but i would love to hear opinions about those models~ and the differences between all of the above.  Looking for a shoe for sport routes outdoors. Thanks! ,Jan 2020,Jan 23 2020,0
970,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,1, Of the models you asked about...Have and really like the Iati. Reasonably sensitive shoe that is a bit stiffer than some of the other Tenaya models I have. Edges very well~ smears very well~ and has surprising power in the toe box. Really good all-arounder. Like other Tenaya models~ it is very comfortable. The lacing system does take some getting used to...Haven’t tried these outdoors yet ( winter)~ but the Tarifa and Mundaka models have been stellar performers outdoors. Think these will be too.,May 2013,Jan 23 2020,0
971,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,2, I have the ra and oasi (also tatanka and tarifa).  comfy for my morton's toe and excellent performance. ra's been great for edging~ oasi's been great for hard sport. a lot of tenaya shoes tend to fit a narrower foot profile~ especially the tarifa which I can't wear anymore because of how painfully narrow it is for me. many of their shoes are generally narrow if you're considering crack climbing in the future i hear the mundaka is for wide feet,Sep 2014,Jan 23 2020,0
972,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,3, I'm on my third pair of Oasi right now. For the first month I used them I actually hated them and was going to return them because they felt so strange - turns out they were my first pair of shoes that actually fit my feet properly. Basically this is the main point for me. They're also the perfect combination of response and stiffness for much of the limestone climbing I do~ so I like them for that. The downsides I've noticed are: (a) Tenaya doesn't sell them with the separate strap fasteners anymore~ which were really nice~ (b) toehook and heelhook sensitivity are a noticeable step down from my Pythons~ but that comes with the shape I guess~ (c) with age~ the blue heel tensioning band begins to rip where it meets the finger pull loops. The top of the rubber that forms the heelcup can begin to delaminate after aggressive heelhooks~ and the white leather above toe knuckles pops holes fairly quickly if you flag a lot on abrasive surfaces. Assuming they fit your feet (easy to tell~ <1/4 of a US size stretch over their lifetime)~ I'd recommend them for climbing where toe precision is the main concern. I would recommend a softer shoe for places where toe and heelhooks dominate the style. Looks like they handle three resoles pretty well in terms of function (not so much in terms of fashion~ but I don't care about that). The feel obviously changes but they've never stopped being supremely comfortable.,Aug 2014,Jan 23 2020,0
973,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,4, I have worn 4 pairs of Oasis (10m)~ one Oasi LV (9.5m)~ one pair of masai (10m).    Street size is 11-11.5m If the Oasi fits you~ then the Mastia probably won't. The Mastia has a very wide forefoot. Like insanely wide. Wearing a 9.5m Mastia I can pinch the fabric over the top of the fore foot.  If you like the Oasi and want a stiffer front end~ the masai is the way to go for skinny feet.  Unrelated: My oasi's have been through 3 resoles. The third started to let got early on all three pairs so I think 3 may be the limit on the Tenaya Oasi's,Jan 2017,Jan 23 2020,0
974,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,5, my inti's and ra's feel basically identical...which is great! i really have a hard time telling the difference...,Dec 2014,Jan 23 2020,0
975,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,6, Wow thank you so much guys~ I now am more comfortable with oasi women as my choice. Thanks! ,Jan 2020,Jan 23 2020,0
976,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,7, Maybe someone can provide some insight for my issue. I have 2 pairs of Oasis and I think they're amazing shoes. My favorite so far. I feel pretty precise in them. However~ I'm starting to realize that my feet are dumb: I have a wide forefoot and a narrow heel. To illustrate this point~ I bought some Chacos online before I realized this. My foot was almost too wide in the front for the Chacos and almost the exact length I needed~ but the heel area was wayyyyyy too big. I've noticed this in my Oasiss~ as well (plus nearly every other shoe I've owned now that I think about it). When I first tried them on~ everything felt great. After pretty extensive use~ the forefoot still feels precise and tight~ but the heel is so loose it's starting to pop on hooks. Before someone says 'downsize'~ I did when I first bought the pair and absolutely could not climb fore more than a minute because they were so tight. So~ my question is this: do any of the other Tanaya shoes have the kind of fit that I need or can anyone recommend a shoe with a similar feel but better fit for my dumb feet? Thanks,Feb 2018,Jan 23 2020,0
977,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,8, Tenaya Mastia has the wide forefoot~ but for the length I also felt the heel was pretty baggy. Have you ever tried the Acro From butora? It has a medium wide front end~ and a painfully small heel cup. Once you've broken them in the heel is still fairly snug.,Jan 2017,Jan 23 2020,0
978,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,9, The Mastia is not insanely wide. If I put it next to a Solution it is still narrower and those are not a wide shoe.,May 2017,Jan 23 2020,0

980,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,11, I've never worn a solution~ but relative to the Oasi~ Masai~ TC Pro~ Scarpa Origin~ and Muira~ the mastia is wider feeling at the size. The fabric isn't even tight across my foot.,Jan 2017,Jan 23 2020,0
981,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,12, I love my Iati's. They're comfortable right out the box~ but still feel and climb like performance shoes. My only complaint is with the closure system: there's been plenty of occasions (especially climbing outside) where the velcro strap has undone itself mid-route. Usually just a minor inconvenience~ but one worth noting none-the-less.,Jul 2015,Jan 23 2020,0

The fabric isn't even tight across my foot. They're higher volume than other Tenaya shoes~ yes~ but the actual width of the toebox is not wide at all. The extra fabric in your photo is the extra volume~ which is usually up-down room in the shoe. It is still quite narrow compared to everything else out there including the Skwama that they copied.,May 2017,Jan 24 2020,0
983,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,14, The Mastia's are huge. 1 size below my typical Tenaya size~ which is 1 size below my street shoe size~ was still at least 1 size too big. For those who want help counting~ that's at least three full sizes below my street shoe size. Three. 3.,Oct 2008,Jan 24 2020,0
984,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,15, I wear my Mastia in a 7.5 US and I’m a 10. The Tenaya guys recommended this based on my other shoe sizes. It’s .5 below what I would wear an Iati in so that’s not that downsized.  Tenayas are comfortable but I can imagine how people could wear them as big as they claim.  Of the sponsored climbers 3 sizes below street is the norm,May 2017,Jan 24 2020,0

989,Tenaya climbing shoes info,1,20," Did you find a significant difference between the Oasi lv and Oasi? I heard heal is more narrow (and supposed to fit female feet) ~ but any thing else.? New Reply to Tenaya The proportions of the shoe are almost the same probably just a few percent ""tighter"" across the whole shoe~ with the exception of less material over the top of the 'ball' of the foot. (I'd very subjectively say 7-10% tighter across the ball of the foot. And 3-5% everywhere else.)  Basically if you like the Oasi~ you will like the LV. For me the difference is basically a super thin pair of socks.  ",Jan 2017,Jan 27 2020,0

991,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,1, Damn I need to check that app. Your feet are higher volume than mine and wider. Miura laces also fit me narrow mostly because of the toebox shape. Five Ten Dragons~ the old lace up ones~ were about the best thing as you could really customize the fit on a given day. The Unparallel replacement is not quite as form fitting. Anyways~ The Mastia to me feels like a Skwama and Solution mixed~ but less bulky. Pros: -Comfort -Very precise feeling/pointed toebox -Simple strap system that easily allows tensioning one end of the shoe more than the other. -Decently sensitive. -Can edge on vert pretty well for a split midsole shoe Cons: -Heel twists on hard heel hooks even though it is very form fitting. I have only had it worse on a pair of blown out Teams -Why on earth didn't they extend the toe hook rubber up and over more? There is the space for it. -Sock liner is nice~ but I like their older liner better. Feels more substantial and tensions the top of the foot more. The white elastic doesn't do as good of a job. -Wish it had the old strap system. -Black lining material near the heel has ripped. -Tacky looking. Not that climbing shoes need to be pretty. Just no attention to detail with this shoe it seems.,May 2017,Jan 27 2020,0
992,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,2, The scan is done by standing on a pad scanner thing at a shoe store. Mine was done at a Fleet Feet. I'd be surprised if your feet are lower volume.

So my feet are probably permanently jacked up.,May 2017,Jan 27 2020,0
994,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,4, Here’s my take on the Iati. Great shoe. Comfortable out of the box. Medium stiff to soft. Oasi is softer. My son wears those.  If you are looking for a pair of shoes as comfortable as the Iati with the same foot/last shape~ but a much better heel cup and a bit stiffer more powerful toe~ the Acopa Merlin fills the bill. I own both. After a lengthy session last night in a brand new pair of Merlins that needed zero break in and we’re comfortable from the first climb~ I woke up this morning and looked at my gear in the floor and had to ask myself~ what am I going to do with these Tenayas now. I love the shoes and I’ll keep them for bouldering sessions where stiffness isn’t required but sensitivity is key. The heel cup on the Merlin is full surround with much thicker rubber than my Iatis.  For face climbs~ thin edges and such~ the Merlin will be my new go to shoe. The rubber is a touch harder than the Iati~ yet stickier.  Both great shoes. Both with a place. I do know that the Merlin is built stronger than the Iati and will likely last twice as long. Hands down my new favorite where previously the Iati held that title. ,Mar 2019,Jan 27 2020,0
995,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,5,  Where are you finding the Acopa's? Thought they were discontinued.,Jul 2015,Jan 28 2020,0
996,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,6, I’m glad you like the Acopa~ but I can’t imagine choosing a shoe for bouldering that is quite as flat and has almost zero toe hook rubber unless I also had a second pair that was the opposite (Solution/Skwama and Miura type combo),May 2017,Jan 28 2020,0
997,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,7, I have climbed almost exclusively in tenayas for the last 3-4 years. In particular I like the Oasi~ Iati~ Tarifa~ and now~ Mastia.  The Iati is stiffer than the Oasi~ but the fit is nearly identical. I prefer them for the gym and/or overhanging sport routes.  The tarifa is narrower~ stiffer~ and you can dial in the fit better with the laces - I use them exclusively for eldo~ and most vert/off vert outdoor climbing. In general~ this is my preferred outdoor climbing shoe. I just started climbing in the Mastia for the last month (note: downsize at least .5 to 1 from your size in Oasis/Iati). Wider forefoot~ better heel (for me). Have not tried them outside but loving them as my go to hard bouldering gym shoe.  My shoes are sized quite tight~ but I can still wear them a reasonable amount of time and they are more comfortable for me than equivalently sized shoes in other brands. ,Feb 2016,Jan 28 2020,0
998,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,8, I spoke with 3 Tenaya pros about their shoe choice and it was interesting: -One basically said he chooses whatever he is feeling for a route/project and it can change daily. He is not known for being super particular about shoes. -Another makes his choice entirely on the heel/toe patch. He has recently worn 2 different shoes often as he feels the Oasi heel is more sensitive/thinner~ but that he can't crank on it as hard as the Mastia. -The third wears the same shoe all the time. Wants predictability. Currently really liking the stiffness of the Mastia toe box for granite. Personally I need to give the Mastia a bit more of a chance. The Oasi is also really comfortable and heel is slightly better for me than the Iati~ but it seems they all overlap so much that going with fit makes the most sense.,May 2017,Jan 28 2020,0
999,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,9, Mastia definitely fits wider than their other shoes. I got wide feet and narrow heels. Mastia fits well. The only complain I have is whatever the upper material they used aren't comfortable at all. They feel like fish netting on my feet.,Aug 2007,Jan 28 2020,0
1000,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,10, Yup~ they should have used the older liner. While they were at it they could have easily used the old strap system and/or not used the white elastic. There is nothing to help take any extra volume out of the shoe.,May 2017,Jan 28 2020,0
1001,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,11,  Where are you finding the Acopa's? Thought they were discontinued. If you haven’t seen the recent announcements here in the forum~ Acopa is back.  https://acopaoutdoors.com/,Mar 2019,Jan 28 2020,1
1002,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,12, The original poster didn’t mention looking for bouldering shoes. And I don’t use the Merlins for bouldering. I’ve got other shoes that I could use in that role.  I own the Iati. Though it lacks a decent toe patch. Not that I do a lot of toe hooking. Also the Merlins are as downturned as the Iati/Oasi~ if not more. ,Mar 2019,Jan 28 2020,0
1003,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,13, Considering Tenaya shoes are not downturned that is not a surprise. The Oasi toe patch is already pretty bad for toe hooking and is usually the most criticized portion of the shoe. Not saying they're bad. I think I mis-read your comment as the Merlins replacing everything as your bouldering shoe where you actually said you'd keep the Tenayas for that.,May 2017,Jan 28 2020,0
1004,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,14, No I'm not much of a boulderer. I've got the drive of a 20 year old with the shoulders that reflect every one of my 50 years. That's a bad combination and a recipe for pain so I just refrain.   It's kind of a shame Tenaya doesn't make a shoe with more of a set downturn and more of a toe patch and more rubber in the heel. Of course then it would just be a Sportiva. Or~ if Sportiva could just make a shoe as comfortable as the Tenaya.   Merlin hits 3 out of the 4. Comfort~ downturn~ heel. Toes could have a bit more rubber. But at least they put the small patch where it counts unlike that little strip that Tenaya glues on. Now I'm wondering why I even like the Tenaya so much. Oh yeah. It's cause I don't climb hard enough to Really need heels and toes.,Mar 2019,Jan 28 2020,1
1005,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,15, Oof! I'm 34~ but feeling it more and more every day. Tenayas are mad comfortable. I don't really know how they do it~ but they do it well. Regarding the toe patch- a guy at my gym just bought some resole rubber and glues his own on or has a resoler do it. Most of his Mocs and shoes have enhanced patches as his gym shoes are just his old retired shoes.,May 2017,Jan 29 2020,0
1006,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,16, I just picked up my first pair of Tenaya Mundakas after trying on nearly every shoe at my local REI. I must have weird shaped feet because everything besides the Mundakas had hot spots or crossed my toes. They are extremely comfortable and the padded tongue is a nice touch. Just wish they came in colors other than bright green. I upgraded from scarpa origins so hard to compare performance but feel great on the wall.,Jun 2019,Feb 10 2020,0
1007,Tenaya climbing shoes info,2,17, Mundakas have become the favorite shoes in my quiver. Insanely comfortable. Smear and edge very well. A bit of downturn helps with power-- yet super comfortable. How the heck Tenaya did this I don't know. The rest of my quiver are on their way to becoming niche shoes only. The only drawback is the lacing system- and that is only until you figure out the subtleties-- then it is yet ANOTHER plus for these amazing shoes. Work equally well on plastic~ sandstone~ granite. Wow.,May 2013,Feb 11 2020,0

1014,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,1,1, It's nice to see an older shoe (these came out~ what~ 20+ years ago?) that can compete with the oh-so-popular-these-days TC Pro. I have to admit~ I get a chuckle watching the new generation rediscover the benefits of a firm shoe.,Jul 2009,Apr 6 2018,7

1030,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,1,17, You do realize that the primary sizing for Boreal is in Brit sizing~ which runs larger by about one number than US sizes.  Boreal is really consistent on sizes~ but I usually look at the Euro size listing to find the right size.  So~ for me a Boreal size looks like this: 6.5~ 40.0~ 7.5.

1032,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,1,19, I was able to get out this weekend to try the shoes out~ sized one down from street shoe. I found that it still ran large and I wasn’t getting the edging performance I need. I thought the rubber was a decent performer on the routes I climbed. It would probably be better with a resole~ I’m sure.  Tough luck on the sizing. It must be the shape of my foot~ or your foot~ that determines how far to size down. There is no way I can wear a size 9.5 much less a 9 (US) with a 10.5 foot. It would cripple me. The laces on 1/2 size down are spread about an inch apart already!,Jul 2015,May 8 2018,0

1034,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,2,0, Agreed~ this is more of a specialty shoe for me. I will generally just pull on either Mythos or some many-times-re-soled 5.10 Spires or Coyotes. But those shoes are not comfortable in long splitter cracks~ at least not for me.,Jul 2015,May 8 2018,0

1036,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,2,2," More to add on this shoe:  did 10 pitches yesterday on three climbs(8 am to 4 pm) and had these shoes on almost the entire time. Took a break for water and snacks & removed them.  By the end of the day my feet were pretty sore~ but not because of the shoes~ but because I neglected to cut my toenails... two of the pitches were majority crack~ with some face holds thrown in. One was a finger to hand~ which these shoes did OK on~ the finger portion was in a corner so you could just wedge your foot in the corner. When you moved to the hand crack on the face whole toe would go in.  The last pitch was about a 4""-10"" OW/squeeze in stacked basalt columns.  The Ballet Gold rocked~ I truly think it lowered the difficulty one whole grade for me. My partner was wearing Muiras~ and he was like ""Dude~ that was a rad lead"". I told him ""It was the shoes!""  Since he was on a TR~ he was able to do a lot more face climbing outside of the crack~ whereas I had to put pro in and pretty much stay in the crack. The only bummer was a section where a wide stem would have gotten me off my arms and a needed rest~ but the smearing ability of the native rubber just isn't that good.  really would be better with a re-sole with either C4 or XS Edge.

1064,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,10, I think I somewhat agree with you. I just got two pair back from the resoler~ one pair of La Sportiva Mythos and one pair of La Sportiva Synchro's. The Mythos had rubber stacked on them~ and they are unusable. The space in the toe has changed so it is like trying to put your foot into a wedge. I wore them on Saturday for 3 hours and my big toenail on my left foot is now purple with blood under it. It was very painful. They also don't fit into thinner cracks now~ cracks that they used to be perfect in they now don't quite fit. ,Jul 2015,Sep 10 2018,3
1065,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,11, Sorry to hear about your resoles~ we do guarantee our work. If anyone has any issues with their resoles~ contact us at Positive Resoles and we will do what we can to make things right. Stacked resoles are easier and quicker to do~ which is why I charge less for them. I only do a stacked resole if a customer selects it on the order form or asks for it. Stacked resoles are the least likely resole to change the fit/shape of the shoe because it is less invasive to the shoe. We reached out to Buck to clear up some confusion regarding his post. His Mythos were not stacked and received a regular resole with C4 thick 5.5mm and a new rand. His Synchros received the stacked resole. Thicker rubber can make the shoe have more tension (affecting fit) and will make the shoe thicker (from top of the toes to the bottom of the sole)~ which can be noticeable in cracks. Resoles with thick rubber will stiffen a shoe and may require some break in to soften back up.,Feb 2015,Sep 12 2018,2
1066,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,12, I in no way will blame Positive Resoles for the fit of my Mythos. They have had many multiple resoles from 3 different resolers. They just maybe are too old and worn out for another resole. The leather fit me like a second skin~ so I am a little sad to have them not fit perfectly. But I'll still do single pitch stuff with them~ and maybe they will come back. But they pinch me too much right now to take on any multipitch stuff.  ,Jul 2015,Sep 12 2018,2
1067,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,13," ""Stacking seems to me to be what a resolers does when they're too lazy to take the original rubber off."" Stacking is not the right way to go for all shoes~ nor all climbers. It is not done out of laziness~ but instead done to increase the life of shoes~ and of course to add new rubber. It also helps maintain the original shape. As far as delams go~ all shoes and rubber can and will delaminate depending on conditions. High summer heat of course being the worst. All glues used~ are heat activated. This time of year~ it's not uncommon to get some delamination. Things that can help are to avoid leaving shoes in a hot car and don't stand around in them on the hot ground. Remove between climbs when possible. Delams are an easy fix. If your shoes start to delam~ head to Home Depot or similar and get a small wire brush and a decent contact cement such as BARGE (Or equivalent). Clean and ""Rough up"" both surfaces using the wire brush. Get it to where the brushed rubber takes on a dull look. Don't touch the area! (Grease on fingers will mess it up!).Follow instructions.  Bingo! For the record~ I always climb in ""STACKED"" Boreal ACES (Or Ballet Golds) and have for many years. ""Stacking"" works well and is a plus! No if's~ and's or but's about it! But you do need to know what the advantages/disadvantages are~ and to choose accordingly. SIDE NOTE: ""I heard from a very notable climber not to stack rubbers."" I have personally ""Stacked"" countless pairs of shoes for ""Very notable climbers"" (With zero complaints). Just saying...",Oct 2002,Sep 12 2018,4
1068,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,14, It has been a year~ and I am still in love with these shoes. They got a re-sole with 5.10 C4 rubber from Positive Resoles in JTree in August  2018. They have really shined in certain areas. The Black Hills granite~ with all the crystals~ is perfect for these shoes. I used them exclusively there. I brought some softer Velcro's~ but it gets painful standing on tiny crystals with a softer shoe.  Lumpy Ridge is another place~ with all the weird flaring cracks~ the Boreal Ballet Gold outperformed my Mythos~ 5.10 Coyote and 5.10 Gambit.  I imagine they would also be excellent on JTree edging routes~ but they smear decent as well.  They have held up really well~ no major delamination's~ no blown seams~ pull tabs are intact~ they haven't stretched much but have gotten more comfortable. These are a 2-3 hour shoe for me~ not all day.  If I could only have three pair of shoes~ I would take the Boreal Ballet Gold~ 5.10 Anasazi Lace (Pink)~ and a tight slipper for the gym (Cobra/Skwama/Solution),Jul 2015,Jun 19 2019,0
1069,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,15, I think I'm on my 3rd pair of Ballets and 4th pair of Aces. My latest Ballet are the loosest yet and I can actually leave them on all day. I didn't lose much performance going a bigger size. I used to wear my Aces  2.5 sizes smaller now I get them in a UK size one full size smaller than my US size.  I think most kids today started off not weighing as much as adults so they don't understand the need for a broad lasted shoe. Or what they can do for you.  Another thing about these shoes is the heal is raised this helps you when you are edge'n it helps you reach those edges as it adds about 2 inches to your reach.  Good review Buck. I love these for granite but prefer a non-braod lasted thin slippers for volcanic rock. By the way as much as I miss my Viper's ( pre Colbra ) the Ninja is being completely revamped and they look awesome!

1071,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,17, These days I'm actually liking my ballet golds for routes here in red rock. I've even climbed some at my limit in them. They perform much better once you resole with good rubber.,Apr 2014,Sep 12 2019,1
1072,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,18, Got a pair of Ballet Golds a few weeks ago to replace my beloved but too-many-times-resoled Tradmasters. These shoes wrap my feet like a glove and are the most comfortable climbing shoes I've ever worn. The downside is how stiff they are. Don't get me wrong~ I love a good edge~ but for the first 5 or so sessions in them it felt like walking on wooden blocks - zero sensitivity in my toes~ zero ability to bend the sole. They are finally starting to break in a bit with some flex in the forefoot. And maybe I'm just getting used to the feel. They definitely were a winner outside in offwidth and for jamming cracks. Amazing lack of foot pain~ which is a serious plus. I haven't tried slab in them yet. ,Apr 2014,Oct 11 2019,2
1073,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,3,19," Laura~ if you re-sole them~ I find C4 to be the perfect ""blend"" of smeari-ness  and still able to hold an edge. I used them on Lumpy and BoCan granite~ and SD Needles crystals...equally good.",Jul 2015,Oct 13 2019,0

1075,Boreal Ballet Gold shoes,4,1, isn't that literally how these shoes are constructed? They are board lasted~ though I not sure what the board is made out of.  Yes~ I've had board lasted shoes before (Tradmasters) and very much appreciate the support they provide. Climbing domes in Tuolumne in slipper-soft Mythos was hell on earth for me because of the lack of support for multiple pitches and hanging belays with no real relief from the pressure on my bent feet.  Maybe I just don't remember the break-in period from my Tradmasters when they were new~ but the brand new Ballet Golds seemed a heck of a lot stiffer~ to the point where the sole did not flex at all even when applying my fully body weight to the toes and trying to bend my foot to raise my heel. Just noting that the break-in period is pretty prolonged for these shoes. I do like them better than any alternative I've tried. ,Apr 2014,Oct 14 2019,0

I used them on Lumpy and BoCan granite~ and SD Needles crystals...equally good. Thanks for this. I will definitely ask for C4 when I get them resoled. The nice thing about buying full priced shoes from Rock and Resole is that you get a voucher for a free half-resole. I'm still playing around with the original soles~ but for these shoes~ I may go in for that resole sooner than normal.",Apr 2014,Oct 14 2019,0

1091,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,0, Just wanted to post this quick review/observation of the dmm dragonfly cams.  Using a red here as an example but still applies to the set.  Dmm makes great stuff with attention to detail.  I've used many of their products with no issues.   My one concern~ which is major~ pertains to the spring gap located in the middle of each set of lobes.  The gap goes around the whole axle.  I've had serious issues with dirt and grit build up even after only using the cam on the first go.  This is a major flaw for these.  I've posted a pic of an x4 for comparison~ side by side with the red dragonfly.  The lobes are crammed together in the x4 at the top.  With very tight tolerances.  Thus reducing dirt and grit build up.  Just not the case for the dragonfly.  When cam'd ~ the gap is peaked at its largest opening~ making any grit insanely easy to get in even as soon as the cam is entered into rock.  Because the springs are located 'between ' lobes friction is then created between the lobes from grit.  Now the x4s still show a spring opening when cam'd~ but because each lobe has it's own spring you never get friction between lobes( meaning no issues when camming).I'd love to hear Dmm's explanation.  I mainly climb sandstone and the grit is definitely small enough to significantly effect the longevity of these.  For the money your paying~ I'd role with the x4s or tcu's before expecting these to last.  ,Jan 2020,Jan 19 2020,2

1093,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,2, It seems to me that this is not actually a problem for the whole set of Dragonflies~ but only the 3 smallest sizes. The larger ones (blue and up) have internally recessed cam springs much like the x4s~ and there are no big gaps.,Nov 2017,Jan 22 2020,0
1094,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,3, Tim~  I personally have not had the grit issue with the X4s.  The real issue is when grit gets between and/or underneath the Springs. When this happens cleanings no go.  Residual build-up on the outside sure can be blown out. But in the Springs or underneath it's a no go.  Can u take apart and reswag~ sure~ but most people won't have these tools.  I don't really see a reason to contact dmm.   This is their design to get the Lobes this small~ no changing it~ and the issue is there. Hence the reason for this review on their current design.   Danny  You are correct that this is only for the 3 smallest sizes ( Which is what most people would want to fit the nitty gritty tail end of their rack),Jan 2020,Jan 22 2020,0
1095,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,4, I’ve had a similar experience as the OP~ however they are easy to clean. My main gripe is that they buckle so easily and can’t be placed precisely because of the wobble-y-ness ,Jan 2017,Jan 22 2020,0
1096,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,5, If you’re using a cam that small~ hopefully the crack is clean and not full of grit to increase the odds they hold. ,Nov 2015,Jan 22 2020,1
1097,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,6, An anecdote. I recently purchased two of the smallest dragonfly cams. First day out I took a few decent-sized falls on the smallest piece (#1~ green). The unit held the falls~ but suffered some damage. Broken trigger wire and two smeared lobes. The action on the two 'unscathed' lobes is now limited by the tweaked head angle of the cam and what feels like grit in the springs. On one hand~ I recognize that the mechanics of any micro are delicate and that falling on them can tweak them enough to cause issues with future performance. Having said that~ I've never had issues with C3s or small aliens after falls. The inner lobes are so small and close to the stem that I can't replace the trigger wire at home. It's surprising to have a brand new piece of gear to be so easily and seriously damaged.  In the end: the gear caught the falls and broken gear is the cost of doing business~ but I don't think I'll get more dragonflies.,Jan 2011,Jan 27 2020,4
1098,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,7, I had the same issue with my X4 .1/.2 offset with the exception of the smeared lobes. But~ the softer metal on the lobes is the reason I went with dragonflies for my micros.,Aug 2018,Jan 27 2020,0
1099,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,8, The life span on tiny cams always seems short except for the c3’s. I love the blue alien but mine broke every time I fell on it. It held but always blew a trigger wire. Iv heard the same for the x4’s. I was hoping for more strength in the dragon flys...bummer Small master cams get gunked up easy too,Oct 2013,Jan 27 2020,0
1100,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,9, I think I’ve only aided off my C3 0 and 00s but I have seen a few f-ed up from actual falls. I did break a 000 on a fall with it at my feet. Held but got mangled. Took one fall on the red dragonfly and it’s fine except a few little crystal dents on the lobes. My belief is that I’d rather have the gear get mangled and hold than always look great but not actually hold a fall. You place pro for a reason ,Jan 2017,Jan 27 2020,0
1101,Dmm dragonfly review (problems/flaw),1,10, Absolutely agree. At the same time~ a unit (that retails for 80$) should be able to hold up for more than one day out/a couple of falls.  ,Jan 2011,Jan 27 2020,3
1102,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,0, I've been using various things for a personal anchor while sport climbing. But mostly just a long sling girth-hitched to my harness with a locker on the other end. I've also tried the typical chain-link style PAS things (like Metolius). And I gotta say~ I like the Petzl Connect Adjust much more.   Sure~ it's not as lightweight as a sling~ but the fact that it's instantly and infinitely adjustable in the blink of an eye makes it much more valuable to me.   Y'all can look it up~ but it's basically a short length of dynamic rope attached to a mini self-locking belay device of sorts. It locks up in the same way an ATC Guide or Petzl Reverso would lock in guide mode. And you girth-hitch it to your harness just like you would any of the other systems.   But you get to the top of your climb and simply clip this thing to the anchor or bolt and pull in the slack a bit. Done. And you can release it to lengthen your anchor or pull it to shorten. It works really smooth. And unlike the PAS type of designs~ you don't need to mess with a carabiner or unclip or open a gate to shorten or lengthen yourself.   Can't use it as an actual anchor to belay or climb on (like the Metolius PAS). But I don't know many people who actually do that anyway.   It also stows away on your harness better than a PAS. I have one end girth-hitched to my belay loop and the locker just clips to my harness wherever. And I tuck the slack under my leg loop. So when I'm climbing~ it's not dangling around. And when I want to use it~ I just grab the locker like a quick draw and pull. Easy.   This is actually a piece of gear I'm glad I bought and don't mind carrying. Nice design!,Mar 2015,Oct 31 2016,7
1103,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,1, I use a Sterling rope Purcell prusik. mediacdn.shopatron.com/medi…   great adjustability~ dynamic rope~ lightweight~ compact.     the best part~ theyre about $10 a piece~ compared to $50 for the petzl.,Nov 2012,Oct 31 2016,1
1104,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,2," Lol~    I use the Petzl Evolv Adjust for aid climbing and I cannot imagine anyone thinking for even a moment that the Petzl Connect ""stows away on your harness better than a PAS or anything else.    Considering my Evolvs use thinner rope~ I can't even imagine how bulky the extra cord must be when using the thicker rope used in the Connect.    I've used purcell prussics before and didn't stick with them because of their bulky nature and I'd happily marry the purcell if it meant I could kill the connect (and F the Evolv~ yum!)",Jan 2007,Oct 31 2016,6
1105,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,3, I don't really know how you're stowing a PAS or whatever you use~ but how I do it:   I adjust it so the rope is pulled all the way out of the locking device. Then clip the locker to my harness like a quick draw. Then I tuck the extra length of rope under my leg loop. Seems to be out of the way and isn't bulky at all.   But hey~ I'm not forcing you to like it lol. This is just my findings on it.   A PAS is way more bulky to me. The chain-link nature of it means it doesn't really coil up or anything. You have to double it up once or even twice on a carabiner to get it out of the way. And that is more bulky to me. But whatever~ do what you want man.   A simple sling with a carabiner on it is definitely less bulky than any of 'em. But a sling isn't adjustable.   I kinda do it like this. But I tuck the extra a little wider so it isn't dangling.youtube.com/watch?v=RY5PlN6…,Mar 2015,Oct 31 2016,3

1111,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,9, What~ exactly~ is the need for all this adjust-ability when cleaning sport routes?

1121,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,19, I own the dual connect adjust. Overall~ I think the slider design is the best available for a PAS. However~ there are other aspects of the design that could be significantly improved. In my opinion~ the rope diameter used (9.5mm) is overkill. I lead climb and take falls on skinner ropes... When climbing with a full trad rack~ I find the extra bulk and dangly bits annoying. ,Aug 2013,Nov 1 2016,4
1122,Petzl Connect Adjust,1,20, This past weekend my partner was using the Connect Adjust and I got interested in getting one for myself. But after taking a look at the Kong Slyde~ I went ahead an ordered one for less than $15.  I can sacrifice a few feet off of my old 9.8 rope to build the tether. I think that's the only big difference (besides price) between the Connect and Slyde~ how Petzl provides this fancy bartacked tether for girth hitching.   Anyone who uses the Slyde~ any tips~ lessons~ recommendations? Thanks!,Jun 2011,Nov 1 2016,0

1136,Petzl Connect Adjust,2,13, oh and by the way to me at least~ it doesn't really matter how you do something in climbing (as long as you are being safe) or what gear you use.  Everybody has an opinion and they are all different.  The key is the thought process behind it~ because all of the different methods of doing things have trade offs.  The key is knowing what the tradeoffs are and then making a decision based on that.  Different people will come to different decisions based on the personal preference and the style of climbing and the location.  So I will give you another chance.  What would you say the main advantage of this adjustable thing is over a clove hitch?  Why would you recommend to myself or anyone else that they go buy it?   Why do you chose it over a clove hitch?  I get that you like the adjustability~ but a clove hitch also has that~ so what else?,Dec 2006,Nov 3 2016,0
1137,Petzl Connect Adjust,2,14, main advantage over a clove is the ease of adjustability. with a clove hitch~ you have to feed slack in or out to adjust whereas this thing you can just clip and pull until it comes taut on you. On the other hand~ I don't see the need for such adjustability just for cleaning your typical sport anchor because it doesn't really take that long. I mean~ if you're taking more than a minute to clean a sport anchor~ you're doing it wrong.,May 2014,Nov 3 2016,0

1140,Petzl Connect Adjust,2,17, I could see the benefit of using the Connect at the top of a route before rapping back down. At some point you gotta go in direct so the ropes can be freed to rap with. I can think of plenty of ice routes and some rock where the adjustment could come in handy to stay comfortable. I could see using the Connect if you wanted to tether in but not extend your rappel.    I wouldn't buy one either but I also wouldn't pull the typical point and laugh at the PAS thong either.,Jul 2012,Nov 4 2016,2
1141,Petzl Connect Adjust,2,18, For some reason~ carrying an installed tether seems to be a reflexive flashpoint for some people~ who get all bent out of shape at the mere mention of the idea. No doubt some of those responses will show up here. I bought a Connect 'cause I'm a working stiff and can afford it~ I've always been interested in experimenting with and understanding new gear~ and I can probably sell it (at the fantastic Rock and Snow Consignment store) and recoup some of the cost if I end up not liking it. So far~ I have only used it for a few days of cragging at the Gunks (where an installed tether is hardly a necessity)~ and have not yet made up my mind about its ultimate utility. The weight isn't an issue. Some climbers will object to the bulk; the main source is the sewn loop that you girth-hitch to your belay loop. I typically wrap my tether around my waist and clip it back to itself; since the Connect has no loops (as a PAS does) it doesn't snag as much when unwrapping. Personally~ I find it to be a bit on the short side~ but this is true of some of the PAS's as well. Another foot or so would be nice. It does almost everything a tether does better (and more safely in view of its lower impact loading)~ but I'm speaking of multipitch trad climbing and alpine climbing here~ where there are a host of situations that are improved and/or sped up by a tether. (I wouldn't carry any kind of tether just to transfer from climbing to lowering on a single-pitch sport climb.) For leading or following improvised aid and when aiding to clean stuck gear~ the Connect is significantly better than anything else (other than an adjustable daisy~ which almost no one I know carries as a tether since those gadgets can't withstand much in the way of fall loads). It is excellent for instantaneous addition of~ say~ a horizontal or upward directional point to a belay anchor. The fact that you can shorten it while it is loaded confers advantages in some climbing and self-rescue situations. Since the Connect is made with a length of dynamic rope~ I'd consider utilizing it as one arm of a belay anchor. This could speed up certain anchoring situations~ especially those with only two anchor points~ but the relative shortness of the connect restricts this application somewhat. PAS-style tethers are a little better as rappel rigs and for the (very occasional for me) clipping of more than one anchor point. If you want to rappel extended with the Connect~ you either have to use a separate sling to extend the device or else clove-hitch a carabiner midway along the connect to hold the rap device. The clove hitch shortens the Connect~ which is already on the short side~ as I've said. Edit (September 18~ 2017):  I've had it for about half a year now.  Used it for some improvised aid in very wet conditions~ for multipitch climbs and rappels from the Gunks to the Tetons.  I'd guess I use it on about half the belay anchors I set up.  I've decided on balance that I like it a lot.  It's a game-changer for improvised aid and hanging to remove stuck gear~ and since most folks have never had an anchor they could adjust one-handed after setting it up~ they don't know what they are missing in terms of  increased comfort when the position they've committed yourself to starts to hurt a little.   I've tried someone else's Kong Slide~ (I think set up with an 8.5mm rope) and find it ok for tightening~ although the Petzl gadget is smoother~ but worse for loosening~ so the Connect wins for overall utility.,Feb 2008,Nov 4 2016,13

1160,Petzl Connect Adjust,3,17," I have the ""dual connect adjust"". After a brief testing period~ I decided to chop off the short end designed for rappel device extension.  This modification makes it essentially the same as the ""connect adjust"" I find that creating an extended rappel by clove hitching my belay device carabiner into the long strand (with slider) is more than adequate.  I felt that the additional bulk of the second short strand and the need to keep it clipped into a carabiner on my gear loop made the ""dual"" significantly worse than the connect adjust.   I would have preferred that Petzl use a smaller diameter cord for the connect adjust~ as the rope currently being used seems unneccisarily bulky.  I would be interested in using the aluminum slider on skinnier 7mm - 8mm cord.

Obligatory: yer gonna die. Explanation: I researched sewing soft goods and concluded it takes a non-trivial amount of research and testing to do it safely. Two surprising complexities I came across are 1) specialized needles are needed~ otherwise you may damage the fibers you're sewing into with the needle and 2) even if you get the sewing thread strong enough~ you have to make sure that it's compatible with the fibers you're sewing into; if you sew with i.e. kevlar into nylon~ the kevlar will abrade the nylon and tear out. Other things I wasn't able to find a clear answer on: 1) Do you need a speacialized sewing machine to not damage the material you're sewing into? 2) Does the shape (not material) of the thread matter? In the end I concluded that I don't even know enough to know what I don't know~ and what I don't know might hurt me~ so I decided not to go down this path. If I were to try to learn to sew soft goods I'd want to learn it from an expert.

1172,Petzl Connect Adjust,4,9, Thanks David~ the needle has to have a ball tip~ rounded~ to slide between fibers rather than cutting through. The Petzl Contact has dyneema tread at about 35# breaking strength~ I use 80# dyneema fishing line.  I don't think there is enough movement after being sewn for the fibers to wear on each other.  After being sewn it is like a rock~ with very little ability to even flex it.  You do need a special machine if that is the route you go~ but I am sewing mine by hand.  All the tread Ihave seen used has been braided~ not mono~ so under load they would tend to be round. I have had some tested and they all broke high enough to be considered safe for life support.  They all broke where the stitches start~ so now I doing a combination of a short bury splice and sewing combined to try to increase the break strength.

1174,Petzl Connect Adjust,4,11, I mostly aid climb and on walls I love the evolv adjusts as tethers for my alders and as anchor point~ however when I lead I keep them fully extended and use my al-free-fi (an Yates adjustable with a Fifi hook welded on to it) as a floating adjustable daisy~ adjusting the length on the adjusts is time consuming and a cluster fuck~ the free fi solves that. But for steep or traversing ground I have the option to first cintch up the adjust while I simultaneously lower my self off of the free fi.

1177,Petzl Connect Adjust,4,14, Andy Kirkpatrick has this to say about locker jam: Collar lock down is caused by the tightening of the collar while under load (perhaps tightened on an abseil when still hanging form the rope). Once unloaded the collar will jam~ and can only be unscrewed while loaded. In a self rescue situation this could prove very serious~ and otherwise it’s just annoying! ,Jul 2013,Dec 6 2017,0

The second time I was clipped direct to a bolt and had to cut my way free (sad face.)  I was lucky enough to be able to get my gear back after the fact by returning with~ you guessed it~ a wrench.  Now I know jammed lockers is a thing~ I'm just a little frustrated to have it happen twice with two different biners of the same model.  Never had this issue with any of my other lockers over the years~ and now twice in under nine months.   I use the recommended caribiners that you mentioned~ and I haven't had any problems with them.  I did have a Petzl Attache biner lock up once~ and I also had to use a multitool to unlock it.,May 2017,Apr 13 2018,0

1194,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,11, I use this with the Connect Adjust.  One-handed operation both clipping and unclipping~ can't forget to lock it~ accidental rubbing on things doesn't unlock it~ and of course it can't bind shut.,Feb 2008,Apr 13 2018,3
1195,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,12, I've not had any problems with the Petzl Spirit locker. They are really the only lockers I use now. They are small~ really light~ and plenty strong. It would be cool if they offered them with a twist lock instead of screw lock~ though.,Mar 2015,Apr 14 2018,0
1196,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,13, Does it fit through smaller chains or old hangers with a small opening? I have the model with wires for both gates and the wire is wide enough that it’s been troublesome a few times ,Jan 2015,Apr 14 2018,0
1197,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,14, I've very occasionally found some anchors it doesn't fit in---had to thread a sling for those.  Not frequent enough to be an issue in the places I've climbed.,Feb 2008,Apr 14 2018,0
1198,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,15, Yeah I have one and love it! I use the long adjustable end for anchoring and the short fixed for extended rappels. Works amazing ,Feb 2018,Apr 23 2018,0
1199,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,16, Petzl makes an adjustable bridge for arborists harnesses that uses the Adjust~ and the sewn eyes are coming loose.  The stitches should be straight up and down like the top eye in the picture.  The bottom eye is the defective one.  The stitches were so loose~ the owner was able to shift the stitches in the opposite direction~ resulting in a gap between the two sections of rope.,Jun 2016,May 25 2018,0
1200,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,17," First: Different type of rope and with less stitching. And the ""climbing"" version has additional material at the stitched ends as well. Second: If you look at the literature for the arborist and industrial versions~ they specifically state they are not intended for climbing. With the climbing versions~ you aren't putting a carabiner through the stitched eyes either... unless it's the end for extending a rappel. Most of the force is on the middle of the rope somewhere~ not the end. Except for the part that's girth hitched to your harness belay loop which again~ has a slightly different design to the one in your photo. And with the dual connect adjust~ the end that is used for extending a rappel... it's much larger and reinforced with a sheath. The adjustable bridge is a very different design than any of the climbing-specific versions~ which have longer tails on the eyelets~ with more stitching~ plus additional reinforcements.",Mar 2015,May 25 2018,0
1201,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,18, The girth hitch loop stitching is where you might have a problem.  When loaded the loop~ and eyes on the bridge~ are trying to be forced apart~ no matter how they are being used.  Not sure where you're going with the load only being in the middle of the rope~ but that loop will see the full load~ after any stretching is done.  I'm guessing they are the same rope only different colors.  The plastic covers are only to protect the stitching~ no added strength.,Jun 2016,May 25 2018,0
1202,Petzl Connect Adjust,5,19, Look at the Petzl Connect Adjust. The one used for rock climbing. The one this thread is about. There are no eyes being loaded on that product like there are on the bridge you are referencing. One end has a sewn loop used to girth hitch your harness. The other end bears no load. It's just doubled over and stitched so it doesn't pull through the device. And the end that is sewn into a loop and girth hitched is more substantive than the bridge product you're talking about—which has a smaller eye through which a carabiner is attached. When the climbing versions are girth hitched to one's belay loop—as intended—it definitely loads the stitching differently compared to someone putting a carabiner through the open loop~ which wants to pull the stitching apart. The Connect Adjust is not supposed to be used that way. ,Mar 2015,May 25 2018,0
1203,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,0,,Mar 2015,May 25 2018,1
1204,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,1, The forces on the loop or eye are the same.  Each half of the loop or the eye receives half the load.  There isn't a pulley type of action on the eye around the carabiner~ because the bend radius is too small to allow for that.   The bridge stitching might be shorter because when used as a bridge~ the eyes share the load.  The Connect lanyard loops receive the full load. All these products are made by Petzl~ have sewn circular connections~ and are loaded similarly enough that I thought I would warn others of the possibility of failure.  If the stitches start to slant~ or you can move the two parts of the loop in opposite directions at the stitches~ you might have a problem.,Jun 2016,May 25 2018,0

1207,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,4, Yeah well ... I tried the single-strand blake's hitch quite extensively as a personal safety with adjustable length a few years back~ on various hitch and rope strand diameters~ but getting the hitch and rope diameters to be remotely friendly for further adjustment after full bodyweight loading turned out to be very problematic. Double the adjustment range vs a Purcell prussik for sure~ but not very suitable for an adjustable hanging belay at all.,Jan 2015,Jun 5 2019,0

The Blake’s Hitch works best when the hitch and rope it is tied to are the same diameter.  Most other hitches are better when the hitch cord is slightly smaller than the rope.,Jun 2016,Jun 17 2019,0
1210,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,7,"  Looks like an ATC in guide mode~ just as a single tube instead of the typical dual tube device for belaying/rappelling. Climber's side of the rope pinches the ""brake"" side and auto locks just like an ATC or Reverso in guide mode.",Mar 2015,Jun 30 2019,0
1211,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,8, There is also a small v groove that the brake section gets pushed into.  It does release under load~ even full~ hanging body weight.  Unlike the Petzl Adjust~ this device can’t be clipped to the harness to use with a longer rope. ,Jun 2016,Jul 1 2019,0
1212,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,9, The Blake’s Hitch works best when the hitch and rope it is tied to are the same diameter.  Most other hitches are better when the hitch cord is slightly smaller than the rope. For my usage as a fully adjustable tether it was always tied to itself. 8.5mm dynamic locked up too tight~ might have another go with a length of 9.8mm Sterling Evolution cutoff~ more sheath~ lower stretch.,Jan 2015,Jul 8 2019,0
1213,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,10, There's not much tech on Kong's website for the Slyde. Does anyone know what range of rope diameters it is designed for?,May 2019,Jul 8 2019,0
1214,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,11," 9-10mm dynamic single ropes.  I use it with a 9.2mm moderately stiff Tendon rope.  It can be difficult at times to adjust.  Also tried the Slyde with an old Beal ""Verdon"" 9mm half-rope that isn't the slightest bit stiff.  It adjusted much more easily.  My conclusion is that the Slyde works best with non-stiff ropes.",Jul 2015,Jul 9 2019,1

1216,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,13, $5 shipped for something that costs $10 plus dude cuts his own rope?

1217,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,14, You probably will get just as close if the Gigi is attached to the harness~ instead of to the carabiner clipped to the anchor~ this is how I use my Adjust.,Jun 2016,Jul 9 2019,0
1218,Petzl Connect Adjust,6,15, Slots on the Gigi are much wider than that on the Slyde~ I wouldn't use a tether w/ Gigi as your only point of attachment edit: unless you are using a hella fat rope,Sep 2016,Jul 9 2019,1

I was using a single strand~ all the same diameter~ with a figure 8 on a bight at midway (ish) girth-hitched to the harness tie-in~ then the tail from that forming a blake's hitch back onto to the main strand. Main strand had the anchor biner on it attached via a strangle or similar suitable knot.

1223,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,0, Yeah....I know... I'm a little late in the conversation... almost exactly 3 years late... but hey....I was looking at daisy chains and other PAS systems when I stumbled upon this thing.  Have to say...it was a little  pricey in my view~ but found a flash sale and picked it up for $29.00.  After reviewing various alternatives~  this  made the most sense for me. I wanted to be able to have the ability for an extended rappel set up and a quick and easy way to connect to an anchor while possibly having to do it with one hand. Sometimes in ice climbing there may not be the option to have both hands free to clip into the anchor as one hand may be holding onto the ice tool set into the ice....this thing just might do the trick...right now...I'm  clipped into my basement ceiling~ but in a few weeks it's going outside for a test drive....yeah...I know ...blurry photo...bad lighting and an empty wine rack...and a prusik used to pull the DMM pivot to demonstrate the extended rappel while clipped into the master point...yes...not ideal~ but you get the point. ,Dec 2018,Dec 24 2019,2

1228,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,5, So that's with the single connect adjust right? Nice idea~ how are you gonna get that clove hitch in if the thing is under tension? Yes~ I only have the single... (The Price was right)....If it were under tension... I'd say it isn't going to happen.... That's why I attach a binder with a clove hitch~ then clip into the harness loop before the start of the climb... When needed~ just unclip from harness ( maybe need to dress the clove hitch a little) then clip to anchor.,Dec 2018,Dec 28 2019,0
1229,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,6, Yes~ I only have the single... (The Price was right)....If it were under tension... I'd say it isn't going to happen.... That's why I attach a binder with a clove hitch~ then clip into the harness loop before the start of the climb... When needed~ just unclip from harness ( maybe need to dress the clove hitch a little) then clip to anchor. Not a great shot... But you can see (2) DMM Rhino screw gates. The one in the middle is clove hitched before the climb... The photos makes it look like it's clove hitched to my leg loop...lol...it's not,Dec 2018,Dec 28 2019,0
1230,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,7, So that's with the single connect adjust right? Nice idea~ how are you gonna get that clove hitch in if the thing is under tension? Crank the PA up and clip into the anchor with a quickdraw.  Hanging from the draw~ loosen the PA and clove rap biner to it.  Crank the PA back up~ hang from it and and unclip the draw.  Loosen the PA to the desired comfort level.,Feb 2008,Dec 28 2019,3
1231,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,8, I usually prefer to use a separate 60cm sling (basket hitched to harness) to extend my rappel device~ when using the connect adjust as a PAS for rappelling.  I used to clove hitch my rappel device to the Connect Adjust~ but I find it often makes the PAS too short.  With the separate basket hitched sling for rappel extension~ there are no weighted knots or clove hitches to deal with~ after rappelling.P.S.  These days~ I prefer to use the 150cm Beal Dynamic Sling for a multi-pitch Rappel PAS and rappel extension over the connect adjust.  IMO~ it is easier to rack and carry and it has more uses on the way up.   ,Aug 2013,Dec 29 2019,0
1232,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,9," True that it does feel a bit short when you clove hitch a rappel device to the single connect... still gets the job done...but there are concession.  I'm curious about the double connect designed for that purpose... But then you get more bulk... Clearly every option has its ""pro's and con's""....I haven't decided if this piece of pro is more of a gimmick or more of a highly useful ease of use type of gear... Just need to get out and give it a test drive... But I do love the concept..I don't think it's a "" must have"" rather it's more of a ""nice to have""...I would not have paid $50.00 for it...I got mine for $29.00 which is probably the better price point.",Dec 2018,Dec 30 2019,0
1233,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,10, Here’s how I’ve found the connect adjust most useful. Rappels: clip into the most solid bolt. If both bolts are sketchy~ I clip a quick draw to both bolts while setting up the rap. It’s quick and redundant. I rarely extend my rappels bc most of the time I find it unnecessary. I’ve tried cloving a locker to extend the rappel~ but deemed it annoying and unnecessary. Sport climbing: instead of stick clipping through sections where I can’t do the moves~ I can usually extend my connect adjust to pull through the section. Of course this doesn’t work all the time~ but’s it’s really nice to have when the situation fits the bill.  Trad climbing: I like to French free sections with the connect adjust. It makes back cleaning painless and feels much better to hang on than a girth hitched sling. For trad anchors~ it’s really nice to clip directly into the first piece because it’s so easy to remove after building the anchor. It gives you tons of flexibility for moving around. Most of the haters rip on the connect adjust without trying it. For me~ it’s been a huge factor in making belays and rappels more comfortable. I would highly recommend it. * I also found that clipping the connect adjust between your legs and onto the back gear loop to be the easiest way to keep things out of the way. ,Mar 2017,Dec 30 2019,2
1234,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,11, I tried this on my harness  yesterday in my basement... good to know it's an option on the climb...thanks for posting ,Dec 2018,Dec 30 2019,1
1235,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,12, I really like the Connect Adjust~ like said earlier you are paying for the convince. ,Apr 2019,Jan 13 2020,2
1236,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,13, Question that I either missed~ or didn't see answered: How easy is it to lengthen the adjustable side of the Petzl Connect while under body weight load?  That Camp looked smooth~ and I'm wondering if the Petzl is similarly easy to lengthen while under load.,Oct 2019,Jan 15 2020,0
1237,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,14, The Camp device---at least the first ones to reach the stores---is signifcantly worse than the Petzl.  The slot is too tight for the cord and operation is strenuous.  Maybe I saw an early model~ but the one I saw is inferior.  I can't imagine that they won't fix this~ but for now I'd only buy one if you can go to a store and test it out.,Feb 2008,Jan 16 2020,6
1238,Petzl Connect Adjust,7,15, The camp swing is only worth getting if you're willing to cut to rope off it and replace it with a thinner cord (it comes with 9.7mm or so cord and it needs a 8.9-9.2mm cord to actually work properly) additionally if using it as an aid tether~ the rope it comes with is much too short. One other point is that the swing is def  not smooth when lengthening it under load as it doesn't have any gradual setting for how fast it lets rope through the device and will go from locked to wide open with no space inbetween the two.,Jan 2007,Jan 16 2020,4

1240,Acopa Merlin Review,1,0, I wrote up my initial impressions on the gear discussion page. Today I put the Merlins through the paces tonight at the gym. For reference~ I've climbed for 30 years. Never harder than mid 12s. I've used a lot of shoes and watched the evolution of shoes over that time. I still have a pair of Sportiva Megas in the closet. So I'm not new to evaluating a shoe within the grades that I climb.       For sizing I went with my shoe street shoe size of 11.5. I wear medium thin running socks and the fit was glove tight. Zero break in for my flat wide feet. Comfortable from the get go. If I wanted a bit more performance is have sized down 1/2. I only climb to 11d so I don't see any need for stupid tight shoes. Just not necessary at that grade.    The Good:Tonight I tried to use every variety of foot holds I could find and some heel hooking as well. The first thing I confirmed were my initial thoughts on the rubber. It's fantastic stuff. Not quite as hard as XS Edge~ not as soft as XS Grip. Those are the two I'm currently climbing with on my Tenaya Iatis~ Scarpa Helix~ Miura lace and Mythos. But by far it feels grippier than the XS Grip rubber. Likely grippier than the XS Grip. . I picked some greasy slick holds that I know Edge rubber would have greased off on. This stuff stuck like a mouse on a glue trap. Once locked on I could push off with confidence. No rolling on tiny edges. It's a middle ground as far as hardness with all the grip of a softer rubber. I have never used Stealth rubber so I can't compare it to that. Comfort.  I would normally break a shoe in over a week or so before I'm comfortable with it. These were comfortable on the first climb I did. The Tenaya was my other gold standard for out of the box comfort. These rival the Tenaya.  Sensitivity. I can't really speak to super sensitive shoes as I've never worn them. The Mythos and Tenaya Iati are the most sensitive shoe I've worn so far. I've never liked super thin shoes. The Merlin is not a super sensitive shoe. The rubber appears to be around 5mm on the forefoot. The rand is also thicker than other shoes I've used. Suffice to say these are built strong and you won't be blowing out toes or rands anytime soon. I'm guessing these will likely go double the lifespan of my Tenayas. At the loss of some sensitivity. I never felt like I couldn't pinpoint toe placement on tiny chips. I was always aware of where my toe was. But the rubber is thick. For me that's a bonus. I'm not bouldering. I climb sandstone face climbs~ overhung blocky sandstone~ and crystally granite. I think these will excel in that arena. They are edging machines. As for smearing~ they'll do the job but we all~ know there are better shoes for the job than a downturned shoe like this. For heel hooking they are fantastic. Far better than my Tenayas. The rand rubber in the heel is thick and fully surrounds the heel. The toe is small enough to fit in pockets. Not the smallest/pointiest~ but then again this shoe is built on a slightly wider last than the Spectre.If you like the Miura~ but want less pain because you have a wider foot~ and want more downturn and stickier rubber~ this shoe fits well in that place. The Bad: Cost. The shoe is priced up there with higher end Sportivas. Is that necessarily a bad thing? No. Given how well these shoes are constructed~ you'll likely get twice the lifespan than other similar shoes before needing a resole and the rand is going to last a long time. So yes you'll pay more initially but you'll get excellent value for your money. Should Acopa offer a more value priced shoe to go along with these? Yes. Hopefully that will come. Rubber thickness. Again~ this isn't necessarily a bad thing. But in a market full of 3mm rubber~ the sole thickness may come as a surprised to some. I really can't say much more about these. I feel I can be honest about them because I paid for them. They were not given to me to do this review although I did receive a small discount for getting in the game very early.Just as with Jon and his review on the Spectres~ I can offer a discount code for 15% off your first order. LZ16REF. No I don't make a percentage on shoes sold under that code. I'm simply stoked to see a climber owned company putting out a nice product and happy to help get the word out. These shoes are not for everyone. But if the shoe fits as they say~ they are a helluva climbing machine. I'll do another review after I get some time in and make a trip up to Chattanooga on some sandstone and Enchanted Rock for some granite crystal pulling.  ,Mar 2019,Jan 26 2020,4
1241,Arcteryx Acrux AR boots - The least durable boots I've ever used,1,0, My first pair of Acrux ARs were purchased last November and by the end of ice season (March with about 40 to 50 days on ice)~ they looked like this. ,Dec 2018,Jan 6 2020,3

1250,Passing on Dragonflies...mistake?,1,7, I picked up the tiniest one (green) to supplement the smallest end of my rack. It feels a bit like a well made alien and a bit noodly~ sorta like the old tiny WC microcams although a bit less flimsy (first time I saw the smallest of those I honestly thought it was keychain toy - didn't help that it was adjacent to some tiny tricams that had been made into keychains).  Anyway I've placed it in a couple of spots where it tamed some previously spicy sections although honestly it's so small it's hard to feel like it's going to stop more than a foot slip. I kind of prefer it to the smallest C3s because of its floppyness being more forgiving on rope movement maybe tending to walk it but I think the C3s might feel a tad stronger - a purely subjective feeling not based on the strength ratings. Haven't fallen on it yet (and hope not to). As I wear out my old aliens (picked up some old unused ones on ebay over the past 5-10yrs) I'll probably go with dragonflies. I typically rack mastercams~ regular totems~ and supplement with CCH aliens and/or C4s. The MCs are kinda burly and maybe will stand up better to abuse but I don't think they stick as well in finicky placements or  have as much bite - pretty much how I feel about their relationship with the aliens. ,Jul 2009,Sep 17 2019,3

1259,Passing on Dragonflies...mistake?,1,16, Bought a set and only kept the biggest one(purple similar to an orange metolius) and the two smallest ones(red and green) sold the other sizes after some sessions in eldo and some granite crags.  Pros and cons in my opinion Pros: flexible~dmm built~ extendable slings are nice (especially in eldo) fairly light~ metal bites real well. Cons: the action gets a bit gritty fairly quick~ keep em clean and this isn't a problem. Durability~ I get it they're a softer metal which helps em bite~ BUT I took a couple falls on the purple one and gouged a decent chunk out of it and the thumb loop plastic cracked/cut and the sling abrasied noticeably. Said falls were at practice rock (bocan) on the 11b splitter (fairly rounded edges from what I recall) anywho I've whipped my brains out on totems and totem basics and they're still holding up way better. That being said I'd still recommend the two smallest ones. Hard to beat 6kn from a cam in those sizes. I can upload a pic of the cam if you're interested in seeing it.,Jan 2018,Jan 13 2020,2

1264,Passing on Dragonflies...mistake?,2,0, Sling and loop damage after two falls~ again I still think the cam is safe for further use. Just not as durable as a similar sized totem or master cam. Hard to display in the photo but the crack went through the plastic to the metal wire. The sling abrasion is minimal but again~ after two small falls.,Jan 2018,Jan 14 2020,0
1265,Passing on Dragonflies...mistake?,2,1, WC Friends with extendable slings are reputed to have the same issue and to suffer kinking in the cable after falls.   The extendable sling on a thumb loop is a questionable feature.  The fact that the loop tightens on the loop when pulled must diminish the anti-walk property of the extended sling on the cam.  And the damage to the thumb loop and sling caused by your fall~ make me wonder by how much the safe fall force has been reduced.  Still it looks like you took a good whip and the cam did it’s job.  Thank you. ,Sep 2016,Jan 14 2020,0
1266,Passing on Dragonflies...mistake?,2,2, I cut the extendo slings off all my cams that came that way I then get the reslung camalot style. Keeps kinking to a minimum.,Dec 2011,Jan 14 2020,0

1270,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,1," Looks like the midweight parka to buy to me. Doubt the Grade VII will do anything that much better other than save a couple of ounces and give the Backpacking Light reviewer a hard-on.  Glad the weight was on point~ unlike that other website suggested. Trivial~ but still annoying when manufacturers can't give correct specs.  Tell me about the pockets. I'm as particular about hand warmer pockets as you are about hoods :-) The only thing I don't like about the Grade VII is there's relatively little insulation in front of the pockets (plenty behind~ I would prefer the same on either side or even the opposite with more insulation in front like most jackets). There's no fleece lining (just shell material) and it's easy to get what little down is there wet. It's sewn through construction in front of the pockets as well (or ""welded through~"" whatever).  How is the butt coverage? Insulation behind the zipper? ",Sep 2013,Nov 16 2019,0
1271,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,2, I ordered the same jacket for the same reasons and it's nice to see an actual review on it finally. Mine should be here in a few days.

1273,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,4," 1. The hand pockets are plenty deep~ as to be expected.  The outboard portion of the pockets have a fleece liner and the inboard portion is the same material used on the inner portion of the parka. If you stuck wet gloves in the hand pockets~ I'd say chances are very high they'd soak through and saturate the outboard down baffles.  You're absolutely right~ I have an odd irritability when manufacturers don't dial in a hood.  I honestly feel Montane could have done a way better job with the Alpine 850's hood~ along with the Deep Heat's hood.  When they list it as ""helmet compatible~"" I feel like they're stretching it to the limits there.  The Alpine 850's hood is probably slightly more shallow that the Deep Heat's hood~ which as previously mentioned~ I had a problem with last year.  If I could change anything about either~ it's be the depth of the hood to better accommodate a climbing helmet and reasonable layering systems.",Mar 2011,Nov 17 2019,0
1274,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,5," You're welcome~ I enjoyed typing it up.  I ordered a men's large and glad I didn't go any bigger.  It fits bigger on the ""large"" spectrum for me~ but layers nicely.",Mar 2011,Nov 17 2019,0

If you stuck wet gloves in the hand pockets~ I'd say chances are very high they'd soak through and saturate the outboard down baffles.  On that note~ Montane needs to study almost every single Arc'teryx hood and attempt to replicate.  I've yet to meet an Arc hood I didn't love. I liked my Montane hood better :-) I think we just have different head shapes~ helmets and preferences. Arc hoods don't have enough face coverage IMO.

1277,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,8, I think all these sub-2lb parkas are relatively fragile and it's splitting hairs going from one to the other. Only so much you can do with ~20d nylon.

1281,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,12," Hi AlpineIce~ Thanks for your detailed write up.  I'm currently going through a cold snap (-40C / -40F with wind chill and temps arounds -30C) and re-evaluating my ""of eff"" puffy.  Aka my girlfriend has usurped by OG Nilas (when it still used 850 down).  The Montane Alpine 850 looks like a great jacket for an emergency layer.  My main uses are ski touring and on temps below -15C I'd like to carry something like the Alpine 850.  I'm a medium (6'1"" 180lbs) build and was wondering about sizing - you went up to Large?   I was wondering if Medium would work if it's cut like a parka to get over my Atom LT and Goretex shell which are Mediums.  Can you help out on sizing?  As a Canadian I'd have to order online and pay duties so hoping to get some insight.  Thank you! -rad",Jan 2020,Jan 14 2020,0
1282,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,13," I recently ordered a medium. I'm 5'10"" 165 pounds and generally wear medium. It fits over a medium Patagonia nano air and goretex shell (both medium~ though the shell is cut fairly loose)~ but its a bit snug to the point that the down is getting a little compressed~ particularly under the arms. still totally fine~ but not ideal. for my use I'd rather that than have the bagginess of a large if I'm wearing less underneath~ but you're a bit bigger than me~ so large may be the way to go.",Jun 2016,Jan 14 2020,0
1283,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,14, Considering your height & weight~ I'd go with at least a large~ maybe consider an XL~ too. It's tough to recommend a size w/o knowing you.  It's a big coat to haul around for ski touring.  Even though it's only 725 grams (for the amount of warmth is provides) it'll take up a lot of room in your ski pack~ unfortunately.,Mar 2011,Jan 14 2020,0
1284,Montane Alpine 850 Down Jacket,1,15," For those asking about the jacket~ I'm 5'9"" and 150lbs~ and I probably would not go any smaller than the medium for myself. A bit long in the arms but otherwise fits well. Unfortunately as Alpineice has pointed out~ the hood is a bit snug with a helmet on. Depending on how much movement you need with the jacket on~ it could be a little restricting if you opted for a smaller jacket. I'm hoping they come out with a new jacket next year with a slightly larger hood so that I can actually turn my head comfortably. Otherwise the jacket is awesome.",Feb 2019,Jan 21 2020,0

Any experience with either? other recommendations also welcome.,Oct 2014,Feb 16 2017,0

1288,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,2, My rab trousers fell apart after two days due to a horrendous design flaw~ I bought arcteryx instead and they are nicer in every way. Basically~ get arcteryx~ it's completely worth it. The Psphison Ar is what I got as a work for just about everything pair while being more durable than my gamma rock panta~ if you only want them for winter get the sv variant.,Oct 2015,Feb 17 2017,0
1289,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,3, I looked at hard shell~ but for ice they didn't seem to give the flexibility or hold up to sharp edges/crampons that I was looking for. But I didn't have a pair to actually try out. I have the opposite problem - I don't generate the heat to dump... :( I wore 3 layers of underarmor/base layers under the soft shells I was using. Was zero out in NH last weekend...I have also looked at the OR cirque~ Mammut Eismeer and Marmot Tour. But maybe  a hardshell would be better? Too many choices! :),Oct 2014,Feb 17 2017,0
1290,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,4, I've got the OR cirques and really like them a lot.  With a pair of thin merino baselayer pants I'm absolutely fine ice climbing in the low 20's.  I managed to punch a crampon point into the upper thigh when my belayer let me over a ledge too quickly and the tear did not run at all.  Just a little hole.  They also appear from my experience climbing in really wet conditions to be reasonably water resistant and they dry extremely quickly even just standing around in the cold.  What I like best is the fit which is amazing with it's integrated velcro straps on the waist.  I can't say enough good things about them~ especially considering you can get them on sale for just over 100 big ones.  And OR's return policy is great too.,Mar 2013,Feb 17 2017,0

1292,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,6, I too jumped on the bandwagon~ purchased and wore hardshell bibs this year.  For just ice cragging~ I wear my Black Diamond Dawn Patrol Schoeller softshell pants~ but for anything multi-pitch~ I've been wearing the   Jottnar Vanir Bibs made out of NeoShell.  NeoShell really is super breathable~ waterproof and comfortable.  Jottnar makes a women's version~ the  Vanir LT.  They're just pants~ no bib.  Very highly recommended.     Jottnar is a British company solely-focused on alpine climbing.  They have no hiking or ski line~ just climbing~ so they're entire product line is engineered~ built and designed to work with a harness~ mountaineering boots~ helmets~ etc.    I never really paid any attention to Jottnar until I decided on a hardshell bib setup and knew I wanted NeoShell.  There isn't many companies using NeoShell at this point~ and Jottnar was the only one I could find that made both pants and bibs in NeoShell specifically for alpine climbing.   In regards to keeping warm~ have you tried a different baselayer setup? The reason I ask - There's nothing wrong with Under Armor~ but maybe there's a better solution out there for you?  On cold days~ I wear the  Rab Nucleus Pants under either my hardshell or softshell. They are a waffle-grid fleece pant very similar to Patagonia's R1 line.  Very warm and surprisingly very breathable.  If that still isn't warm enough~ I'd recommend the women's Rab Power Stretch Pro Pants or the women's  Patagonia Nano-Air Light Pants.  All three are made to be worn next-to-skin and under a hard or softshell pant.    I'm another big fan of Arc'teryx and you generally can't go wrong with any of their products.,Mar 2011,Feb 18 2017,0

1295,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,9, I second the OR Cirques for several reasons. First of all~ OR's warranty is insanely bomber. Second~ they're super comfortable and made with schoeller. Third~ I've owned a pair for 8 years and they're still going strong. Fourth~ I burnt a hole in a pair and OR replaced them. Fifth~ they're compatible with suspenders~ if that's your thing. Sixth~ throw on a base layer and you're golden. Seventh~ they're a small company that's run out of the US and is employed by real athletes and cool ass people who stand behind their work. Arcteryx sucks. The only thing they do right is GoreTex shells and articulated fits. Everything else is garbage and marketing with the exception of a few select pieces. I've owned arcteryx. They overcharge~ their t-shirts are designed specifically to make sure your nipples are highly visible~ and their warranty is a load of bullshit compared to OR and Pata. Buy OR. Also~ the pata Kniferidge pants are pretty fking sweet~ but I think windstopper / neoshell gets way too moist at the level you're looking to do business.,Feb 2017,Mar 24 2017,2
1296,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,10," Obviously~ fit is key in addition to functionality. As a woman who runs cold~ I usually go with a medium or heavy wt pair of long undies~ plus a pair of fairly thick softshell pants or gtx shell~ if it's sloppy out.  What separates my system from others is I've managed to find zip thru crotch versions of everything from the md wt base layer (an old version of OR's Wild Rose line) hvy wt base layer (Arcteryx)~ Isis lt wt softshell pants~ heavier softshell pants from an old Marmot ""climber suit"" (I separated the top from the bottom~ so I could wear the pants alone)~ to a pair of Patagonia stretch gtx pant. It is SO nice not to have to drop trou while wearing a harness~ I often brag to my climbing buddies when I go to pee.

Honestly it seems like an engineered weakness as there are so many ways to eliminate this failure mode.,Oct 2015,May 7 2019,0
1301,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,15, The Rab Kinetic Alpine pants are great so far... waterproof~ stretchy~ comfortable.  They are marketed as a stretchy hard shell. The jury is still out on durability.  I plan to save them for mostly snow/ice climbs to keep the abrasion down.

1302,softshell pants - arcteryx vs rab vs norrona,1,16, I have used the norrona falkitend flex 1 pants as a softshell for ice climbing. They have held up well for about 4 years. I am probably due for a replacement as they are not even a little water resistant at this point and I have put a few careless crampons into the fabric. they WERE very water resistant for about the first 3 years of use. They are my go-to winter everything except skiing pants and get a lot of use. As an added bonus~ they hold up very well to the ice screws dangling off my harness-no snags at all in that area. I highly recommend them-I will be buying a replacement pair~ unfortunately not in my signature orange color as they no longer make that color. I also had OR Cirques. Personally~ really disliked the fit and didn't wear them much. They are more high wasted than the norronas. They are a little thicker fabric and I know a ton of people absolutely love them.,Jul 2017,May 8 2019,1

1304,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,0," So I am interested in getting the new Sportiva g2SM's but was wondering if anyone has had any firsthand use/ reviews. I am torn between getting the Baruntse or the G2's. My toes do get cold and this year I have been trying the vapor barrier system to try and keep them warmer (unfortunately it hasn't been a very cold winter thus far). Obviously the baruntse is the warmer option but its also like 5LBS per boot in a size 48!! and that adds up significantly if Im logging higher mileage. The sportive review claims the G2 is very warm... warmer than spantek but~ has anyone put this to test? They seem so light that I wonder how much insulation they could actually have. Here are my activities and location. More mountaineering style climbing and trekking with light ice climbing. so Im def not doing WI6-7 and sitting at a belay for hours. Maybe doing some WI2 WI3 climbing. Most of my hiking and climbing is in the Whites in NH or up in Maine. Obviously the weather on washingon can be all over the place. Id love to et into more serious mountaineering with a possible trip to the Cascades this summer. I love the ease of use of the Boa closure system (its what I have on my snowboard boots)but just am worried about the actual warmth of the boots. thanks for your input cheers •****UPDATE***** So this may be helpful for you cold toed big footed lads like myself. I was finally able to get out in my new G2SM's this past weekend. Climbed Mt Willard on ""Left hand Monkey Wrench"" and then up ""The Cleft"" (WI2-3)with a bit of hiking and traversing mixed in between pitches and the walk off. Temp was about -5 deg F at the start of the day and warming up to a balmy 20-25deg. I wore 1 pair of thick smartwool socks and Petzl Vasek crampons. Out for about 7.5 hrs Boots fit great with 1 thick smartwool sock (too much room with just a thin pair). toes did begin to get a little cold while I was standing at first belay in the shade in cold temps but not really bad. The rest of the day my toes were totally fine- warm on the hike out. My crampons fit great on there (with the long bar cuz I have size 49 boots) The only complaint that I have and~ I believe someone else noted the same problem in an earlier post~ is this. I found that during the hiking portion of the day the boa coil for the forefoot part of the boot seemed to dig into the joint where my foot meets my leg. It wasn't necessarily painful but more irritating. Ill have to play around a little more with the tension on the lower coil and maybe its just a matter of keeping it loose to hike and then tight to climb. Seems like something that could be alleviated if they distributed the tension from the coil a little more. My boa coil snowboard boots don't have this problem but they only have 1 coil that covers the whole boot. Other than that everything felt great and Im looking forward to getting lots more use through the season and giving another update later. These boots are so light weight it really just felt like hiking in some nice winter boots. Thanks for everyones feedback and input. Ill keep you posted. Enjoy the winter. Climb On *****update 4/4/17****** Ive been climbing in these boots all season~ mostly multipitch ice and mountaineering (WI2-3) stuff but some harder single pitch climbs on toprope (WI4 ish) and I am still in love with these boots. Comfy to hike all day in with the lower BOA loose~ great performance on ice with the BOA's cinched up. My toes havnt been cold at all all season and after climbing shoestring gully (6 pitches and about a 1500 foot approach climb) with a friend this past weekend who wore Baruntses I am happy to have the G2's. He complained about how uncomfortable they were to hike in long durations.  So far durability has been great. they get on and off very easily and Im not left messing with laces loosening up or anything. Hope this helps anyone out there looking. ",Aug 2015,Jan 28 2016,1

1310,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,6, I've checked out the G2.   It's worth the money IF you need that much boot. The fact that LaSportiva used the Boa lace system should tell you the fit is amazing with none of problems the early Boa laces had. I thought the best part of the boot was the fact you can loosen and tighten the boot easily during a long route.     Haven't worn them outside so can't say how warm. The G2 is light,Jul 2012,Jan 29 2016,1
1311,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,7, I stand corrected.,Jan 2012,Jan 29 2016,1
1312,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,8," Yea My main concern is the warmth because my toes have a tendency to get pretty cold but if I don't have to lug around 10 LBS of boot that would be fantastic. I'm 6'6"" 215LS so that's enough to lug around as is especially with my pack full of gear and I do love the idea of the Boa ties and not having to lace up and re-tie with cold fingers. The G2 is pretty expensive. Damn these hobbies. Photography and climbing are not a poor mans games I guess.    Thanks for everyone's input.    Still hoping to hear from someone that has actually worn G2's in the cold.",Aug 2015,Jan 29 2016,0

1314,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,10, For what it's worth summer climbin in the cascades doesn't need more than Nepals. In fact anything more than Nepals and you'll be kicking yourself...with sweaty feet. So I wouldn't take cascade summer climbing into consideration when looking at G2s,Sep 2015,Jan 29 2016,2
1315,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,11,,Jan 2015,Jan 29 2016,2
1316,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,12, True. Nepals are even overkill for most cascade climbing. I mostly use my trango s evo. I wouldn't want to do something like Liberty Ridge in anything less than Nepals. But I do have cold feet. Did rainier a few times last year in my trangos and couldn't feel my toes for 3 months afterwards.,Sep 2015,Jan 29 2016,2
1317,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,13, OGE in Vermont has them in stock as well.    The G2 in a lot of ways is a lighter version of the Spantik from what I can tell. Holding them in person the difference in weight between the two is pretty impressive for sure. The advantage of the G2 is indeed on longer trips where the weight savings means less fatigue and the removable inner boot means no cold feet in the morning.    I think for type of climbing you like to do they will be plenty warm. Other things to consider: warmer socks that fit well is a huge help~ and the red hot superfeet insoles help with heat loss through the bottom of the boot when standing around on cold ground. Always remember keeping your core warm keeps the extremities warm as well.,May 2014,Jan 29 2016,0
1318,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,14, Got the G2s they are pretty perfect~ seem to run 1/2 larger i think though so dont add a size like some of the general boot fit principles on the Sportiva site states~ and there isnt a removable footbed/sock liner~ but there is a fixed foamy thingy in the bed so if you wear an insert it will have to stack it on top of the fixed liner.,Mar 2015,Jan 29 2016,0
1319,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,15, I climbed in the second gen Baturas (42) for years. My toes would also get cold (and bashed recently). I tried the G2SMs on at Bengate. I have a narrow~ low volume foot and I felt like my foot was swimming in the G2SMs. I actually thought the Scarpa 6000s fit me better. I ended up going with the Batura 2.0s (42.5) for the fit and so far they feel warmer than the older Baturas. I also think a 6000m boot is probably more than I need. Good luck.,Nov 2006,Feb 1 2016,0
1320,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,16, Thanks for the info everyone.    Chris I have been to IME a bunch of times but since im a size 48 -49 its hard to find them in stock anywhere. I called the other day and they had just gotten a shipment of G2 but weren't sure of all sizes yet. May run there this weekend.    Thatcher~ I wanted to get nepals but when I tried on 48 Nepal cubs they were too small and they don't go any bigger than 48. Bummer.    Ill see if they are in this weekend and then hopefully try them on. I guess Id rather have warmer feet than colder cuz I can always do the plastic bag barrier if needed for sweat.    Cheers everyone and happy climbing    (wishing there was more snow and ice in NH right now ):,Aug 2015,Feb 2 2016,1
1321,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,17, I think La Sportiva makes the Nepal Extreme for the euro market and it comes in bigger sizes than 48~ maybe 49 and 50? Just another option to keep in mind.,Aug 2011,Feb 16 2016,0
1322,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,18, so another question for all you who own the G2SM   how do you feel they run for sizing? a little big~ a little small~ or true to size? if im gonna have to special order a pair I want to make sure they fit so I don't have to send them back for another size.    Brandonian says they run a half size large but the guys at IME in Conway said they run a half size small... Sooo what do you think   THanks everyone,Aug 2015,Feb 24 2016,0
1323,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,19, I've been climbing in NH in Baruntses this year and they are warm enough to for any day in the Whites. Many days I wish for a less warm boot. They should get you just about anywhere you want to go and are much cheaper than the G2 and climb perfectly fine.,Apr 2010,Feb 24 2016,2
1324,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,1,20, Drew~    I'd say the G2SM run 1/2 size too big.    I have three other la sportiva boots that fit perfectly~ ordered the G2SM in the same size and I have a lot of extra room at my toes.,Jul 2013,Feb 25 2016,0
1325,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,0, I've found the sizing to be pretty spot on maybe a little roomy over my other sportiva boots in the same size. i def would not size down. even though they are super light its still a big boot and imho they climb well but like a big boot climbs.  overall pretty comfy and the lacing system is awesome.  Total lockdown of the heel unlike the batura.  def overkill for me unless the temps are well below zero.,Feb 2015,Mar 4 2016,0
1326,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,1, Update.   I received my G2SM in the mail yesterday. Size 49. tried them on this morning and like a weirdo wore them to the gym to get on stairmill and treadmill with them and test them out (didn't want to mess them up outside so I can still return them in case they don't fit great).    I wore the same sock setup I would normally wear in the mountains. Thin sock liner~ plastic bag for vapor barrier~ medium thick smartwool sock over the bag.    Observations so far:   fit is pretty good. Seems pretty spot on for sizing. a 48 would def be too small for me (I normally wear size 14/15 hikers and running shoes). Heel has a tiny bit of movement and my toes are def at the max length. Not jammed up against the front of the boot but not a ton of extra room.   on the stairmill I didn't really notice much heel slip unless I really leaned forward and flexed onto my toes (similar to steep hiking with crampons) I also tried standing on a little tiny ledge putting as much pressure on the smallest amount of toe as possible to see how my heels felt in there. the boots did great. again a little bit of heel movement but maybe some inserts will relieve that.    on the treadmill I put it to an incline of 15 and 1.5mph while walking backwards to try and simulate hiking downhill. I did not notice any significant discomfort from my toes jamming into the front of the boot.   normal walking around and on treadmill these boots feel great. super light~ not too clunky (for a big mountain boot with stiff soles).    I did notice a little bit of a pressure point on my right foot at the joint where my foot and shin come together when stepping high on the stairmill. Possibly from the boa coil. Ill have to play around a little with the inner boot and everything to make sure I keep the tension distributed evenly all around.    Played with both boa coils to see how it feels with tighter~ looser tension on either coil. Very nice to be able to fine tune a bit without having to tie/ untie so much.   That being said... I def do worry about the what if factor when it comes to boa coil. I have had boa system on all of my snowboarding boots. My last pair of snowboarding boots have lasted me about 5 years and still no failure but the wire on my snowboard boots is def a bit thicker than the wire for G2's and if my board boots fail I can go to the lodge and get drunk~ if my mountain boots fail it could def suck (but I can still get drunk). Im sure they took all the care needed to get strong durable materials (for $800+ list price they damn well better have!!)   And my other concern is just that pressure point on my foot joint I noticed. Only noticed it on my right foot so Maybe I just didn't have something lined up correctly or needed to play a bit.    Otherwise I think these boots are gonna be awesome. Im bummed that the New England winter has sucked this year and its going to be like 70 degrees out this weekend so I doubt Ill get a chance to test these puppies in the cold till next winter. Ill try and get up and do some technical climbing with them in the next week or 2 and then I can add more info on how they feel with crampons and such.    Thanks for everyones help in the process. I hope my review here is helpful for people.,Aug 2015,Mar 9 2016,0

1330,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,5," well I was doing vapor barrier for 2 reasons   1. My feet sweat like crazy and soak my boots and socks which leads to...   2. my boots and socks get soaked so they get cold.   I am hoping that these boots will be warm enough that I don't need to worry about it. but my feet sweat like crazy no matter what boots/ shoes/ sandals I wear.   if its not freezing out I wouldn't worry so much but if its a below freezing day I prefer to make sure my insulation socks are dry.   Im 6'6"" and in very good shape cardio wise but I think that the fact that my blood has to circulate so far to get to the extremities means my fingers and toes get cold quick. Ive had mild frostbite on both my big toes before and it left them numb for about 6 months. now they get cold quicker than they used to.    I wear smartwool either medium or heavy cushion.   Happy to take suggestions on socks or anything people like. All about trying something new.    thanks",Aug 2015,Mar 14 2016,0

1333,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,8, could also try a neoprene sock~ does the same thing as the vapor barrier but is a little more comfortable,Feb 2015,Mar 14 2016,0
1334,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,9," Hi...   I use the following boots and normally wear a 10.5 us mens  New Balance 105 EE in most of their running shoes.   Batura 2.0 43.5   Trango Cube GTX 44.0   Trango TRK TTX 44.0   Ultra Raptor 44.0    I got the G2SM in a 44.5~ but I put a Superfoot Merino Grey footbed in them.  I have used them so far in only -10 weather.  I don't get cold feet easy and on a long 3 hour approach~ a 4 hour ice climb and 2 hour descent my very thin liner sock was damp and my medium weight Lorpen midweight wook sock was dampish.     If you were on a multi-day it would be best to dry out the inner boot at night if possible~ make sure you have on fresh new dry sock the next date and alternate again if possible.   Without the Superfoot insole a 44 would have been ok for size.  I feel they are warmer than the other La Sportiva doubles~ but the reduction in weight and bulk are a major plus.     I don't like the ""trench foot"" effect of a vapor sock.  I think just letting your feet dry in your sleeping bag at night and always having dry liners to change to is  most reasonable.  If you had to go multiple days without a sock change would still be ok I feel.  As important is hydration and not letting other extremities get cold.     That being said it is worth also trying on the NEW Scarpa 6000.  They just fit differently.     I like the BOA as it was easy to change the fit during the day~ at least easier than laces it seemed.",Dec 2002,Mar 21 2016,0
1335,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,10, Well~ we (I) use to have similar issue~ sweaty sweaty... plastic bag around your foot is OK but we figured out something else: I use to put sanitary napkins into the boot!    Honestly~ try it out. Sanitary napkins~ lightweight and very absorbing!   It takes a shit lot of sweat and can be changed when necessary (usually once/ day).

I believe we are arguing the same point blah blah blah (""loose layers"" create gaps between your puffy~ insulation~ baselayer~ ect. filled with air your body heats up thats how warmth is created and stowed) and (the EVA boot is a vapor barrier in and of itself).... My point was La Sportiva engineers made a very fine boot you shouldn't need anything other than a wool sock IMO especially since I've been running these boots for the last year. However if you would like to run vapor ""to the 4th power"" barrier bullshit under you G2s feel free bro! IMO thats just not what LA SPORTIVA had in mind.

1344,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,2,19, Hello everybody! I've just used the G2 SM on Elbrus and this is my feedback~ hope you will find it useful:   First thoughts:   - I bought a new pair~ I normally wear 42-43~ my G2's are 44. Perfect fit with winter socks.   - I had to wear them for nearly 15 hours on the airplane towards Russia. No problem what so ever. Easy to wear~ easy to open and close. Especially compared to other bots that don't have the BOA system.    - I feel as if I had the perfect boots. I wore them in temperatures between -+25 Celsius and -20 Celsius and my feet felt perfect.    - During the night time I just put the inner boots in my sleeping bag and by morning they were dry and cozy. The EVA does not absorb sweat so they dry really fast. I think in the daytime you just need 15 minutes of sun (and positive temperatures) to dry the inner boot~ no matter how much your feet sweat.    First problems:   Well... to get right to the point... the BOA system failed. The steel cable just came of from the upper system. I nearly had a heart attack as this happened when I was in the Priut basecamp at 4100m.    I have put photos for you to see what happened. Fortunately I did not panic and improvised a quick DIY fix. Now I am still in vacation but as soon as I get home I will send La Sportiva a message with the pictures to see what they think about this problem and go back to the shop for a new pair.    I still want this boot. It's just to perfect to let it go because of a BOA failure. It's not La Sportiva's fault~ it's the BOA system that's not perfect.. as it seems. It's just to hard for me to get back to standard laces after spending these weeks up on Elbrus with the G2. I love these boots.    I will let you know what La Sportiva had to say about this problem. The wire just came out of the BOA The wire hanging out of the BOA  Quick fix: made a lasso to put it around the BOA Put a little bit of tape around the lasso to keep it from opening. broken and DIY fixed BOA system The lasso that made the difference between a failed expedition and a successful ascent.  G2 SM on Elbus 5642m~ with broken BOA and DIY fix. Perfect boots with BOA systems that still need user input and feedback to become fail proof. ....,Jul 2016,Jul 20 2016,0

1346,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,1, Hey all~ I rocked some G2 SMs for a 4 week trip to the Cordillera Blanca this summer. Here's some observations...   Pros:    Very light for long days with lots of elevation gain   Boa was very easy to dial in the right fit right when I needed it. Glacial travel - looser~ AI3 - tighten those bad boys up!   Feet stayed dry and toasty warm   Cons:   The boots are already showing quite a bit of wear! The fabric on the outside of the boot on the inside of my feet is almost halfway worn through already. It's the spot right where the rubber ends and the gaitor fabric starts. Same place where your ankle bone sticks out on the inside.    I had to get a thick insole put in the boot because my feet are skinny. Sinched all the way down~ my toes kept smacking the front of the toe box when I kicked. Solved with thick super feet soles.,May 2013,Aug 3 2016,0
1347,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,2, Wow lots of feedback from people who don't actually own G2 SMs!   I actually own G2 SMs and they are amazing boots.  Comfortable~ dry~ warm~ and they can climb.  They are pretty new so I haven't put much time on them since they are very new~ about 30 days~ but I have climbed 5-6000m peaks in them where they performed spectacularly.     Also~ the Boa system is pretty sweet in the fact that you can adjust them very quickly on the fly. They are perfect for slogging through glacial fields and then tightening up for pitched climbing.  I have indeed been worried that the wire would snap~ so I try not to crank on the knob too hard.  I found that once they are snug~ ratcheting the knob harder and hard doesn't do much more than put more stress on the cable.    I had Spantiks prior to these~ and there is very little comparison between the two other than the fact that they both fit similarly and are mostly yellow.  In no way~ shape~ or form~ are the G2 SM and the Baruntse/Spantik the same in class.,Mar 2016,Aug 3 2016,0
1348,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,3, I just got a few pair of these to try on and keep one~ for Elbrus~ and I am out of time!   How much heel lift should I have?  will it go away with use?   The 46 feel just a bit snug at the toes but I have no heel lift   The 46.5 feel fantastic in size~ however I have probably 1/2+ heel lift.    Any advice?   Thanks,Aug 2016,Aug 11 2016,0
1349,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,4, I just received a pair of G2 SM's - eventually intended for Denali~ but with some adventures beforehand. There's a lot of pros~ but a couple of cons too that I wanted to share and get thoughts on:   - I only see one mention of a boa failure above. Out of the box (although I have a suspicion they might have been 'tested' by someone else previously)~ one of the 4 boas on my pair was a little tricky to push in - looked like it was turning off-axis when trying to tighten~ and also skipping as though some internal teeth had been rounded down or something. After continued attempts to resolve it~ I guess I've rounded them down more - that boa won't tighten now.   - when I keep my foot flat on the ground~ and pivot forward at my ankle~ I can feel the boot dig into the top of ankle. I suspect this is because one boa secures the boot across the top of the foot~ while the other secures around the ankle - but there is no support bridging these two sections~ so the boot folds in at the junction of them~ and into the front of your ankle. That's my best effort at explaining it anyway - anyone notice a similar issue?,Sep 2016,Sep 16 2016,0
1350,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,5, On the failure.   Did the lace just come out of the reel or did it break?   If it just came out~ you can take a small screwdriver and open the reel and re-insert (BOA has great videos on this) and it will work as normal.  If it broke~ then a new lace has to be threaded.  The laces cost $4 each from BOA and a reel is $8.  Prolly a good idea to pack one of each for a trip~ just as you would pack a spare lace for any boot.,Nov 2016,Dec 2 2016,0
1351,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,6, It's so he can return them without them being all funked out.   The liner insulation is EVA (closed cell) so it shouldn't pickup that much moisture to affect insulation.  The only reason to use a VBL with these boots would maybe be to keep your thicker socks clean and dry~ you'll still need to clean the liner socks though.   I think these boots will probably replace the Spantics in the near future~ took a look at them last weekend~ they're sooo lite.  This might be a boot to look at if you're in my neck of the woods (Quebec).,Nov 2006,Dec 6 2016,0
1352,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,7, I picked up a pair of G2 SM boots from Mountain Gear.  I LOVE THESE BOOTS! Spent the last two days climbing waterfall ice and they perform great on technical ground.  The BOA is awesome and these are my first boots with an integrated gaiter so I love that too.  Highly recommended!,Jun 2013,Dec 20 2016,1
1353,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,8, Just got my pair of G2s today! Only the front bail of my grivel g14s don’t seem to fit so nice. Is there a wider bail? Or can someone suggest a crampon that fits better? Has anyone else ran into this problem?,Jan 2016,Dec 6 2017,0
1354,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,9, 2 things:  1) The upper BOA on my right foot failed in exactly the way that you mentioned. Unfortunately while up in Hyalite. Seemed off axis~ skipped teeth~ etc. I was able to get the dial to mostly tighten by exerting pressure axially while spinning (I pushed the dial down while turning....) but it didn't hold so I had to improvise. I know for a fact it broke when I simply tried to crank things down a little too hard. I've replaced it ($8) and now I just think about the boot a little differently. Basically~ I get them tight~ as tight as I would normally get a lace-up boot~ and nothing more. Even though technically the BOA~ unlike a lace-up~ let's me take the tightness to 11~ I only take it to 10. Digressing~ it's pretty goddamn Gucci but I love the fact that I can hone in and fiddle so quickly and easily. And they are super warm and climb and approach really well. For what I'm doing~ cost-benefit still puts these very high in the benefit column.  2) The digging in that you and others are experiencing is almost certainly due to the velcro closures on the inner boot. Quick fix is to secure the lower velcro further towards your toes~ and the upper velcro closure higher up your ankle. This creates space between the two velcro closures~ without which there is a pinch point. The longer term fix is to actually cut away a few cm from each strap (bottom of the upper strap and top of the lower strap) to create that space. Hope that works for you!

1357,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,12, Thank Gerrit.  I actually emailed BOA last week inquiring about spare parts - the rep stated that they do not have all the parts on their website because the G2SM uses an unusual lacing setup.  Thankfully~ they are sending me some spare parts.,Jun 2013,Jan 12 2018,0
1358,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,13, Boa faliures- I - had an initial issue with the boa lacing system and I contacted boa they sent me a few free reels and free laces and some tools for adjusting. -the next failure was my fault I was planning to just get up and walk across camp. so I stepped into the boots and zippered up the gator without cinching down the lacing system at all and it got caught in the zipper. I carry a small repair kit with one reel elase and a little tool for adjusting it was a pretty simple fix but it was quite worrying at ffirst.NEVER DO THAT. Other Notes on the Boot- - I feel that my insulation has worn out in it's warmpth a bit. Yet~ I often have river crossings on approach and this probably contributed significantly but just a warning. Overall I have really liked the boots ( and the stock insoles) and highly recommend them they start to look beat up quickly but still keep chugging along well even if they look ugly. For reference I have two~  month-long each trips on them where they were the only foot wear used and probably 2 and a half ice seasons on them. ,Oct 2015,Jan 12 2018,1
1359,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,14, Just received the boots today and goddamn they seem sweet. Works of art. REALLY hoping to take them to Peru in July.... The BOA concern seems manageable~ especially after seeing the great info in this thread. The other problem—the painful pressure point at the front of the ankle when the foot/boot bends—seems much more troubling.  It doesn’t seem to be the BOA wire causing the problem~ as it’s all above and below the ankle “hinge” when tightened. And it doesn’t seem like the velcro closure tabs on the liner either~ as Dan suggests. In my boot at least~ those aren’t at the pinch point and aren’t the culprit. The trouble comes from the fat~ rigid sewn lower seam where the more supple material is attached to allow the liner to flex. The secure hold of the BOA and the outer boot seem to make it so that the boot’s flex is exactly on this seam. The boot upper articulates forward and all the layers fold~ pressing this seam into a tender spot.  It seems like this could be a significant problem~ at least for me~ as I tend to find myself on   “endurance” ice or moderately steep neve—right at the sweet spot of pain in this boot. I know lots of folks love this boot~ and climb hard~ and do long trips in them. Is this not such a big thing to them? Any fixes~ aside from new liners at $175+? ,Mar 2018,Mar 21 2018,0

1362,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,17, Thanks Greg and Nick! Yeah Peru—can’t wait~ first trip! You guys are prob right about breaking them in~ I hope. I’m just hyper-wary of potential long term boot problems~ as I’m doing battle now with a separate problem caused by my ski boots~ and spreading to my regular~ formerly comfortable~ climbing boots.  Nick~ I’ve only worn them around them house~ doing laps clomping up and down the stairs. I want to keep the return option open as long as possible. Haha~ maybe I’ll take them to the gym like someone else above did and see how that works. Not weird at all! So Greg~ for you the problem just went away with time and usage? That seems encouraging. Has anyone had the problem persist to the point of being a deal breaker? ,Mar 2018,Mar 23 2018,0
1363,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,18, Fair enough.  What objectives do you have in mind? You could consider returning the G2SMs and trying the G5 boots - from what I've been told~ the G5s (formerly Batura 2.0) is warm enough for 6000m peaks in the Blanca. ,Jun 2013,Mar 23 2018,1
1364,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,3,19, We are planning to head into the Ishinca valley.

Ranrapalca would be the icing on the icing~ but probably a bit far fetched for our trip.  Thanks for the G5 suggestion. I’ll give it some thought. I’d love to have full-on doubles~ and the G2’s seem like the best. I’m going to see how they feel after a prolonged stair or gym machine session. Gonna get some looks I’m sure~ haha.

1365,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,0, Have you looked at the Arc'teryx boots? Lower profile doubles~ more like G5 sized.  Curious as to your thoughts on the Lowas. They supposedly make really nice stuff~ though those are a bit heavier.  I guess I sort of have a different inclination than the others. Mountaineering boots don't really stretch like rock shoes or hiking boots. If they suck trying them on for a few minutes I'm skeptical that it'll work itself out after a long day. Have you tried just taping a piece of foam at that tender spot to protect you from the seam?    ,Sep 2013,Mar 23 2018,0

1368,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,3, Thanks jdejace and Nick~ for input and for keeping this thread alive.  Jdjace~ I had given the Arc’teryx some thought~ but I’m looking to future goals of 6000-7000 meters~ and I want to error on the side of more than less~ warmth wise. I’ve got good circulation~ but man~ once I stop moving I get cold fast. Those look sweet though~ with solid reviews~ and this is the first time the dead bird item is cheaper than the others I’m looking at! Agreed with both of you on mtn boots not stretching~ but double boot liners packing out. And wondering if that process would soften the seam~ or just make it worse? Hard to say. Just seems like a bad omen to start with a problem out of the box.  Also~ I have not tried the foam pad fix just yet~ and I’m hoping not to need to~ but that’s a good idea. I’m going to keep trying with the G2’s—they’re just too perfect in every other way to give up on. I’ll post some thoughts and comparisons between the G2SM’s and the Lowa’s when I’ve got both in hand. I’ve had Lowa Mtn Expert EVO for 4 years—my entire mountaineering “career” haha—and they’re great. Solid construction~ warm~ stiff~ durable. I would hope to have a similar report about the 6000’s.

1376,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,11, Hi fellas~I know this is an old post but hoping my reply doesn’t fall on deaf ears. I’m currently in the process of picking up some G2’s for a trip to Nepal in October & have a few sizing questions for all you that currently own a pair. I have a size 9 (42) at home that I’m testing~ & a 9.5 (42.5) on the way. I’m a street shoe size 8.5~ but I found out the hard way (after losing a pinky toenail on a weekend trip & constantly banging my big toe on any long descents) I’m a size 9 in hiking boots.1) What is the acceptable amount of wiggle room in the toe box? In the size 9’s i can wiggle my toes just a lil but it’s pretty darn snug. Can’t overlap\cross  my big toe.2) Kicking steps~ should there be no feeling of the front of the boot at all? I can definitely feel I’m at the front of the boot~ but don’t get the toe nail banging or any real discomfort like in my hiking boots.3)Overall fit or tightness. Should the boot initially fit like a glove or should there be a lil room for swelling? The boot is really snug all over with just a heavy duty sock~ even a standard sock. I’m concerned it will be real tight after my feet possibly swell from altitude or late in the day after a trek. I have a couple days before the 9.5 boot arrives & I can compare it to the 9. But was hoping I could get some advice while I wait. Thanks in advance!,Jan 2018,May 19 2018,0

1379,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,14, Wore G2 SMs up Denali (West Buttress) from May 20th to June 7th~ 2018. They performed excellently. They fit true to size for my feet~ no need to size up or down compared to other footwear. I have a wide forefoot and the fit was good~ no pinchpoints for me like some have reported~ and no blisters. They also took old Black Diamond Contact strap crampons perfectly (chosen for good overboot fit and lack of technical climbing on the WB). Seems like one of the major criticisms of the boots is that they're not very durable~ but since the West Buttress involves no technical climbing or rough terrain I can't comment on that. I run hot and took overboots with me but did not need to use them. Costco midweight wool hiking socks worked well. Not totally sure on the lowest temperature encountered but we saw at least -20F / -30C overnight. The lacing~ zippers~ and shell of the boots performed great in the cold. I usually stored the shells in the tent vestibule and never had issues taking them off or putting them on.,Sep 2017,Jun 20 2018,0
1380,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,15," Glenn~ obviously it's hard to say over just hearing your description on the internet~ but it sounds like those are too small for you.  I find the I am very true-to-size with the G2 SM~ my foot measures exactly 42.5~ and I wear a 42.5 in the boot.  (""Street shoe"" is kind of hard to say~ most shoes don't fit true to size.) For me at least~ when I have the boots tightened properly~ I do not make contact with the front of the boot during kicks.  My boot is roomy enough to leave some wiggle room in the toes~ but snug enough to have almost no heel lift if the boas are tight.  For swelling~ remember that you can always mess with the boas a little bit.  Regardless of my sock choice~ thin or thick~ the boots fit 100%.  I wear either Smartwool's PhD Mountaineering or their Mountaineering Extra Heavy socks~ which are almost on the opposite sides of the spectrum thickness wise.  You should also note that the boots just may not work out for your foot shape~ no matter the size.  It could be beneficial to also give the Phantom 6000s a shot.  For me~ it was the opposite.  No matter what size~ the 6000s resulted in toe bang and/or heel lift.",Mar 2016,Jun 20 2018,0
1381,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,16, 2 things:  1) The upper BOA on my right foot failed in exactly the way that you mentioned. Unfortunately while up in Hyalite. Seemed off axis~ skipped teeth~ etc. I was able to get the dial to mostly tighten by exerting pressure axially while spinning (I pushed the dial down while turning....) but it didn't hold so I had to improvise. I know for a fact it broke when I simply tried to crank things down a little too hard. I've replaced it ($8) and now I just think about the boot a little differently. Basically~ I get them tight~ as tight as I would normally get a lace-up boot~ and nothing more. Even though technically the BOA~ unlike a lace-up~ let's me take the tightness to 11~ I only take it to 10. Digressing~ it's pretty goddamn Gucci but I love the fact that I can hone in and fiddle so quickly and easily. And they are super warm and climb and approach really well. For what I'm doing~ cost-benefit still puts these very high in the benefit column. 2) The digging in that you and others are experiencing is almost certainly due to the velcro closures on the inner boot. Quick fix is to secure the lower velcro further towards your toes~ and the upper velcro closure higher up your ankle. This creates space between the two velcro closures~ without which there is a pinch point. The longer term fix is to actually cut away a few cm from each strap (bottom of the upper strap and top of the lower strap) to create that space. Hope that works for you!

1382,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,17, I've got the G2s and have only used them once so far on an ascent of Cotopaxi~ Ecuador.  Got them coz I have bad circulation.  They held up well~ BUT for the pinching issue~ which was really uncomfortable on steep ascents and forced me to flat foot cross over when I did not really want to.  I'm trying to work that out right now.  The inner boot adjustment seems to help a little~ but I also just noticed the position of the inside riveted lace guide seems to be important.  It seems that both this and the stiff upper can dig into the foot~ it can be rotated to give about a centimetre more/less space~ and I have a feeling that I've had it poorly positioned.  I'm hoping that this will mostly solve the issue~ but have to try it out properly to check.  Fingers crossed,Jun 2018,Jun 20 2018,1

1384,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,4,19," I just got back from Banff~ and used the G2 SM the entire time (exception of heading down from the hut).  Everyone else had leather boots (lowa~ scarpas) and they did fine.  I was warm the entire time~ and was pleased to not have to stop on gaiters over top of my boot.  Almost too warm for the conditions I was in~ but while some people - very minor - were complaining about cold feet I had the ideal temp the entire time.   The plastic ankle issue that's been mentioned has gone away mostly after ""breaking in"" the boots~ and although it's still noticeable it isn't a detriment to the adventure.  I had an amazing time~ and I think the boots are part of the reason I had so much fun.  They are insanely light~ and wearing almost knee high socks (one pair) worked well for me since I was having some chaffing on my shins.   Overall~ extremely impressed~ and looking forward to giving them a test run around the white mountains this winter as well.",Apr 2018,Jun 23 2018,0

1392,La Sportiva G2 SM.

1393,La Sportiva G2 SM. Any input,5,8," I agree and disagree with others.  My boots were overkill when I was in banff~ but while some people were complaining about cold feet~ I wasn't at all~ ever.  While it was -5 to + 5 C where I was~ I was still walking through 2 feet of snow and didn't have to worry about boots getting wet or cold the entire time.   I'll have to take a look at the rotation that Fergus mentioned...but for the weight and warmth factor I'm super happy with my purchase.  To agree with others these boots are likely overkill when it isn't below zero temps.  It comes down to personal preference unfortunately in some cases~ and at $800 I can understand starting out with a cheaper pair of boots and working your way up.  I'm not upset with my boots at all~ but might have to look for a boot that's less ""intense""  if there is more trail than snow and the temp doesn't justify them. La sportiva is likely the brand to go with.   Oh as an aside~ it could just be mental~ but having mine heat molded was a game changer!  The boots definitely started to feel better afterwards~ so i'd recommend having that done. ",Apr 2018,Jun 25 2018,1

1436,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,1,5, I love the device.  It works a lot better than a Mammut Smart or GriGri for feeding out rope and more dynamic for trad climbing. I tested it with my hefty buddy jumping off a climb and it held him every time with very minimum slippage.,Sep 2001,Jun 22 2014,0
1437,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,1,6, I have logged about 60+ days on my mega-jul on sport/trad/multipitch rock~ and I feel that it is a very versatile and good device and definitely a 'next step' in belay devices.    The biggest drawback for me is that if using a rope 10 mm or bigger for 'guide mode' top belaying~ it can give you gnarly belayers elbow because of the really high friction...but with skinnier ropes it's a dream.   Also i often flip it over when rappelling so that it functions like a standard ATC because even when trying to use a carabiner as a 'handle' for rappelling with it in standard mode~ i still couldn't get it to run smoothly~ and if you just crank on the wire to rappel you can pop it out of the device (again this is on fat ropes)   I'd definitely recommend buying one though~ they're awesome,Jul 2011,Jun 22 2014,0
1438,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,1,7, Jim~ thank you for the clarification. Everyone~ thank you for the responses~ and I believe the MegaJul is the route we're headed... pun intended,Apr 2014,Jun 22 2014,0
1439,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,1,8," As discussed in the thread on the Alpine Up~ the reason the MegaJul can't be certified as an locking assisted device but rather is ""only"" a manual locking device is because it cannot automatically stop a factor-2 fall without the correct manual intervention of the belayer.  The UIAA test the device would have to pass to get assisted locking certification looks like this:  UIAA test set-up for locking belay devices~ theuiaa.org/upload_area/cer…   and with no brake hand to move the braking strand above the device there will be no braking effect.  This is the same for all ATC-style devices~ the Mammut Smart and Smart Alpine~ and the Click Up and Alpine Up.  The UIAA certification thus does not distinguish between the behavior of the ATC-XP and Reverso on the one hand and the more vigorous braking actions of the Smarts~ Ups~ and MegaJuls---they are all lumped together as manual locking devices in spite of the substantial differences between them when it comes to holding non-factor-2 leader falls.   Personally~ I wouldn't be in a rush to embrace the MegaJul. As a counterpoint to the raves here~ I know a handful of people who have tried them and don't like them.  Its performance appears to depend a great deal on rope diameter and the carabiner that is used~ so it is a bit hard to know what you are actually getting.  It is known to be hard on carabiners~ and the earlier models had quality-control problems (these may now have been fixed however).  The primary advantages seem to be light weight~ small size~ and modest price.",Feb 2008,Jun 22 2014,0

1457,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,5, Background: My wife bought me one for my birthday. I was following the old thread where the wire kept pulling out~ but was hesitant to get one because of this.  It appears quality control in the early batches has been corrected now.     For the first few days climbing with it I carried by trusty Reverso 4 because I didn't trust  the new device yet.  Multiple days of cragging and multipitch has made me a believer.  The device catches falls nearly on its own.  In guide mode with my 9.5 or 9.4 it works great.  If someone is hang dogging~ it locks up and stays right there.  The climber doesn't slowly creep down because you moved your hand an inch.  On twin ropes (~8.2 I think) it was effortless to belay in regular and guide mode~ but still locked up nicely.  Flipping it around (non locking mode) works great for faster raps (feels like a normal ATC)~ but if you are untangling rope that didn't get tossed perfectly~ the locking mode is really nice (although a bit jerky for rappel) because you can be a bit more hands free to deal with a cluster (probably should still back up though).  It top ropes fine~ and lead belay is awesome.  Additionally since it is made of steel rather than aluminum it doesn't heat up as much and should last longer than most other devices.     I didn't pay for it but would gladly buy another.   Also people keep comparing it to a GriGri.  It is nothing like a GriGri.  It is cheaper~ allows you to rappel on it~ weighs less~ and has no moving parts to get stuck.  Teach your girlfriend to belay with an ATC and you will be happier in the long run~ but this will be a nice assist device to help her catch your whippers.  IMO,May 2011,Jun 22 2014,0
1458,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,6," couple quick points...at a rock gym here in boulder~ every single (as of a couple years back) groundfall they'd had~ had been with a GriGri...just fyi.    the wire issue has indeed been fixed on the megajul.    flip the unit around when rappelling (thumb loop/wire facing you~ instead of away~ as when lead-belaying) and it rappels just fine. i've used everything from 8.7 single to 10.0....   as for using skinnier ropes when belaying a second to avoid ""belayer's elbow~"" be extremely careful when using skinnier cords. under the right (wrong) circumstances~ the rope can flip (meaning the climber's strand ends up on the bottom~ not the top) and then things get interesting quick. now--a GiGi or even ATC/Reverso can do the same thing~ so it's not a design flaw~ but rather an issue one should be aware of when belaying a single follower.    more on this~ including video and input from an IFMGA guide here: elevationoutdoors.com/blogs…   and lastly~ i'd agree with the poster regarding more time spent coaching/practicing~ too. technique is key; the megajul a nice backup in things go sideways~ for whatever reason.    i personally like the megajul~ my only gripe being autoblocking/belaying a single follower issue (see above link)......   good luck!",Sep 2009,Jun 22 2014,0

1463,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,11, Well I prised myself out of my armchair a few years ago and built maybe 50 different prototypes of this kind of plate~ in the end we made an adjustable jig so we could move the two rope contact points about and vary the wedging ange of the karabiner. I never got better results than a conventional plate so we shelved the idea when I ran off the development budget.   The problem here is it´s a very fine balance how far onto the bottom contact point the karabiner goes as naturally the rope tries to force it back and the only force available is from the position of the top contact point and the angle of the wedging face. Basically the karabiner has to end up half-way on top of the lower entry radius and so compared with a conventional plate or tube type device the karabiner has to be much further into the device so the rope bends around the karabiner and the plate entry exit are considerably smaller. Since most of the braking power comes from the bends the power is lost.    For an ATC XP the entry angle is around 90°~ the karabiner wrap 140° and the exit angle 45°~ for the MegaJul the numbers are approximately 30°~ 100° and 20°and with a thinner rope and under full tension probably lower still~ I shall have to measure this more exactly sometime.   Camp tried to increase the pressure between the karabiner and the bottom pin by adding a Vee slot to the upper exit when they made the YoYo but whether it worked I´ve no idea!   The Alpine Up has a little nose that drives under the karabiner which is a good idea EXCEPT it makes releasing under tension even harder~ a handling balancing act all this type have anyway~ ten years ago nobody would have accepted a belay device where you need to use a karabiner to lever it open to lower or abseil and many of us still don´t feel this is progress.   It´s the sheer depth of things like the ATC XP which makes them work so well and why tube type devices are so good~ the Reverso³ ought to be better looking at the slot design but shaving the height makes it actually a worse performer.,Nov 2009,Jun 23 2014,0
1464,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,12, This is exactly the theoretical mathematical bullshit I'm talking about.  Go out to your local sport crag where your partner is going to fall a lot and actually use a MegaJul.  It will autolock and catch your falling leader every time.  I've actually used the device for a couple of months now and that is my real life experience with the device.  I don't know the exit or entry angle.  I don't really care.  It caught the leader every time on some pretty big whippers.  That is what you should care about. Is it fool-proof? No. No device is but if your belayer is inattentive or gets hit in the head with a rock it is a nice to have an auto-locking/assisted-locking device instead of the rope screaming uncontrolled through the ATC.   ,Sep 2001,Jun 23 2014,0

1468,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,16," Jim~     I'm wondering if you have data that can correlate effectiveness of the ""locking assist"" vs fall factors.  And how does this data compare to ATC Guide and Reverso 3?  I think this may be valuable.  Yes~ high fall factor falls do happen.  But~ how does this device perform for climbers that understand and are able to practically eliminate high fall factors.  Also~ any device that slips~ negates the theoretic fall factor 2.  Perhaps this slippage leads to a 1.9 or 1.8 or lower.  I can't say for sure~ which is still a very high fall factor.",Apr 2006,Jun 23 2014,0

1471,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,19, RichieRich.  If you're speaking only of single pitch climbing~ a GriGri is probably a far better alternative.  I actually use a GriGri for all of my cragging and sport climbing.  For multi-pitch climbing though the MegaJul is hard to beat. Its light.  It has never failed to lock for me(with ropes from 8m doubles and 9.3 - 9.8 singles).  Using it in guide mode with ropes 9.8 and under is really not much different than an ATC or similar.  Last but not least~ using it in Tuber mode has always worked perfectly for me on multiple rappels.  I'm using it with a BD Mini-Pearbiner.,Oct 2011,Jun 23 2014,0

1483,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,3,11, For others interested in this~ Jim hasn’t got (or at least hasn’t shared) a mathematical model of assisted braking belay device performance.  I don’t think reboot’s works for a number of reasons~ but that discussion isn’t relevant here because we are not debating  mathematical models.     Jim has some load measurements and some physical explanations in terms of rope angles in the devices.   He is~ I believe~ using the term power the way reboot has used efficiency~ i.e. how much the device multiplies the applied hand force.  His tests so far suggest that at high loads~ the tested assisted-locking devices actually have a lower hand-force multiplication factor then an ATC-XP.   My understanding—which may be all wrong in which case Jim will~ in the fullness of time~ correct it—is that the assisted locking action can occur before the carabiner travels all the way to its highest possible position in the slot.  If this happens~ and if the load increases enough~  the carabiner is pulled further up~ which decreases various rope bend angles and so decreases the “power” of the device.  Perhaps it isn’t simply a question of carabiner position up or down the slot but also a question of the angle of the belay device under increasing loads~ and perhaps both of these possibilities work in concert.   The consequences of all this aren’t clear to me at the moment.  I don’t know whether Jim has taken static measurements at an increasing range of loads or somehow studied the dynamics of the device behavior under high fall-factors.  I don’t know how much the decreases in “power” might actually matter.  If they do matter~ I don’t know what the comparison is between rope run through an ATC and rope run through an assisted locking device for high fall factors.  The assisted-locking feature might force the rope to absorb more fall energy before running and so lead to less rope running through the device when it does run~  even though the power of the device is less at that point.  Or~ on the other hand~ the rope running after a momentary apparent locking could be a surprise that causes the belayer to lose control.   Most of us think of a belay device as a simple gadget that adds friction and so multiplies grip strength by some constant.  Indeed~ quite a few papers have been written on belay dynamics include this assumption.  But as the devices get more complicated~ this assumption may no longer be valid~ if it ever was~ and this is what Jim’s results so far are suggesting.  Whether those results have practical consequences for adopting such devices~ and/or whether those results inform the way the devices are employed~ remains to be seen.,Feb 2008,Jun 24 2014,0
1484,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,3,12," the mammut smart (and alpine smart) is NOT autolocking ... it provides an assisted lock ... you treat it like an ATC+ and always keep your hand on the brake (which you should with a gri gri as well)   it can and will slip should the rope be thin enough~ new and slick enough~ etc ...   on a single line rap on a mammut 9.5 or beal 9~7 it does slip ....   on falls it locks most of the time~ but there will be times when it does slip   IMO on ""normal"" falls its provides more breaking power than an ATC ... and on a 10mm rope which i use for most things it locks more reliably   i own and use all versions of the smart extensively every day   ive used the megajul somewhat when my partners have em ... it feeds and works around the same as the smart IMO ... but rapping on the assisted mode is a biatch without unless you use that biner as lever   and the autoblock is a biatch on anything approaching 10mm ropes   the alpine smart pulls through the device in autoblock like buttah   i havent had the opportunity to test either in high factor falls on real rock ... thank god   but i would definitely like to see the actual data on these braking device on such falls   ;)",Mar 2009,Jun 24 2014,0

1489,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,3,17," Jim~ thanks for posing up all the info.  I really appreciate it.  Just to make sure that I am clear~ you are saying that the Jul / Smart will hold a ""small"" fall with less hand force from the belayer that an ATC.  However~ an ATC will hold a ""bigger"" fall with less hand force from the belayer that a Jul / Smart.  Is this accurate?  Also~ do you know at what point the Jul / Smart requires more hand force that an ATC?   In my experience with the Smart~ the exit angle of the rope from the device makes a big difference in the amount of hand force from the belayer that is required.  If directly under the first piece~ less hand force from the belayer is required.  The greater the angle between the belayer and the first piece~ the greater the amount of  hand force from the belayer that is required.   Edit to add...   performance in factor 2 falls is not something that I am concerned about.  I set up belays so that a Factor 2 is a VERY low probability.  I always have the rope running through a piece above me~ so a factor 1.9? is about as big as I will ever need to hold.  If I am worried about a true factor 2 (which is virtually never)~ I will use a grigri.  My concern is generating stopping power where the direction of pull is up.",Dec 2009,Jun 24 2014,0

1498,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,6, On further inspection the reason the locking force doesn´t increase with an increasing load has nothing to do with rope dynamics or anything technical~ the karabiner is physically unable to move nearer the pressure point. On the MegaJul it stops leaving an eye shaped hole 6mm high and more or less as wide as the slot~ on the Smart it´s bigger so it´s just a matter of how much effort it takes to pull a rope through a hole this big. There´s a reason that both Edelrid and Mammut have to make different plates for larger and smaller ropes.,Nov 2009,Jun 25 2014,0

1500,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,8," This is a fascinating and slightly troubling discussion.    If I understand correctly~ in a ""traditional"" ATC device (paired with a particular rope and caribiner)~ the amount of friction created is fairly constant~ created by large bends in the rope. The ""slippage point"" is reached when the forces in the fall are great enough to overcome the combined friction in the system and grip strength of the belayer.   On an ""assisted braking"" device - the Smarts and Juls - there is actually a change in the amount of friction that depends on the interaction between the biner~ device and rope. As the rope pulls~ the biner is forced into a position that pinches the rope between the device and the biner~ and increases the bends int he rope. However~ theoretically (but not yet tested)~ a large and sudden enough force can cause the device to fail to engage in a way that the friction is minimized rather than maximized. Similar to the problem that the Cinch had when it did not engage at high factor falls.   Am I getting this right? ",Mar 2006,Jun 25 2014,0

1503,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,11," I just tried to explain~ perhaps incorrectly but surely not all that unclearly~ that what Jim is saying does not necessarily mean the rope will go ""streaming through the MegaJul.""   There are plenty of people out there who will tell you the rope doesn't run through a ATC either in their experience~ but there is no question at this point that it will in a big fall with high fall-factor and little system friction.  One of the problems with these discussions is the difference~ already present before ""assisted locking"" devices entered the picture~ between the behavior of belay devices in ""ordinary"" circumstances and ""extreme"" circumstances.  Most folks have never had to deal with an ""extreme"" circumstance and end up claiming the device behavior associated with such circumstances doesn't happen.   The situation with ""assisted lockers"" is further muddied by the fact that they are new and so experience from the field~ is even less likely to have exposed issues and anomalies.   By the way~ I say all this as someone who has used and promoted ""assisted locking"" devices (I use the Alpine Up) for about two years now.",Feb 2008,Jun 25 2014,0

1525,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,5,13," One thing those numbers suggest is that you cannot count on the MegaJul as a locking rappel device for a single strand rappel on a 9mm rope~ especially near the end of a rappel with little rope weight on it~ because with zero or near zero grip strength (i.e. you've let go of the rope)~ the thing starts to slip at about 70 kgf = 154 lbf.  The Smart would be even worse~ with an untended slip threshold of about 40 kgf = 88 lbf.

1529,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,5,17, I think I have learned a lot from this thread.  However~ not being a physicist and having had trouble with the few applied physics classes I took many years ago~ I am not sure that I am understanding the real world ramifications of the data that Jim posted.  With that in mind~ can one of you smart guys (Rgold or Jim) answer a few questions for me?   The graph shows that a fall generating ~150KG of force on the belay will require ~22KG of had force to stop when using a Smart / Jul.  If one tried to catch a fall that generated 170KG of force on the belay with ~22KG of had force~ would the rope slip a little bit and then stop as the force dissipated~ or would the rope continue to slip and the belayer be completely unable to stop the fall?   I don't use a GriGri for trad because of the higher impact forces it generates.  Assuming that the Smart / Jul will only slip a limited amount before stopping~ wouldn't the slip actually beneficial in certain circumstances where you are climbing above marginal gear and want a soft catch?

1540,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,6,8, In any case~ the Alpine Smart and MegaJul~ whatever their good points~ are just plain inferior to the Alpine Up when it comes to half-rope handling~ and since  I use half ropes almost all the time~ the Smart and Jul~ and anything else that ties up the brake hand the way they do~ are never going to be the device of choice for me.,Feb 2008,Jun 27 2014,0

1543,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,6,11," I'm sure it ""works fine~"" just not as well as the Alpine Up.  Look~ there's a handle on the Smart and Jul because~ in at least some circumstances~ pumping slack to the leader requires the device be levered away from the belayer's body to keep the device from grabbing.  With half ropes and the fairly common need to take one in while paying one out~ tying up the brake hand on that handle means the other hand has to be pumping one strand and switching over and around to take in the other strand.  This is at the very best awkward~ and is prone to leave more slack in the leader's ropes~ resulting~ in some cases~ in an elimination of one of the advantages of half rope technique.   When you have only one rope to manage~ fine~ but with two ropes heading through the device in opposite directions~ the Alpine Up~ which doesn't restrict what the belayer can do with their hands~ is simply a better solution.

1548,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,6,16, There a bit shy about actually publishing any real results for their belay devices~ something most manufacturers are guilty of.   Us Smart users will just have to accept;- By “braking force support” we mean that in a fall the device exerts most of the braking action itself~ virtually locking the device.   The shape and geometry of the Smart Alpine provides dynamic braking of the rope in order to minimize impact on the fallen climber and the equipment~ so the belayer only needs to apply a small amount of force to lock the rope completely in the belay device.   It is true that the Smart Alpine is designed to exert an enormous braking effect on the rope~ virtually locking it.....   Or not.,Nov 2009,Jun 27 2014,0

And why is any of this interesting? Well if you are using half ropes you often get in the situation where only one strand is actually going to be loaded in a fall and the original objective was to find out how well we can grip two strands when only one is loaded. The Italian Alpine Club and hazarded an opinion of about 40% reduction in braking force but didn´t really test it as such~ just noted it when doing some other testing.   I went a bit further and tried to see what I could hold leaving slack in one strand and then as it slid through seeing what the two-strand force was. The reason for purchasing the Smart was in the hope it would improve matters!   The test is of nescessity not very accurate~ there are limits to how much rope sliding through my hand I enjoy. That´s also why the BRD and Reverso³ don´t get included.  Two strand hand gripping   The 7.8 results are particularly poor~ partly because the ropes are reasonably new and still smeared with some slippery stuff in case I was ever stupid enough to go climbing in the wet and cold and partly because I have strong but large hands~ someone smaller might be able to grip the things better.,Nov 2009,Jun 29 2014,0

1577,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,8,5," While I appreciate the discussion and have found it to be very interesting~ I have nothing but praise for this device.  I am happy with how its performed for me in many settings.  I have used it extensively sport climbing in Greece and Turkey for over a month catching many falls and easily lowering on a 9.5 Edelweiss Energy.  It always locked and performed as advertised.  As I got better using it~ it became even easier to use.  I've used it with a 9.3 and a 9.8 Mammut rope on trad climbing routes extensively as well. Its always worked very well and has consistently caught falls.  It has worked very well climbing alpine multipitch and long multipitch in Red Rock with a set of 8.2 Mammut Double Ropes.  It caught a long fall on a single strand of those doubles with no issue.  I have rappelled with it ""backwards"" on many pitches using a backup and it has performed flawlessly.  I have used it in guide mode on Multipitch climbs on many occasions with all the ropes listed and it has always worked no problem. I know several other folks that I've run into in the field~ who have made similar comments.  I have also run into a few folks that have commented that they didn't like it early into their adoption of the Jul and went back to an ATC or other device.    That said~ I'm not hearing from many people other than ""I know a guy who knows a guy"" type stories of the device performing other than advertised.  I find Weston's question appropriate.  Does it hold falls and is it easy to use?  In my and many others experience it does and it is. although there can be a learning curve. I've heard no direct reports from someone saying it didn't hold a fall.",Oct 2011,Jul 2 2014,0

1589,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,8,17," Jim~   Thanks for the great tests and data.  Is there a way to superimpose fall forces onto your graphs so we can get a better ideal of how these results correlate to the real world?   I realize fall forces vary greatly with the factors involved including climber weight~ belayer weight~ fall factors and much more.  But~ perhaps using an 80 kg climber and an anchored belayer with varying fall factors for a simplified view.   From your graphs~ it appears most devices~ with most ropes are more than adequate (simplified conclusion) with single pitch and ""Unanchored"" belayers since the belay holding force only needs to be greater than the belayers weight since the belayer will be airborne if the force required to arrest the fall exceeds their body weight~ whether this is desirable or not.   So~ this discussion really pertains to a multi pitch scenario where high fall factors or an ""anchored"" belay exists.  Furthermore~ factor 2 is not really relevant since the rope slips in all of these devices making the factor 2 impossible.  For example~ a leader 5 feet above the belay falls 10 feet on 5 feet of rope:  10/5= ff 2.  But~ only 1 foot of rope slippage through the device yields:  11/6= ff 1.8 . Although 1.8 is still very high and should be avoided at all costs~ the mythical ff 2 does not really exist with devices the have ""slippage"".",Apr 2006,Jul 3 2014,0
1590,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,8,18," Greg~ once the rope slips through the belay device under tension~ the entire fall-factor construction is no longer appropriate for discussing peak loads and it is of no theoretical~ much less practical use.  You can think of the fall factor as being related to what the peak load would be without such slippage~ but that's as far as it goes. (The fall factor is still relevant if you just put a certain amount of slack in the rope~ however.)  Because of the relationship between fall factor and peak loads~ we do know that the likelihood of rope slippage goes up as the fall factor goes up.   In most discussions~ ""fall factor 2"" is a shorthand for a fall the belayer has to hold without the rope running through any intermediate protection.  As far as peak loads are concerned~ there is hardly any difference between fall factor 2 and~ say~ fall factor 1.8 anyway.",Feb 2008,Jul 3 2014,0
1591,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,8,19, rgold~ thanks for that reply and I understand.  Ignoring my comments about fall factors~ I still would like to see fall forces laid over these graphs to put it in perspective.     For example~ a 100 kg belay force can only resist a 100 kg fall is there is zero friction between belayer and climber.  But~ as soon as you introduce points of protection between belayer and cimber and friction on biners and over the rock~ a 100 kg belay force can arrest a higher fall force.,Apr 2006,Jul 3 2014,0

Ignore the unlabelled curve above the MegaJul one. 7.8mm twin   Roughly follows the same general pattern~ the more assist at the start the less increase with hand force. It´s a bit weak if only one strand is loaded but otherwise powerful enough.

1631,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,1,19, Once the rope starts slipping under tension~ how much slippage occurs depends not on the fall factor but on the height of the fall~ and of course on how much resisting force the rope is slipping against.  So giving a slippage number~ even theoretically~ requires more data.     I don't know what happens with the assisted locking devices if the rope is already slipping through it (this does appear to be inevitable for big impacts) and then the climber lets go.  Neither the MegaJul nor the Smart seem to provide much in the way of hands-off resistance; the only device that appears to do that is the Alpine Up.  Until further evidence comes in~ I'd guess the assisted lockers will drop a falling leader if they start to slip and the leader lets go.  So you still need belay gloves~ maybe even more so than with an ATC-XP.     There is this video of the Alpine Up catching a factor 0.8 fall with a 70 kg weight on double 8mm ropes unattended and without much rope weight on the brake side~ which would make one think it can withstand a higher almost-zero-grip impact load then the 463 lbf (2 kN) in Jim's graph~ so that makes one wonder whether there might be something different about dynamic performance as opposed to slow pulling.

1663,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,11," Thanks for the read guys and especially thanks to Rich and Jim for some real analysis that was educational.   I took home some important refreshers of things that should be useful to all safe climbers.   1. While not all F2 or similar severe falls can be anticipated you and your belayer should be totally prepared to deal with all consequences and not be trusting your belay device to save you. Your belayer has to do it.   2. Muscle memory of the belayer takes over when a climber falls. This is a reminder to all of us to practice and assiduously use proper belaying technique with all these devices. Bad muscle memory or panic leads to bad outcomes. No device can overcome a belayer with bad habits or incomplete understanding.   3. Assisted locking devices are useful for holding hanging climbers and for minimizing fatigue for belayers and may give some (false) confidence to leaders...but are no substitute for proper knowledge~ experience or technique and will not stop severe falls. Only brake hands will.   4. Ergo: Belay gloves are good.   5. Fools are able to defeat any ""foolproof"" device.   In 40+ years of being in and out of climbing I have survived being dropped at least 3 times~ once in the gym (not hurt)~ once by belayer (nasty hand injury for him but he saved my life) and one 100' fall to the end of the rope (only meagre scratches)... Don't think it won't happen to you IT WILL HAPPEN if you keep climbing (we are humans~ not robots) and we can only minimize the incidence through attention to all details~ despite it seeming to ruin the fun through pedantic caution. It is often people getting casual/lazy/a little too comfortable that leads to trouble. The ""expert"" and ""beginner"" are equally at risk in this regard. Don't kid yourself.",Aug 2012,Dec 11 2016,0
1664,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,12, Thanks for all the info~ everyone. Jim~ thanks for sharing your testing results. Forgive me if I have overlooked something while reading the thread but there seems to be something missing from the discussion here. Kilogram is not a unit of force. Are we all talking about Newtons? Not trying to be pedantic - I would really like to use the data for kinematic calculations that approximate real life situations. I also second shoo's request for the raw data - I doubt it is all still lying around but in the future it would be extremely helpful.

1665,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,13, I use kgf often as the numbers are easier to understand for things like belay devices~ if I say a belay hand force of 25kg then everyone can tie a 25kg weight onto a rope and see what it feels like to hold~ writing 0.25kN force on the belayer side rope would mean nothing to most people. That it is force is defined in the caption. The raw data is utterly uninteresting~ it either an endless stream of csv values which I tell my computer to do something with or me eyeballing a digital readout and making a judgement about when the value has settled down enough to be an accurate reflection of the forces I am seeing. Rather than re-analysing my data the engineers out there would be better employed actually running some tests themselves to get independent results.,Nov 2009,May 1 2017,0

Well~ in climbing~ lbf (pounds force) and kgf (kilograms force) are often used as an approximation of force.  You could convert it to Newtons easily if you like. Since F=ma~ force in Newtown~ mass in kg~ acceleration in meters/s^2. Simply multiply kg x 10 to get Newtons.  (9.81 if you want to be more precise),Apr 2006,May 1 2017,0
1667,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,15, I only read a couple pages of this thread but haven't seen this mentioned yet; as someone who owns a megajul and has used it several days in single and multi-pitch terrain~ I would not recommend buying one. The device tends to twists the rope(s) more than a guide ATC. As mentioned repeatedly~ it's not in the same class as a gri-gri so it's hard to really compare. If you're looking for something comparable to a gri-gri maybe try an Alpine-up,May 2011,May 1 2017,0
1668,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,2,16, Thanks for clarifying that Jim and Greg. I was unfamiliar with kgf and was unsure whether the gravitational constant was included in the force measurements or not. I am very curious now to try the MegaJul with a 10mm rope. With ~135 kgf provided hands free (assuming it engages)~  a 70 kg (155 lbs) climber at height d above his last piece of protection should come to a stop within about 2d below that piece if the protection holds and there is about 1 meter of slack. For the areas I climb the only place I would really be concerned about this is below the third bolt as their might not be 2d before ground.,Jun 2016,May 1 2017,0

1677,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,3,5, Didn't bother reading entire above thread just gonna add my experience: I own a mega jul and I love it.  It does exactly what I expect in that it is an assisting lock device.  It has never failed to lock up/ catch a fall~ but of course just like a grigri I always keep my brake hand on.  I love how light it is for alpine~ and that I can repell on multipitch ect.  Although it sucks to repell in locking mode~ just turn it around and use a prusik.  I also like that it can be used in guide mode.  (I understand people belay with a grigri directly of an ancho but that's not technically recommended~ whatever).  It can be a little jerky on rapell or when lowering a partner~ not too bad just not as smooth as an atc~ worth it imo. One other thing is its now good for jugging a line~ I like to jug a line with 1 ascender and 1 grigri~ and the mega jul won't replace the grigri here.   ,Apr 2015,Jun 26 2017,0

Jim~ please correct me if I've misunderstood!  With a few exceptions all devices allow a bit of slip~ the ideal situaltion is that the device is powerful enough that the belayer can reduce slip to a minimum OR allow however much they feel is required to protect marginal gear when ice climbing for example or to allow the faller to pass the lip of the roof they have just climbed. The half-automatic devices generally give the worst of both worlds~ that is the braking power is often less than one would wish for but it´s effect is hard to modulate for the belayer. With a conventional device of sufficient power one can allow considerably more slippage under control without danger of rope burns as the need to grip the rope hard is reduced.,Nov 2009,Jul 20 2017,0

We do not have control over the route and rock as much as we would like to think and cannot engineer ideal situations on the spot when confronted with a FF2 event. These are almost always going to be unexpected and the result of gear placement failure~ rock breakage~ rock fall etc. All we can do is use safe tools that give us a chance of surviving them~ if you aren't using a safe tool tragedy may result. Never waste time thinking about whether or not you should or shouldn't clip the anchor as if that is going to make the difference.

1704,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,12, There's a lengthy discussion on Supertopo about whether or not clipping the anchor is a good idea~ see http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=731822&tn=180. In terms of just the anchor load~ clipping the anchor will usually result in a considerably higher anchor load than a factor 2 fall~ with a break-even point occurring when the leader is still very close to the anchor in most cases (it of course depends on how far below the anchor the belayer is situated).  But belayer distance from the anchor isn't the only issue~ there is also the question of whether the belayer is anchored down or could collide with the anchor~  whether slippage through the belay device is possible~ and if it is~ whether the belayer can manage it.   The era I grew up in as a climber~ when it was relatively common in the US to practice catching high fall factor falls with weights~ is now a distant memory.  Most belayers have not experienced anything close to such falls and have no idea how they might perform or what adjustments in their technique might improve that performance.  Extensive experience on the kinds of moderate falls that are typical~ especially in sport climbing~ provides no insight into the extreme situations and may lead to unjustified confidence.  Moreover~ there is an assumption that belay technology is up to the task~ but this assumption is questionable at best and demonstrably false in some cases.  Deciding not to clip the anchor~ in spite of the advantages in terms of anchor load~ means relying on belay skills that might not exist. Modern bolted anchors can take whatever the situation can dish out~ but there is a bit more to worry about for trad anchors~ which could conceivably be overwhelmed by very high loads.  In my 60 years of climbing~ I've heard or read of about such total anchor failures approximately every five years. Except for one miraculous case~ all such failures have resulted in the death of the party.  Such extreme falls are so rare that we have essentially no empirical information on the reliability of trad anchors in general for such circumstances.   I 'm not persuaded by the argument that there is really no problem because if you are thinking about the issue at all~ you have a bad anchor and should do something about that.  Personally~ I've felt forced to belay from anchors I judged questionable on a number of occasions.  I absolutely did not clip them~ and discussed with the leader that I would be belaying dynamically in the original sense of the word~ which means deliberately allowing some slippage through the belay device.  But this is something I've actually practiced with weights and know how to do.  Obviously~ this is a leader must not fall situation~ but embracing the optimum belay strategy for it seems to me to make more sense than just accepting that the leader isn't going to blow it. It seems fairly well known by now that the best strategy for such situations is to get the belayer far from the anchor and have the leader clip the anchor~ but this isn't always possible; it depends on the terrain below the belay stance.,Feb 2008,Jul 21 2017,4
1705,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,13," ""You are talking about avoiding high-force falls~ not managing them. Avoiding such falls as far as possible has always been standard practice in climbing~ if one should occur then using a belay device which gives the best chance of a satisfactory outcome seems an intelligent idea.""""  Hi Jim---I'm talking about both----you avoid them first and foremost~ but if put in a position where one is possible~ then you manage (maybe ""mitigate"" is a better word?) it via anchor placement~ where/if you clip the anchor~ and even putting a catastrophe knot in the brake strand of the rope. My reasoning for posting on it was as a reminder that we should avoid high-force falls in the first place and not overemphasize a technological fix! We see this a lot when discussing gear (nylon vs. dyneema~ belay devices~ etc.)~ some basic strategies could do a lot to manage certain situations~ rather than the ""latest greatest"" device..... Having less experienced people belay~ at this point~ I think you're leaning towards the Click Up as one of the your favorites~ yes? I wonder how it would react if a belayer held a truly factor 2 fall---that is~ the climber fell past the belayer and the pull on the Click Up was down and not up...that would be hard to test~ I assume~ eh?!  And the 24-million-dollar question! I wonder if you've done any testing regarding when/if to clip the anchor as the leader leaves the stance? It seems generally accepted that clipping the masterpoint or highest/best piece is a good strategy to avoid a factor2 fall.....but imagine if the climber goes 8m above the anchor and then falls----the clipped masterpoint acts as a 2:1 pulley at that point~ correct~ doubling forces on the anchor? The fall factor must approach 2 at that point~ yes? So----at what point is it better to unclip from the anchor and reduce forces? Is it better?  As you have probably long since realized---I am no physics expert and can't even fathom a guess! Thanks Jim!  Like any device except the Grigri and it´s relatives the ClickUp doesn´t do anything faced with FF2 unless the belayer changes to brake hand up~ then it should work like anything else. Hands-free (as in the paranoic but seldom encountered horror scenario of a disabled belayer) the ClickUp like all the rest does absolutely nothing~ that is the difference between the test for the European standard~ Cat 1 devices have to stop a hands-off FF2 and Cat 2 have no braking test at all. I don´t test applications~ only the physical attributes of equipment.",Nov 2009,Jul 21 2017,0
1706,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,14," ""I 'm not persuaded by the argument that there is really no problem because if you are thinking about the issue at all~ you have a bad anchor and should do something about that."" +1  Whether or not to clip the anchor has nothing to do with the quality of the anchor. It's a judgment call based upon the terrain and pitch at hand.  Further---I see this one all the time now...a party~ out of habit~ clips the anchor and off the leader goes....not realizing that the farther he gets away from the anchor~ the more forcefully the belayer will be pulled towards the clipped anchor--in some cases that could be upwards~ but I too often see people sitting away from the anchor or leaning back---not realizing in a high-force fall they will be pulled into the rock~ more than upwards---it's just asking to be smashed face first into the anchor/rock.  I won't even ask~ Jim or Rich~ about direct belaying....that would open an enormous can of worms! It's a cool technique~ though~ for certain circumstances....and on bolts~ perhaps the best option in the event of a factor2....(think: guiding Mental Physics in JTree with a 100-lb client)... Anyway~ thanks for the chat~ gents! RC  ",Sep 2009,Jul 21 2017,0
1707,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,15, I  think the quality of the anchor is an important consideration~ along with the terrain~ the proximity of the belayer to the anchor~ and the nature of the pitch to come~ in deciding whether or not to clip it. Well~ you didn't ask~ but I think a direct belay with a Munter hitch  on a pair of modern bolts seems to me to be about as good a belay as it is possible to have for single-rope climbing.  But with a gear anchor~ it seems to me that you'd want four pieces---two for upward loads and two for downward loads---and that isn't very practical much of the time.,Feb 2008,Jul 21 2017,1
1708,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,16," Yeah~ the way you put it is a more accurate statement----sure~ with a sub-optimal anchor~ you'd think twice about clipping it....but my initial discussion wasn't about the quality of the anchor (which should always be built ""up to task"")~ rather----the idea that clipping it creates problems as well as solves one.....this was my motivation for chiming it....that often one problem gets overprioritized (the holding power of a particular belay device)~ when the problem could be solved another way or another problem might be a consideration~ too--- Anyway....the direct belay thing~ I bet~ will be the source of some innovation/creativity in the years to come...we'll see. Have a super weekend and hope you get out to climb! RC",Sep 2009,Jul 21 2017,0
1709,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,17,"  What I was trying to say~ Rich~ and hope you can appreciate~ is that it goes beyond human ability to know precisely when the anchor can hold in some sort of dynamic and heroically perfect belay (and the anchor holds by the smallest of margins) as a means of survival for the party versus the far greater likelihood of simply dropping the leader (ie the deadly atc et al) in a FF2 event onto a solid anchor due to bad technique or poor choice of device. Recognizing that the anchor is less optimal and that the leader must not fall is **the only guarantee** available~ imo. I guess I come from this point from this side~ primarily~ and emphasize this as a fundamental to safe climbing~ particularly as 99.99% of climbers have zero experience doing an ideal dynamic belay in a FF2 scenario. I just don't think its going to save hardly anyone (ie perhaps some tiny fraction of climbers) in the real world versus being aware and simply not falling. Being totally aware of the situation is very different than trusting the anchor blindly and then proceeding to push one's limits right above the belay etc. If your anchor is less than ideal~ make it ideal or don't fall is the only advice I give. And bail if you think a fall is likely. Anything more I think is beyond the scope of internet prognostication ie the party in this situation better be advanced and cognizant of the situation and have learned this sort of esoteria from their mentors in the real world rather than simply reading about it. I tailor my comments to beginners in a sense in this regard~ sparing them the rare situation and focusing them on the common. However~ having the belayer as far below as possible is a very sound idea~ though I will share as an ideal solution in an emergency. That's the most likely to be effective form of ""dynamic belay"" that can reliably be done~ imo.",Aug 2012,Jul 21 2017,0
1710,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,18, In climbing we usually talk fall protection rather than fall prevention~ but the fact is that fall prevention is going hurt a lot less and less frequently than fall protection. Obviously shit happens~ but really your best protection from injury is holding on with your two hands and feet.  On a side note~ you might be amazed by what strength you can harness when you really don't want to fall. ,May 2014,Jul 21 2017,1
1711,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,4,19, I only read a couple pages of this thread but haven't seen this mentioned yet; as someone who owns a megajul and has used it several days in single and multi-pitch terrain~ I would not recommend buying one. The device tends to twists the rope(s) more than a guide ATC. As mentioned repeatedly~ it's not in the same class as a gri-gri so it's hard to really compare. If you're looking for something comparable to a gri-gri maybe try an Alpine-up Agreed that it twists the ropes.  That said~ it's so light~ so good at assisted braking~ and so easy to feed slack~ I continue to use it anyway (but only for big alpine routes where I like being able to take my hands off for a second~ and where weight is paramount).  ,Mar 2013,Sep 27 2017,1

Beal  Tiger). With MegaJul Normally  we must act to abseil down~ like a Gri-Gri.Abseiling down I stopped on a ledge to untangle the rope. For a moment no tension was at the device and the rope crossed at the Megajul hole...and I didn´t realize that...  as I put in pictures attached here ~result: if the rope is crossed no longer blocks the device!!! it is easier to happen with thin ropes even meeting the specifications of ropes accepted by the device from 7.8 to 10.5 M.

1716,Edelrid MegaJul Belay Device,5,4, The more you get into the technicalities of the MegaJul and similar devices the more warning flags pop up.  These devices can be great but their limitations are basically unknown by the general public.  That is a problem.  Jim Titt has highlighted many already~ lots of them occur are small probability events~ but it is precisely these small probability event that you want a device that behaves reliably and predictably. Anyway there was a near miss recently down in Tasmania that involved severe rope burns and a MegaJul....  (The epic had a serious of cascading errors but the climbers kept themselves safe and the PBL trigger was an accident while it was in somebodies pocket.) Jim Titt's comment above should be remembered well for anybody wanting to use the MegaJul or a similar assisted locking device with thinner ropes.  Sure the Megajul is only rated for 7.9mm but it isn't unreasonable that people might unknowingly use small diameter ropes.,Jul 2012,Jan 5 2020,0

I have climbed and own several pairs of the LS Maverinks and if your climbing shoe size is 42 or under you most likely will be able to fit into a pair. Only caveat is the Maverinks stretch about a full size so size and fit accordingly. Good luck in your search! Just to add a little more info. I’m 41.5 in LS Futura and 40.5 in the Maverinks. I’m on my 3rd pair of Maverinks that I primarily use for gym climbing. It’s a really simple slipper with not a lot of down turn and it is highly sensitive. It also resoles really well because of the no edge. Hope that helps!,Sep 2012,Jan 7 2020,0

1763,Wide foot alert - Tenaya Mastia gets two flippers up,1,0," Hi~ I'm Troy McClure. You may remember from such shoe reviews as ""holy schnikes~ the Butora Mantra fits me""~ ""the Mythos stretched really nicely to conform to my flippers""~ and ""aw fuck~ I can't even stand up while wearing these"". Today I'm here to share that Tenaya is expanding into the business of flipper fitting. Unlike all previous Tenaya shoe models~ I was able to get a usable pair of Mastias on my feet without three metric shittons of empty space left over in the toebox. For an 11.5 4E foot~ the rep started me at street size~ and then we dropped it down a half-size in Murican. By the time he was wrapping up his shift~ I was considering dropping it another half-size~ so along with the Butora Endeavour*~ this makes two new-to-me models I've found this year. The rep noted that they use a rubber formulation that is on the softer side~ so these are recommended as more as a svelte sendsation rather than a workhorse. I found them slightly less sticky than the Endeavour~ but overall I endorse and will consider adding to the quiver after I'm done with the wallet shenanigans I've already planned. * I tried them on a lark at the Spot Denver's grand opening and bought them like~ within 10 minutes.

I'm also 11.5~ but average to slight narrow and pretty low volume feet. I don't own the Mastias~ but was able to get a really great fit out of them~ despite the single point of adjustment.

(EDIT: somewhere toward the end of P. 2 I added a ""Summarizing the summary of the summary"" which people may find useful.) Look up the reviews and the Camp Photon Wire~ 30g~ is supposed to handle by far the best of any of the UL biners~ even with gloves on.  There is a thread on that here~ but it's like 5 years old. So~ let me ask for a different take and more modern (post-discontinuation of the BD oz) discussion: On the Photon Wire discussion~ not one person commented on THE issue for me - does the nose snag on runners? I'm a trad climber~ and all too often I have been in a sketchy stance trying to get a placement~ when I clip the sling...oops but the nose catches.  Well~ I'll just try aga... another snag. OK~ I'll just pull this out and... arghghghg the biner pulled the sling out of position and my feet are about to blow out and arghghghghggh... you get the picture. At one point I started to buy the lovely petzl ""keyway"" design biners~ but those are HEAVY - currently on the petzl site at 39 g. The Petzl Ange L is a full-size biner that is 34 g - not bad - but came in waaaay behind in the reviews in outdoorgearlabs.com review.  Both it and the Wild country Helium 2 are nearly 2X the price of the Camp Photon Wire as well. I have a pair of old~ at the time very very fancy~ ultra-light dmm biners that are the king of heinous snagging.  Pictures of the photon wire nose~ which looks like a fish hook~ also looks exactly like the old DMMs~ and that terrifies me. In the Photon wire discussion several people pointed out that they had poor quality control~ holes looked in the wrong places~ some gates were so soft they were returned or refused~ and someone said they were made in china - off my list for human rights reasons. So are you a trad climber and if so~ how would you rate the ""snagosity"" of the Camp Photon Wire?  It would be a service to the community here to compare ""snagaceousness"" to the best-known biners.  E.g.: ""yes I'm a strictly  trad climber~ and it snags never/rarely/noticeable amount/frequently out of hundreds of uses"".   Elseways~ what is your trad favorite lightweight biner and why? Thanks~ -TPC",Aug 2015,Dec 2 2019,2
1773,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,1, I never have trouble with my Photons.  I also like the Mammut Wall Light carabiners. They're about the same weight and size as the CAMP Nanos but handle better~ IMO. ,Jan 2016,Dec 2 2019,1
1774,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,2, This was discussed in a recent thread but I couldn't find it. EDIT linked Photons have the problems you mentioned and I've looked down to see them nose snagged before.  + i've had to retire a bunch from the springs wearing out on the gate. Dyons all the way.

1780,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,8, This has been discussed extensively and it always seems that most people prefer either the Wild Country Helium or CAMP Dyon.  I use dyon's for alpine draws and love them~ but the helium is great too~ I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed with either. Although the dyon is basically just a snag-free photon~ the gate feel is completely different and I much prefer it to the photon. It also seems to me that the quality is overall higher on the dyon's than the few photon's I have. Regarding CAMP quality control~ I've been using dyons since they came out and have had no issues with any of them~ they all still feel great.  For whatever reason my photon's seem to be aging less gracefully~ despite having either similar or less mileage on them than my dyons.,Oct 2017,Dec 2 2019,0
1781,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,9, Snag free biners are going to be more expensive~ no way around it. Photons will not do the trick. Go for the dyons.,Oct 2017,Dec 2 2019,0

1787,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,15, Pirate~ agree with you on the china aspect and I should really put my money where my mouth is... but I've yet to find a better biner than the Dyon and~ at $7.50 each~ that adds up when we're talking a few dozen of them. Very easy to score them on sale for anywhere from 7-8 bucks~ and I don't even like heliums as much~ let alone for 10 bucks (don't seem to find them at as good of sale prices as dyons),Aug 2017,Dec 2 2019,0
1788,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,16, Perhaps it is a small benefit~ but the wiregates that are snag-free and enclose the gate in a hood have the added benefit of reducing the chance of the gate opening when scraped against the rock.  It seems to me that the Dyon is actually more likely to have this happen than many other biners. With the Alpha Light and OZ apparently being discontinued~ that leaves the Chimera and Helium as two excellent choices (but unfortunately pricey).  I like the lighter Chimera for racking cams~ and the larger Helium for general purpose use. I've also used the Ange S~ which has the smoothest clipping nose~ but do not particularly like pinching the single wire when holding the spine.,Jul 2010,Dec 3 2019,1
1789,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,1,17, Smaller options are the WC Helium and DMM Chimera~ both have a nose that protects the wire gate.  Larger option with great clip ability with gloves is the DMM Alpha Trad.,Nov 2006,Dec 3 2019,0

1796,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,2,3," Summarizing the summary of the summary Thanks again people for all your varied contributions.  I have really learned a LOT - much more than from manufacturer's info. Thanks to folks above for setting me straight on some points. My summary is that the four biners below are excellent~ fairly lightweight~ each has their own place I suppose.  I did not find many reviews of the Chimera~ but people go nuts over them and do not complain they are hard to clip... but they have a substantially smaller gate opening~ possibly the widest nose here~ but they are 10% lighter~ . Biner                | weight | gate Wd | lowprice | Comments   (reference for made in) Helium II           33g        27mm      $10.88     Great reviews~ many fans~ big nose hard to clip some bolts~ chains~ not that light~ comments about being easy to handle in gloves; made in Taiwan (mec.ca) Camp Dyon      33 g       26 mm      $10.46    many fans~ not loved for quality~ not in best-known reviews~ made in china (sierra.com) DMM Chimera 30g        21 mm      $11.21    snag-free~ but nose is possibly even wider than HeII~ made in Whales (mfgr video etc.) Petzl Ange L    34 g       26 mm      $9.32       many people hate the single wire~ supposedly there is a right way to clip which fixes this; one review claimed nose ices up; made in france (mtntools.com) gate Wd = gate width lowprice = lowest price via google search Comments and Made in....people say all kindsa stuff about where something is manufactured~ so I tried to give a reference (in parenthesis). Could we say the ultimate combo would be to have HeII on the rope side~ Chimera on the cam?   Others Noted ---------------------- DMM Alpha Trad 35 g 25 mm opening looks like standard wire hook nose but has the same description as Chimera nose~ ""clean nose"". opening standard wire hook nose.  It's a bit heavier than the rest. Mammut wall light - 23 g~ has standard wire hook nose. About Snagging -------------------------- Most carabiners these days have a really nice~ really smooth finish~ and rounded edges.  Snagging occurs primarily when the nose hook encounters the thin edge of your runner. So~ with a hood~ the hook is still there to hook things~ but since you can't get the thin edge of the runner into the crook of the hook~ you could probably never snag it. Modern biners save weight using wire to remove the gate and save weight~ voila~ all of the ones above are hooded wired~ except for Ange~ which is a single wire and different.  Other Comments: ------------------------------- I disqualified any tiny or mini-biners - if we're paying double to avoid a snag~ what would be the point of including a biner so small you complained it was hard to clip ropes?  DMM Marketing take note:  I had to work sooooo hard~ and have soooo many people jump on me before I found a picture that showed that the Chimera has a ""hooded"" design~ and is probably snag-free. Good pictures are important~ folks! There is a review that shows all these biners together~ and the chimera looks like it has the largest nose... but it's unclear whether it's compared to a Helium I or II. https://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2017/09/13/comparison-review-lightweight-snag-free-carabiners/ COMPARISON: Petzl spirit I think was one of the first non-snaging biners~ solid gate and keyway - 39g $8.54~ not so fancy but works great.  They are my favorite biner in my current collection before I got all these comments and will go shopping (among a collection of truly awesomely  old~ heavy (one is 65 g!!!!)~ random and sometimes nasty biners).",Aug 2015,Dec 3 2019,10000

1803,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,2,10, Just to note: the Chimera IS a mini biner~ just not a micro biner. They are quite nice~ but just a little too small for me.    I have been experimenting with many different biners to see which I like best. I have settled on the CAMP Dyon for clipping pro~ the nose design is just SOOO thin~ you can fish the loop of a nut/cam out of a crack much easier than any other biner.  I do not like the mushy action on Helium~ or the wide nose on the Alpha~ though they seem to be very popular. ,Jul 2015,Dec 5 2019,10000

1805,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,2,12," As far as I can tell a relatively ""light"" and ""snag free"" biner don't really go together right now.  Calling a 30+g carabiner light in 2019 is miss categorizing it considering there are 19g biners on the market and a few in the low 20's.  A 19g is light~ a 30g biner is average and 40g is heavy (Standard Petzl Spirit)",Jun 2014,Dec 5 2019,10000
1806,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,2,13,  That's the same reason I use Nanos. Put differently~ 466 grams is the same weight as a full set of BD ULs from .4 to #2. ,Jan 2016,Dec 5 2019,10000
1807,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,2,14, The micro/mini carabiner sub-category: Nano~ 19g~ Metolius Mini~ Ange S  etc~ are too hard for my old arthritic~ beat up sausage fingers to clip and/or manipulate. That is why I personally went away from them.  I don't climb at an elite level for trad~ so I don't need to shave off that last little ounce. Even if I did~ it would be easier to just lose a couple of pounds off my gut than have to deal with those tiny biners. Seriously~ a good shit offsets all of your weight savings for micro biners.  But some people obviously like them.  ,Jul 2015,Dec 5 2019,10000

1809,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,2,16, as much as I want to save weight~ I'm currently upgrading (or is that downgrading?) the remaining OZ racking biners I have~ to DMM Chimera. Currently have a mix of WC Helium~ DMM Alpha Trad~ OZ~ and a couple Astros - whenever I clip directly to a cam with an OZ or even just take it off my harness~ I hate the gate feel. Annoying to clip too. The WC/DMM biners just feel so much better to use. I'm mainly justifying the weight increase (28 to 30g ea) by looking at the kn ratings - 20/7/7 UIAA minimum for BD~ vs 23/7/9 for Chimera~ and even higher for Helium/Alpha Trad Also the rope bearing radius is larger for the non-mini biners. Less drag~ less wear. When I'm leading trad at my limit~ the approach shoes and water go on the follower - makes way more difference than 7oz of 'biner savings. I hate fumbling to clip when pumped. As much as I want to go with 19/22g biners~ I know I'd end up hating myself after and end up selling them.,Oct 2010,Dec 5 2019,10000

About 2-3g lighter than the Trad/Helium~ slightly smaller - closer in size to an OZ I wish the Chimera/Alpha Light was a 28g biner - would make it a for sure option vs the Trad/Helium. The weight savings can add up~ but the Trad/Heliums are nicer for rope clipping~ for me.,Oct 2010,Dec 10 2019,0
1836,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,4,3, I did an experiment a while back after re-tooling with Mini biners (19g~ Nano)~ and finding that I hated them and wanted a bigger biner.  So I bought 6 Trango Phase~ 6 Chimera~ 6 Phantom and 12 Ange S (good deal). Paired with the Mammut Contact sling for an alpine draw.,Jul 2015,Dec 10 2019,2
1837,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,4,4, I honestly don't find 19g biners hard to handle at all.  I've spent a fair bit of time technical alpine climbing in gloves with them and manage to clip/unclip them just fine.   I kinda prefer a sparse and light rack not just a sparse one.  Best of both worlds.  I think small biners have gotten a bad rap from the metolius mini biners which were the first truly small biner to the market.  Those things are absolutely awful to use!  Gate opening was too small~ the lip of the basket was too high and the spine had zero reverse curve which produced a poor handling experience.  And they aren't even that light. I can't agree more about those blasted Metolius mini biners. I have a friend who set his entire rack up with them. Such a hateful carabiner. Nothing against Metolius~ they make great stuff~ but those things are God-awful. ,Jun 2010,Dec 12 2019,0
1838,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,4,5, Great conversation I'm learning a lot. I have @40-45 Heliums that don't get used any more. I did what Mikey did and dropped down to those Edelrid 19g (and the 22ounce Camps too) biners for similar but differing reasons. Coming back from a knee problem that's been screwing with me for a couple of years (Buck~ yer knees are next on the arthritis hate list buddy) I want light and have been climbing easier longer types of routes (trad). They're not as nice as the Heliums~ not even close~ but hey~ 19g. Next on the list is to drop the weight I put on~ but until then it's nice to take it off the rack. I have a newer climbing partner now who wants to bring his rack~ as we have similar racks except for the biners~ I'm just now wondering if he hates on the 19g biners. Anyway~ they suck and are fantastic simultaneously~  you might hate on them so try before you buy. They're better than the little Metolius ones~ but still tiny and can be difficult to clip. BTW~ Mikey~ as you climb a lot more than me you most likely already know this~ but Grivel makes a 37gram locker! They get that weight by being small and they suck in some circumstances as they're so tiny~ but for clipping off a pair of shoes or a water bottle to yer harness that you don't want unclipping on a long route...37GRAMS IS SWEET!

1839,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,4,6, What I am doing now on some trad draws is have a compact biner for clipping gear~ and a larger~ yet still light-ish biner to clip the rope to.  Some people are OCD and need the same stuff~ but I am more franken-gear at this point.,Jul 2015,Dec 15 2019,1
1840,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,4,7, The Grivel plume is great for a locker. On multipitch my only regular sized locker is the belay locker and the rest are plumes. They work great and hold a clove just fine~ especially paired with a Mammut serenity. ,Mar 2014,Dec 15 2019,1
1841,Best snag-free very light trad carabiner,4,8, What I am doing now on some trad draws is have a compact biner for clipping gear~ and a larger~ yet still light-ish biner to clip the rope to.  Some people are OCD and need the same stuff~ but I am more franken-gear at this point. Most of my alpines are camp Nano on one end and Camp Photon on the rope end. So you're not alone. ,Jan 2016,Dec 15 2019,1

1845,Beal Birdie,1,0, Has anybody regularly used the beal birdie? What reviews do you give it? How does it compare to the grigri?  Thanks in advance,May 2019,Oct 23 2019,1
1846,Beal Birdie,1,1, I talked to a couple climbers~ they liked it more than GriGri. mproj thread - ​https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/117695178/beal-birdie​​​,Feb 2012,Oct 23 2019,0
1847,Beal Birdie,1,2, I have been using the birdie and I really like it. It’s smooth~ light and straightforward. I have zero complaints!,Dec 2007,Nov 7 2019,0
1848,Beal Birdie,1,3, Do you think it feeds better than the Gri Gri when not holding the cam down? As in tube style feed?,Mar 2019,Nov 8 2019,0
1849,Beal Birdie,1,4, Do you think it feeds better than the Gri Gri when not holding the cam down? As in tube style feed? I've been using one for  few months and it does feed better than a GriGri when not holding the cam down~ but it's still not quite good enough to not hold the cam down when belaying a leader making quick clips.,Mar 2007,Nov 8 2019,1
1850,Beal Birdie,1,5, Generally I like it better and feeds better for me without holding can down. I'm sure this depends upon what rope size/model it is paired with. Lowering is super smooth. I like that the handle is all metal. Plastic handles give me the creeps.,Dec 2012,Dec 8 2019,0
1851,Beal Birdie,1,6, Yes~ I personally have been using the Birdie for a while now. I own a gri-gri and a birdie~ both are real good for different reasons. The main difference is weight~  the birdie is heavy~ its a hunk of metal. However giving slack is amazing~ there is no awkward motion for giving slack. Lowering can be weird but after a while you get use to it. ,Apr 2019,Dec 9 2019,0
1852,Beal Birdie,1,7, try the Mad Rock Lifeguard~ it's lighter than a grigri 2 (by a little bit)~ more compact~ economical~ and feeds well like a tube style  device when belaying.  No need to hold down the cam when feeding rope.,Feb 2009,Dec 9 2019,1
1853,Beal Birdie,1,8, I've found the birdie to be a little picky with certain ropes. Some ropes stick in the device and require override of the cam when paying out slack. Its also heavier than the grigri~ but I use my birdie in the gym where wight doesn't matter. However~ its cheaper than the grigri. ,Sep 2013,Dec 9 2019,0
1854,Beal Birdie,1,9, The weight of the Birdy is just over an ounce heavier which to me is insignificant.,Dec 2012,Dec 9 2019,0
1855,Beal Birdie,1,10," i sold my grigri and got a birdie. i've been using it in the gym the last few weeks with a bd 9.9 gym rope and mammut 9.8 infinity. i wouldn't say it's good enough to really feed quickly without holding down the cam unless you want to move a lot on your feet to help with slack. the problem is there isn't a lip to hold~ so i pinch the bottom by the carabiner hole and the cam which causes the rope to run right by my finger and burn it a little on occasion... i also think the lever provides less torque~ i feel like i have to crank pretty hard to get a decently fast lower. and finally~ one point Beal made was the rope would run without a bend straight over the device but the geometry doesn't really force it to do this at all. would i recommend it to a friend? yes. is it a grigri killer? no. is it worth saving the $30+(!!) for a grigri? probably yeah. the grigri isn't more ""premium""",Sep 2016,Dec 9 2019,2
1856,Beal Birdie,1,11, +1 to everything Chris said.  If you're picky it might not be for you.  But if you don't drop it~ you'll probably be handing it down to your grandkids because that thing isn't going to wear out anytime soon~ it seems.,Nov 2015,Dec 9 2019,0
1857,Beal Birdie,1,12, Alright so I had the birdie for a while and ended up returning it and here's why: -I knew that it would weigh more than a grigri~ but I didn't realize until I had one in each hand how much more it weighs. If you trad and you're trying to keep your rack light~ I do not recommend -the second reason~ the reason why I returned it~ is that there isn't a safe way to quickly give out slack like with a grigri. There's no thumb catch so if you need to hold the camming device down you have to do exactly what the Petzl (I know they didn't make it~ don't come for me) website says not to do which is hold the entire device in one hand and essentially let go of the brake rope. This is so so so soooo dangerous. I have climbing partners that like to clip lower and I need to give out a lot of slack at once. I do not feel safe using this device for that reason exactly.  I think that it is worth mentioning that it does feed the rope smoother than the grigri~ but I don' think that this is reason enough to buy it. I would not recommend. If anyone asks~ I'd tell them to just buy a grigri.,Dec 2018,Dec 16 2019,0
1858,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,0, I'm fortunate to have the ability to test many types of climbing gear~ and I recently tried both the Mammut Smart 2.0 (as well as the original) with and without the Smarter attachment~ and the Black Diamond ATC Pilot.Mammut Smart 2.0,Dec 2012,Jun 16 2018,9
1859,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,1, The old smart shape was inferior to the new one~ and it didn't feed as smoothly as the 2.0~ bit I still agree it's nicer than the pilot,Dec 2012,Jun 16 2018,2
1860,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,2, Having tried out both~ I definitely feel that the pilot feeds more smoothly than the smart 2.0- but the rope does slip through when weighted for the pilot.,Mar 2015,Jun 17 2018,2
1861,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,3, Nice review~ it convinced me not to waste my money on the Pilot.  I use the auto bloc/lock devices to climb trees~ and prefer the type doesn't slip.  The Lifeguard works with the least amount of down rope of ones I have. I recently got the Smart 2.0 package and the carabiner that comes with it has the largest diameter of any carabiners that I have~ even industrial type steel ones.  One of the close ones is the original Petzl Attaché.,Jun 2016,Jul 25 2018,1
1862,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,4, If you're not getting smooth lowering with the Pilot~ I suspect you're doing it wrong. Don't lift up on the thumb hook. Push forward on the back of the device to rotate it.,Jul 2015,Jul 25 2018,5
1863,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,5, I am holding out until there is a Smart Alpine 2.0,Apr 2014,Aug 30 2018,9
1864,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,6, So am I. 2020 is what the rep claimed. ,Dec 2012,Aug 30 2018,5
1865,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,7, Another thing I noticed using the Pilot is that it gets HOT really quickly when lowering. ,Jan 2016,Aug 30 2018,0
1866,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,8, For what it's worth~ I got to climb in the Gunks with some AMGA Rock Instructors and Rock Guides~ and they now prefer the ATC Pilot as the belay device of choice to give to clients that they've just taught to belay~ especially when they're going to be lead belaying said guides.,Mar 2015,Sep 4 2018,1
1867,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,9, It's very likely their choice is based on BD aggressively promoting and discounting the Pilot for use by AMGA guides.,Oct 2010,Sep 6 2018,6
1868,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,10, The Smart 2.0 and Pilot are almost the same~ IMO~ in function. I can also see why guides would want one of them in use by an unknown and inexperienced belayer. ,Jan 2016,Sep 6 2018,0
1869,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,11, I certainly agree with that. I had a hold break shortly after I left the ground and placed my first piece~ fell and hit the end of the rope. I looked down and my belayers hand was not on the rope. Thankfully she had a smart~ because i would have broken a leg given the terrain and height. ,Dec 2012,Sep 7 2018,3
1870,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,12, It's very likely their choice is based on BD aggressively promoting and discounting the Pilot for use by AMGA guides. I'll ask if they wouldn't mind me sharing their name~ but for what it's worth~ they got to try out each of the current devices on the market~ and the pilot was the one they chose.,Mar 2015,Sep 7 2018,1
1871,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,13, Ive only used the original smart and pilot but i wanted to point out that the lowering method is completely different~ so if you are used to using a pilot~ the smart will feel weird and vice versa. On a smart~ you lower by pushing out(or up) on the nose. On the pilot~ there's not much of a nose becaues you're supposed to grab both sides of the device and tilt it. If you do it this way~ the lowering is super smooth.  Having used the original smart and the pilot the pilot is wayyyy smoother and more controlled for lowering~ and feeds smoother as well. but I havent tried the smart 2.0 . yet. ,Feb 2012,Nov 23 2018,2
1872,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,14, The Smart is much more like a Megajul in how you use it~ as Danger noted. I find the Pilot to feed better and to be much more ergonomically friendly specifically because you are gripping and rotating the device vs pushing outward on a nose/wire loop. But in the end~ the important part is that you know how to use the device you choose well (I forget if it's Jim Titt~ rgold~ or healyje that has made really good points about knowing your device's failure modes~ and that all devices have one or more failure modes).,May 2016,Nov 24 2018,0
1873,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,15, I'm thinking about upgrading to the smart 2.0 from the original and found this thread. One benefit I see for the smart over the pilot is that you can lower (or rap a single line) with both hands on the brake side of the rope. ,Mar 2006,Dec 7 2019,1
1874,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,16, Well there ya go.... My use of the devices in question yields results that are the exact opposite of the OP. BD better in all uses. I chock it up to subjective assessment~ technique~ and the rope size/model.,Dec 2012,Dec 8 2019,1
1875,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,17, The Smart 2.0 is my favorite lead belay device.  Feeds slack smooth as silk and locks down quick and firm when you need it. I wish you could double rope rap with it.  Wondering if you could safely rap with two of them side to side on the appropriate caribiner.  No matter~ the smart is light enough to carry along with a guide atc for belaying the follower off the anchor and rapping. ,May 2018,Dec 8 2019,0
1876,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,18, You need the Smart Alpine~ which apparently has a new version (2.0) coming out.,Dec 2012,Dec 8 2019,0
1877,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,19, Two of Mammut’s 6mm Rap lines can fit into the Smart 2.0~ probably the original also.,Jun 2016,Dec 9 2019,0
1878,Mammut Smart 2.0 vs BD ATC Pilot,1,20, You need the Smart Alpine~ which apparently has a new version (2.0) coming out. You know they still make the original Smart Alpine~ right~ no need to wait.  I have used the Smart for single ropes and the Alpine when doing multipitch or rappelling for a while now.  It may be because I am used to it~ but I like the original better than the newer version.  I find the hook release better than the tab on the 2.0. I like the Pilot~ it works just fine~ but the body does get hot when lowering.,Jun 2014,Dec 16 2019,0
1879,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,1,0, Hi everyone~ I would like to bring to your attention an issue with faulty cables on Moses Tomahawk Pitons that just caused a 40-foot leader fall on our ascent of the Muir Wall on El Cap (07/01 – 07/08). Meanwhile~ a note has been posted on the Moses website (https://mosesclimbing.us/product-safety-advisory/) stating that all Tomahawks from 2019 through June may be affected – unfortunately too late for us!! In a nutshell~ I was leading pitch 29 (C4 crux) and placed 2 large Tomahawks in a row. While bounce-testing the upper one~ I fell approximately 40 feet onto the portaledge we had set up at the anchor below. While dangling off the deformed portaledge and gathering myself~ I realized that 2 micro nuts and an offset cam I had placed below the pitons had blown and were clipped to the climbing rope~ however~ the 2 Tomahawks I had placed last~ and which should still have been attached to my aiders~ were missing!  While leading the pitch the second time~ I saw that both pitons were actually still in the crack~ and the cable had pulled through the swage ferrule on both pieces (see photos)! I don’t understand why such a flaw in the manufacturing process has gone unnoticed for 6 months and I really think the climbing community has to be made aware of this issue beyond the brief note on the company’s website. I'm not sure if Moses started a large-scale recall~ but thus far I haven't gotten any email from the retailer I purchased the pitons from! Therefore~ PLEASE SHARE this information~ so that further accidents can be prevented! These cables can pull under body weight!!!,Oct 2015,Jul 10 2019,48

1887,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,1,8, Hey sorry for your fall Yuki. Glad you're ok!...and huge congrats for getting back up there~ for sure. Muir is an amazing route! So so so good! Theron Moses is a stellar man~ and I'm sure any brevity in his responses here or to you personally is only because of limited free time (he is a family man who makes our climbing gear after hours at his machine shop job). I'm really hoping to ramp up my rental offerings for bigwall stuff (maybe offer some low cost subscription where you could borrow all the gear~ bags~ ledges for $100/year?)~ so taking care of~ and dialing out~ these speciality pieces will be easier. For the last several years I've recommended just cutting off the cable that comes with the beak and putting on a high strength 5.5 cord. See pic:,Dec 2013,Jul 10 2019,9

Worse~ the wires typically start to come apart a few at a time~ causing many pokey little things that irritate you while you're climbing (they don't just wear out~ or break~ they just break a few little wires at a time~ so they still look good but have pokey spikes sticking out and are compromised~ strength-wise)......just taking the cables off all the beaks~ because they don't work~ seems like an easy common sense solution.,Dec 2013,Jul 11 2019,2
1905,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,5, Russ doesn’t make beaks.  Moses are the best thing going save for the recent hiccup. ,Apr 2012,Jul 11 2019,6
1906,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,6, Dude if you used them before those cables where compromised by you~ I always back up sling my beaks and I carry boat loads of webbing and cord to re sling with because I’ve had swagges blow. Welcome to the world of aid climbing~ ya gotta improvise and back up your gear. We all sling up our bd beaks because we know they are thin~ Moses cables are better but just one hammer hit can compromise so its on you for whipping and not being caught~ no one else,Mar 2016,Jul 12 2019,4
1907,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,7, Honestly if your blaming Moses has stoped him from doing the public service he does~ that’s on you~ we all accept the risks of what we do~ we think for our self and back our cables up because that’s what we do. If your complaining about taking a whip on an A2 pitch just go sport climbing in boulder canyon. We all do dangerous stuff~ yer gunna diiii~ it’s not on Moses to be responsible for our lives~ thats on us~ he just welds the tools that we use to make our own decisions,Mar 2016,Jul 12 2019,2
1908,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,8, That makes no sense at all. When I buy a piece of pro~ I pay the manufacturer to sell me a product I can rely on. I shouldn‘t have to question every pieces strenght. If the cable is kinked or partially destroyed~ it is on me to repair it. It‘s not a climbers job to question a relatively new product if it still looks good.,Apr 2019,Jul 12 2019,10
1909,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,9, I wonder if Theron wants you speaking for him? I’d doubt he’d want this message directed at a customer who just stared down two consecutive coffin nails that came out of his shop and yet has seemingly forgave him.

1910,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,10, Nuts are swaged too... but~ the larger the company the LESS likely there will be a failure.  But with that being said~ this should NEVER happen.  It just CANT happen.... but it did~ meaning Moses was not doing ALL THEY COULD to insure the quality of the swages on their gear.  That is troubling at best~ and negligent at worst.

1913,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,13, So now I have a question. How strong are the pins themselves? I hadn't even realized they were considered body weight only placement until I read the safety advisory. I've heard of them catching falls and being placed as pro on free climbs. Is this just the same as placing an RP? I assumed they looked pretty damn strong~ am I wrong?,Aug 2017,Jul 12 2019,0

1916,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,16, Hayden! Believe me or not but I've had plenty of time to reflect on the risks I take in the past 13 years I've been climbing and mountaineering~ and I've had several falls and accidents that were much more serious that this one~ resulting in real injuries (so no need to educate me dude!). Am I responsible for what I do? YES! Am I responsible to check my gear for wear and tare? YES! Am I responsible for a fall caused by a manufacturing error? NO (period!) We all have to rely on gear that we buy! What would you say if your brand-new harness with no signs of damage came apart all of a sudden???,Oct 2015,Jul 12 2019,15
1917,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,17," Hi Russ and Dante~ Thanks for your professional insights! I probably will never trust a swaged cable again~ haha! I was wondering if the cables that come with nuts are swaged too~ or if that is some other kind of connection (e.g.~ soldered)? Yup~ typically wired nuts are swaged (not small brass HB's/DMM Imps etc wireds which are soldered). The thing is~ places like Black Diamond and DMM have mfg and testing tools and protocols in place to test product before it goes out the door. You can get that with scale as they crank out a lot of product. BD/Chouinard use to test all things to 1/2 of their ultimate strength before they shipped.  We got into doing cable assemblies for a worldwide Mfg. The assemblies were eye to eye 12"" long 1/16 PVC with SS wire which were used on cabinet doors to keep them from opening all the way. Started out making a couple hundred~ next thing we knew we were getting orders for thousands. Ours were testing out to 195ft lbs approx~ which was overkill for that application. Not so much if you weight 200lbs and are standing on it half way up El Cap.  At approx 10~000 1/16"" sized swedges~ the Nicopress jaws would start to break via hairline cracks. I'm putting this up there for Theron to eyeball. Cagey old fucks like Russ at Fish or John Yates most likely figured this out when I was still pre-sperm/egg so this is for those who don't know it.  Eventually~ we did a Pneumatic press with hardened steel tooling which was faster and longer lasting. Might have lasted forever if the business hadn't gone to China. We still do a few hundred larger cables (1/8"" x 3') every 6 months and the manual Nicos work fine for that as it's not worth tooling up for the Pneumatic press.",Mar 2006,Jul 15 2019,9
1918,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,2,18, Hey Theron~ Many thanks for the great responses to the cable issue. Sounds like you’re dealing well with it. Back in my Trango days we had 3-4 recalls and I found that the best way to deal with it was to get out in front of it as soon possible. In each case~ I personally got on the horn and call every dealer who we had shipped the suspect product to~ followed up with a brodcast fax (remember those?) to all dealers~ regardless of whether they’d bought the suspect product or not. The next day I’d call every climber friend I knew who was likely to have purchased or been given the product and ask them to return it. If it was a product we’d shipped to REI they’d make us file a report with a CPSC within a few days. Funny thing with the CPSC was that when we’d hear back from them~ usually 2-3 years after our recall was over and all the suspect products had been inspected~ replaced or destroyed~ their response was always that our defective product didn’t create a significant danger to public safety and we didn’t have to do a recall. We’d always get a laugh out of that. I wish I’d saved and framed those letters. Whatever~ let me know if I can help I any way~ Mal,Jan 2001,Jul 15 2019,19

1922,Moses Tomahawk pitons with faulty cables!,3,2, Bummer about Yuki's fall and the Moses swaging issue. It would probably be a good idea for a manufacturer to have a test program for any life safety climbing gear. Testing swages on a regular schedule wouldn't be hard to do.

1930,Nemo Chogori 3 Tent Strength?,1,7, I can not say enough good things about the  tent! I took it too Aconcagua last winter (summer down in South America). I was originally planning on using it as a base camp tent and brining a second lighter tent for high camp. But we went over our weight limit so only brought the Chogori. It did fantastic and it’s light enough that carrying it up was not a big deal. We had some very windy days on Aconcagua and it held up great. I added guy lines of course but as long as it is guy’d out securely we had no problems. We had one night when we came down from high camp and didn’t guy out the tent. Once the winds picked up we had to secure the tent but once guy’d out zero problems. The inside is HUGE! We had two people in it plus all of our gear and still had space. You could easily fit three people fairly comfortably and fit four if the conditions required in a pinch.  I’m a big fan of exoskeleton tents I think the set up it’s just way better. I also have a Hilleberg with the exoskeleton set up. My one complaint is in the winds it’s a bit noisy but what are you gonna do that’s a fairly small complaint. Plans to use on Denali as well,Nov 2017,Nov 8 2019,2

1934,Nemo Chogori 3 Tent Strength?,1,11, we used ours on denali this year and a couple wild winter outings in glacier and other montana spots last year. great space and held up to some tough nights. really comfortable for 2 to hang gear/not suffocate and we even 4 upped it (3 of us over 6ft) one night at 17k~ which was absurdly warm but manageable size wise. easy to set up~ and free standing - which was a requirement for us.  at 6' and 6'4~ it's pretty nice to have the headspace over a significant period of time. weight seemed comparable to other true 4 season outfits.,Aug 2016,Dec 12 2019,1
1935,2020 black diamond HotForge Screwgate,1,0, Got one of these Saturday at REI. Seems like a nice medium sized locker. Used it cleaning sport routes. The screw gate has a nice feel to it. Easy to spin but gradually slows as you get to fully open or fully closed. Liked the action better than the metolius element and bravo. The screw felt better than my petzl Screwgate as well.

1947,2020 black diamond HotForge Screwgate,1,12, Several vocal experienced climbers are totally against the use of a PAS to the point that some will not even climb with you if you use a PAS.  Other very experienced climbers like and use them. The complaints against the PAS boil down to: A PAS is unnecessary because you can use draws (alpine draws in multipitch environment) or the rope to accomplish the task.   A PAS adds to the cluster of gear on your harness and belay loop. Many PAS~ but not all PAS~ are made from static material (dyneema) so a slip onto the achor can have catastrophic results~ especially if you have climbed above the anchor. Personally~ I find a PAS useful and use one.  I use the Petzl Connect which is made with a dynamic rope that can handle 5 fall factor 2 falls onto the anchor keeping the load in the safe range.  (not any worse than falling on the rope onto the the anchor).  Although I understand the complaints against the PAS~ I find the hate of PAS~ especially PAS made of dynamic material~ unjustified.

1955,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,0, Clean-nose Carabiners: CAMP Dyon Carabiners are the cornerstone to every climber’s gear cache. You use them to connect yourself to your rope~ your rope to your partner~ your rope to your gear~ your gear to your harness. This is why we typically have more carabiners than anything else~ and why picking the right carabiner is so important. This review is about the biner used for 90% of tasks — racking~ clipping into rope~ and clipping into gear. A standard double rack will contain about 42 of these (12 draws + 18 cam/nut racking biners) so optimizing your choice here is the best approach to lighten up your rack and improve the functionality of your connections. Carabiner technology is constantly improving. Light clean-nose carabiners are the evolution of the wire-gate — reducing snagging to improve usability and safety. Snags of the rope or a sling sometimes are the difference between a closed~ correctly oriented carabiner and a cross-loaded or open one~ which is about 50% as strong. CAMP does a good job striking a balance between weight and usability by being innovative with materials and design. I love what they’ve created with the Photon Wire carabiner – it’s the lightest full-size carabiner out there – but it has obvious weaknesses: The gate tension is pretty soft~ it can be awkward to hold~ and it has a conventional snaggy hook nose. For a long time I thought CAMP had a chance of making the best carabiner in the category if they could deal with these issues. With the new Dyon~ did they? This new carabiner has an exceptionally asymmetric body~ and an interesting new hybrid wire-gate design~ facilitating a clean-nose lightweight carabiner. This is intended to be a multi-part~ on-going review – starting off with first impressions and some nerdy measurements. I’ll try to update this review every few weeks. The weight of a carabiner is an important consideration when carrying a big load of gear. Saving 10g per biner adds up to about a pound for a double rack. I weighed a bunch of biners I had laying around using my fancy chemical scale (Table 1). The Dyon is 2g heavier than the Photon Wire and lighter than the other full size biners. The Ange S and Nano 22 are lighter~ but those are in a different category of carabiner focused on weight savings. For me~ these sacrifice performance~ especially in ice climbing. Figure 1 shows the other biners I measured. Note that the Photon Wire and Nano 22 used for comparison here are last year’s model (CAMP recently updated these). The Nose width determines how easy it is to clip into gear. Old pins and chain links can be pretty narrow and indeed I’ve had issues clipping into things with the BD Hoodwire’s impressive 11.5mm nose (I measured the widest part of the nose with my fancy calipers in Table 1). The Dyon has the smallest nose by an onion skin (very similar to the others from CAMP) so it shouldn’t have issues clipping into the gnarliest Weissner pins still occupying Gunks cracks or the exact chain link that will give you just enough extension to reach that ledge but not interfere with the rappel ropes. Figure 2 shows the profile of a Dyon compared to a Photon Wire. The width of the top of the basket of the carabiner is important for racking. You can fit fewer racking carabiners on a gear loop if it’s wider at the top. 1mm may not seem like much of a difference on its own but for 10 cams it can make all the difference between too tight to unclip comfortably and just fine. I measured the top of the basket at the widest part of each carabiner in Table 1. The winner of thinnest profile is the Oval Wire~ so you should use those to rack all of your pitons and hexes. A close second is the Nano 22 at 7.9mm~ then Dyon~ Photon and the Ange S at ~9mm. The Dyon has the same light hand-feel (density?) as a Photon Wire and the finish is high quality. Gate action is much tighter than a Photon Wire and it's definitely more natural to hold. The spine is radically different (convex vs concave) and to me that makes all the difference in ease of handling (Figure 3). Manipulating the gate feels ergonomic and natural as the thumb naturally gravitates toward a little notch at the bottom of the receiver (the new piece at the end of the wire-gate). The inner surface of the carabiner has very pronounced grooves on the major axis to keep things oriented correctly~ but 2 areas are potentially prone to snagging (Figure 4). The rivet end of the gate is flat (blue arrow)~ making an abrupt angle coming out of the crotch of the carabiner (small end opposite the basket). Another potential area is at the point where the receiver sits on the nose on the inner surface creating a very small~ smooth bump (green arrow). I don’t know if they are actually prone to snagging yet~ but I’ll be testing that. Some carabiners have a hole in the gate which can help reduce freezing / jamming due to accumulation. The receiver pocket in the Dyon does not have such a hole (Figure 5~ green arrow). The open-gate strength of the Dyon is 11kN. That’s higher than any other Aluminum carabiner I know of. The combination of reduced snagging and increased strength is actually a huge step up in safety. Aside from general usability~ clip-ability~ and feel~ I plan to specifically evaluate: -How likely is the pocket to collect debris~ ice~ and freeze? -How likely is the gate to open against rock if not properly managed? -What is the tendency of the above-described features (Fig 4) to snag? Stay tuned! Full disclosure: I received a set of Dyon biners and QDs for the purposes of this review~ but all opinions~ observations~ and measurements expressed here are my own.              Update #1 (6/20/17): Review of Dyon Quick Draws following field testing CAMP is making 3 types of Dyon Quick Draws (QDs). One with 2 Dyons with the skinny sling~ 2 Dyons with a wide sling~ and a hybrid Dyon+Photon straight-gate with a wide sling.  I took the QDs out for late-season ice and really enjoyed using them. They are light and easy to clip with gloves on. So far no issues with gate freezing. I used the Dyon QDs alongside Chimera~ Alpha Trad~ Alpha Sport~ and BD Oz QDs for sport climbing. For sport climbing weight is much less important and typically I prefer something super beefy with a wide dogbone like the DMM Alpha Sport but I really liked the wide-sling Dyon and Dyon-Photon QDs. For reference~ the weight difference between the Dyon  and wide-sling DMM/Petzl QDs is about 20-30g per QD. I’m not going to try to grade clipping / handling but after getting used to them my partners and I had no significant issues. The tight gate tension on the Dyon is very noticeable at first and requires conscious adjustment. The super skinny nose is maybe my favorite feature of the Dyon because it makes them SO easy to clean on steep terrain and it fits much more easily into a bolt hanger already occupied by another draw or rusty link compared to chimeras~ Oz~ or Alphas.   On the photon in the hybrid QDs~ the gate is notched (like the Petzl Spirits and DMM Alpha Sport)~ which adds feedback and improves handling. The mixed QD is also easier to mount on the beta clip stick I use than the all-Dyon ones because the Dyon gate tends to slip out of the metal clip that holds the gate open. The mixed QD is a couple bucks cheaper too. Overall these are really nice QDs that can be used for a wide range of styles because of low weight and good performance.  ,Mar 2015,Mar 9 2017,4
1956,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,1," Thanks for your detailed review (thus far) and look forward to hearing more.   Some thoughts on lightweight carabiners (and reviews of them in general). Most of these thoughts are rooted in anecdotal experience rather than ""data""~ but for me this is more important than just about every carabiner stat except weight. These are the kinds of things I want to think about (not the numbers) when considering gear purchases.   1) You mention nose width. I agree that a narrow nose is much easier to slot through gear (and pins). Hoodwires (and their OZ brethren) are terrible in this regard. The ANGE is by far the best I've ever used (though they have other problems). However~ you also mention a narrow ""basket width"" as being an advantage for racking~ and while I agree with this I also think that a wide basket generally equates to a wider rope bearing surface which is much easier on the rope. The horrible~ narrow radius of a Nano 22 is the major reason I won't use them.   2) CAMP is notorious for having QC issues with their lightweight carabiners - mainly with their gates. There are many posts out there about the crappy Photon gates and I've seen so many Nanos in the field with sticky gates that it is a red flag. Furthermore~ while these two carabiners are shockingly light~ and good ""on paper""~ they also feel frighteningly thin - no big deal when circumstances are perfect but lay one over a tiny edge or bump and~ personally~ I start worrying that they'll snap right in half. The OZ is the same way.  I know that loading a biner the wrong way can break ANY carabiner~ but I prefer a bit more metal even at the expense of weight/size... The Neutrino~ for example~ feels more burly~ as do carabiners with more pronounced I-beam designs (Helium~ Spirit~ ANGE). And regarding overall quality~ just pick up a DMM Chimera or Phantom (or even a Metolius FS Mini) and it simple ""feels"" way better than a Photon or Nano. Tighter tolerances~ stiff and even gate tension~ etc.    3) Usability... not just how easy it is to clip and unclip~ but does it rack well (and slid off a gear loop easily) and does it stay oriented on a sling (or does it tend to invert or worse~ cross load)?    CAMP is doing some things right - lots of colors for racking (hello PETZL?!) and relatively low cost. I'm curious to see how the Dyon stacks up... Thanks again for the review.",Jun 2001,Mar 15 2017,2
1957,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,2, Hey Josh -- thanks for your comments. This is exactly what I'm looking for as I carry on with the review process. In my assessments I try to deal as much as possible with objective measures. How many times have you read a glowing review about how a product feels and functions in one reviewer's hands~ only to be surprised when you pick it up yourself? I will for sure describe usability but will always try to bring it back to facts such as measurements and widely-recognized references~ to give you the best depiction of how something really looks~ feels~ and works. ,Mar 2015,Mar 16 2017,1

1959,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,4, With both the Photon (which I have many of) and the Nano (which I don't) CAMP has made pretty compelling though flawed products. The are both among the lightest carabiners available for their respective sizes~ and on top of that they are also super cheap. Downside is this shows in the weak~ sticky gates (which I see in my own Photons). A serious flaw~ but I'd say top 3 criteria for a biner is going to be weight~ gate~ and cost. It's usually a game of pick 2~ they did light+cheap fairly well.   At $15/biner and focused on a fancy gate~ the Dyon really needs to be compared against the other biners that prioritize weight+gate at expense of cost. WC Helium~ DMM Alpha Light (also Chimera~ Phantom~ and other alpha variants)~ etc. Saying it's lighter and nicer than the Hoodwire or Photon doesn't mean much when those are $6-7 a biner.   Anyways~ thanks for your work on a review~ just some of my thoughts on the topic. The Dyon does look pretty neat. And of course you don't have access to every biner on the market and you're just working with what you have.,May 2011,Mar 16 2017,0

1963,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,8, Well~ I handled a Dyon today and I was surprised by it: The build quality seems a bit better than other CAMP carabiners (Photons and Nanos); the gate tension was firmer and the tolerances seemed tighter. It seemed very clippable.,Jun 2001,May 18 2017,0
1964,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,9, So I was at the gear shop today and fondling away and I was comparing the dyon with the photon that I currently use for lots of my draws and some of my racking biners. I noticed that the photons got a nice little update and here's my comparison of all three (old photon~ new photon~ dyon): The old photons had the worst spring action~ really weak and scratchy and the dyons had a much stronger spring action while the new photons were somewhere in between. I've never had sticky gate issues with my photons or nanos but the issue is well documented. I think the dyons would do a lot better in this regard as the spring just felt much more robust. I liked the shape of dyons much better than the photons as it is much less clunky and more curved. The new photons are a bit better than the old ones in this regard but nowhere near as good as the dyon. For me the new photons were tied with the dyons in ease of clipping. The dyon's shape made clipper easy~ but I liked the spring action better on the new photons. I think the dyons filled a sort of void in CAMP's line of biners and I really like them.  However~ I don't think they will replace the photons for me for a few reasons. First of all is the price point~ they are much more expensive then their photon and nano sibling. They are also slightly heavier than the photons~ and while I like the snag free nose~ it's not a huge selling point for me personally because I don't really mind the lip on other biners. With an adjustment to my hand movements~ I rarely get biners snagged except for Omega Pacific biners which are always horrible when it comes to snagging. The snag free nose is probably my favorite out of the various snag free wiregate designs. ,May 2014,May 19 2017,1

1967,CAMP Dyon carabiner detailed review (UPDATED),1,12, I think almost everyone has heard of this issue. Unfortunate that they can produce such lightweight biners with good potential only to be undermined by the faulty gates. However~ I've heard that CAMP is very easy to deal with when it comes to having any Photons/Nanos replaced due to a sticky gate. Better to not have them stick in the first place~ but always nice to see a company committed to keeping your investment going.,Mar 2017,Aug 9 2017,0

1975,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,1,0," I've had at least 6-7 pairs over the years. Yes~ they are very lightweight. Yes~ the fabric is nice and stretchy for easy movement. Yes~ the zipper pocket~ on the men's version~ fits a phone or Cliff bar really well. However~ after years of loyal support and endorsement of these pants~ I've come to see the truth: Prana Zion Stretch pants really aren't that great. First of all~ the fit is baggy~ loose~ and dumb-looking. More importantly~ the fabric is softer than a Red Rocks trade route. I've completely blown out the knees and butt on a pair of Zion Stretch pants in as little as six months. My wife sews them back together~ but the patches just rip off. The fabric isn't hearty enough to hold a stitch. Maybe if I was one of those pansy gym climbers~ dead set on ""ruining climbing~"" these pants would last me a few years. But as an all-around rock climber~ I need something more durable. I don't want to spend $85 every year~ and I definitely don't want to send a pair of pants to the landfill every year.  When I search the forums for ""climbing pants recommendations~"" I see page after page of people raving about the Prana Zion Stretch pants. I get it. I used to be like you. However~ I suspect that many of us think the Zion Stretch pant is great only because we don't know any better. There has to be a better pair of pants for rock climbers. What do you got MP? Give me your recommendations. I want something durable but also breathable and non-restrictive. ",Apr 2012,Oct 29 2018,47

1991,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,1,16, Sorry to hear the fabric isn't holding up since I just bought a pair of the Brion Pant which is the same fabric in a slimmer cut (still a little baggy in the lower leg though). I was happy when I found these because they looked similar to the discontinued and very much missed Patagonia Rhythm pants~ which I believe Ron Kauk helped design. They had the styling of a pair of jeans but with technical fabric similar to the Stretch Zion Fabric Prana is using. Although it must have been different as I never had any durability issue with them. The fabric finally wore so thin on the butt from years of use that I had to retire them out of respect for my belayers. I actually think the Prana Brion pant would be about perfect for me if the legs were a little more tapered and the fabric was slightly thicker~ more durable. But then that would make them less desirable on a hot day. Note: Prana makes 5 styles of pant with Stretch Zion Fabric.,Oct 2018,Oct 29 2018,2

2041,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,4,5, Eddie Bauer~ the guide pros are nice~ unfortunately the cargo pocket will blow out in your first week of climbing in them. The pocket isn’t structural~ so they are still good pants~ you just lose the only functionally sized thigh pocket I’ve ever seen on any brand of climbing pants.  They just keep warrantying them for me though.  The horizon guides are the same or similar material. I’ve beat the crap out of my pair. Lots of chimneys~ lots of thorns.

The zippered thigh cargo pocket I totally a functional size~ plus it is sewn internally thus no ripping off. I’ve had mine for about 5-6 years and the only abrasion in the fabric is a tiny thing on the right leg. I have used these for everything and they hold up to the abuse. The only thing I can say is that after all this time some of the stitching is coming out/disintegrating~ but that is mostly the rear pockets~ from chimneys and butt sliding down stuff. Easy enough fix and the fabric is still flawless. Cargo pocket,Mar 2014,Oct 31 2018,2
2043,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,4,7, While we are piling on the Prana hate~ anyone else dislike how short the zipper on the fly is? (Insert dick measuring joke here). When wearing a harness I hate relieving myself through that tiny opening~ so annoying.  The little plastic snaps to keep the pants rolled up seem unnecessary and annoying too. For the Ferossi lovers~ have your pants pilled much? I am on my third pair. I think my first pair~ probably 8 years old~ wore really well. However my two newer pairs pilled like crazy in less than a year. The Ferossi fabric probably still feels the best to me for climbing (lots of spandex~ 14%~ equals lots of stretch) but I think OR changes their materials a lot and not always for the better.  With the pilling and poor cuts on both the regular and crag pants version~ I think I am ready to move on from Ferrossis.,Oct 2018,Nov 1 2018,2

Every pair of Brion/Zion pants I've ever owned has lost its elasticity and turned baggy after a year or so of use~ sometimes much sooner than that (1 month in the case of a recent pair that I subsequently returned). It's frustrating~ particularly as the Zions are baggy enough already and I buy the Brions because they fit so well out of the box. ,Nov 2012,Nov 1 2018,3

Have 3-4 pair of Zions and are great travel pants - passport fits perfectly in side pocket~ stain resistant~ ok walk around and ok climb. Not durable~ stick to my skin when sweaty~ but freezing when temp drops at all. I'm always cold in them. Waist is low and rlides down below my harness so my harness is against my skin.

2051,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,4,15, Yeah~ I worked at a small mom and pop in GJ for several years. Very little these days is distribution problem as most companies re ultimately owend by the same compny that is delivering to Wally World down the street. We actually stopped selling The North Face geaf fo a long time in GJ because we found the same stuff at Sam's Club down the street (for lower prices). I love true mountaineering shops and support them when possible (although me wife did work at REI for a while running their community outreach program in ABQ). Gear~ rock shoes~ service~ etc is worth a premium. Prana jeans vs Wranglers is a business decision to get $ out of our pockets withought providing anything that we really need. Look at the marketing. The product descriptions. Then do a blind pants test on your proj and tell me that the $ is worth it. I agree with you to a limited extent~ but the fact is that they are trying hard to sell you something for a premium that you don't need~ regardless of whether there is a distrobution problem. The mom and pop stores are in it for you~ but not necessarily the companies. They realy don't care about you. If they did~ they would agree that you should keep your extra $50 you earned and buy the Wranglers. All of these companies get big. I met the orriginal sewers for Marmot (3 spanish women in GJ). Now they are a global marketing force. Their gear is great~ and I'll spend the money for things that I need at a premium. Not climbing pants. I'd rather save $ on pants and give mom and pop the extra money for something special/unique they can provide. Like sitting down with them and trying on every pair of climbing shoes to buy that perfect pair (and not writing down the size and ordering it online). Or tryig on a loaded pack. Or buying a guidebook and talking with the locals~ etc.  joe,Apr 2013,Nov 2 2018,8

2057,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,5,1, I too have had better experience with Prana: I have one pair of ZION PANT.. I can't say how old they are because I've had them so long~ climbed in them for several years. The only thing I've had to repair is the front button. Sewed a new one on and they're a-0kay! That said~ I don't like any of the new line of Zions~ they just don't feel right anymore.  I love my dead bird PSIPHON SL PANT. They're my favorite for cool to moderate temps. But I got them on clearance for $60~ I'd never pay full price for them.  My best alpine pant is the KHUL KLASH. Holy smokes they're amazing~ early or late season alpine in the Sierra these things are a blessing. Most comfortable and self-regulating pant I've every owned. Soft shell-ish.  At Josh the only thing that gets wrecked are my sun shirts... pants never get thrashed; maybe I'm just not climbing hard enough. ,Aug 2013,Nov 2 2018,1

2062,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,5,6, Arborwear Flex pants~ like Carhartts but built for Arborists. Literally work pants designed to be climbed in. I've blown out a pair of pants pretty much consistently every 4 months since I was in highschool and these are the first pair I've ever owned that stand the test of time (admittedly I've only been wearing them 6 months~ but so far they're bomber). Only downside is they're cotton which is a no-no if you're planning on getting them wet~ but who really wants to climb in the rain?,Jun 2018,Nov 26 2018,0
2063,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,5,7, So I finally got a few days to thrash those Wrangler Flex pants on some sandstone. They seem less durable than the Zions. The first offwidth pitch I climbed I put a hole in the left knee~ the second one a hole in the right knee. They're thinner than the Prana Zions so it's not too surprising~ though I thought they might hold up better than that on sandstone. After about 5 climbing days (mostly not offwidth) they had a number of holes in the knees. The holes form similar to the Prana Zions though; they don't really rip~ the thread just kind of comes apart leaving a smallish hole that's fairly easy to patch. A small bit of Gorilla tape on the inside and you're almost as good as new... Not sure if I'll buy another pair though. The Zions cost 2-3 times as much~ but I think last 2-3 times longer.,Aug 2012,Nov 28 2018,0

2096,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,7,0, FWIW Wearing Stretch Zions now that I probably bought about 6 years back. No holes yet. Fabric is holding up fairly well. While I have certainly used these in some chimneys~ if I know I'm doing any significant amount of chimney or OW I'll usually dress appropriately. Disposable stretch denim jeans of some kind + knee pads under it~ disposable long sleeve shirt~ hopefully with a bit of stretch or oversized. The stretch zions are kinda my summer light bushwhacking and climbing pants. They don't handle cold well. Kinda wish they had cargo pockets on both sides as I tend to overload the one with bars. I had a pair of the Brions~ and they are better looking. The size was wrong for me so resold them. Lack of the built in waist belt was a detraction as well~ but now that I know how to sew that is not a concern any more. Lack of a cargo pocket wasn't nice~ and that would be more annoying to try to add. OR Ferrosi Pants are quite thin. Unfortunately they are NOT the same material as found throughout the OR Ferrosi hoody... They appear to be similar to the thinner stretchy material found in just a small section near the cuffs to allow more stretch. I was hoping they would be the same material as the bulk of the Ferrosi Hoody as I have one and it has lasted admirably. I have put it on so often as bushwhacking pro or OW pro for shirts and fleeces~ or puffys when colder and significant chimney/OW pitches on a climb. Yeah~ it has some holes forming~ but they are still small. Mostly the fabric is just being abraded thinner and thinner near the lower back (I don't always tuck it under the harness) and a bit on the shoulders from OW. (How much Chimney/OW? For the Ferrosi Hoody at least 4 laps on Chrysler Crack~ 3 trips up Tunnel Vision~ Group Therapy~ 5+ laps on the hard side of Plumbers Crack~ 2+ laps on the easy side~ 10+ laps on the easy dihedral OW behind plumbers crack~ and many other forgotten chimneys and short sections of OW.) As is the OR Ferrosi Pants are a nice light weight summer pant where I expect minimal bushwhacking. Really very light. Not what I would want to take up a chimney~ though I have done MysterZ in them twice now~ they have not handled it as well as I would expect the stretch zions to. I have the feeling that they may handle cold breeze when your sweaty ever so slightly better than the stretch zions... But either way~ if your expecting that you should just use some other mildly softshell pants. Destroyed one pair of American Eagle stretch denim jeans on OW so far. Have a second to destroy still. I should probably keep the destroyed pair and cut them up to add reinforcement to the intact pair. Should not have gotten the legs quite so tight~ makes it hard to get knee pads underneath. They look good though. Waist stretches out with sweat as expected. I'm curious how the Patagonia hemp blend stretch pants would holdup for OW.,Feb 2013,Jul 11 2019,1

2098,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,7,2, On my second pair of stretch Zions and I agree with original poster.   They tend to wear quickly.   In fact~ most performance climbing attire wears quickly~ especially if you abuse it~ chimneying~ bushwhacking~ and typical adventure climbing.  I recommend Target - soccer pants.  They give more range of movement and seem to actually last longer- although they are not very stylish - but whatever.  ,Oct 2007,Jul 11 2019,0

2101,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,7,5, (good god how is this thread still going?) OP is horrendously wrong. The fit is only baggy if you have weak legs. The size 35s that fit my waist are like yoga pants on my thighs. I cannot even imagine what the point of the new slim fit version is. They don't cost $80~ they cost $50~ because we're smart people that buy things on sale. It helps that Prana changes colors every year so they go on clearance very predictably. Buy on eBay~ or in the MP FS forum~ and you can spend even less. I tried a pair of the $20 Costco zion-alikes mentioned in the deals thread~ and they just show why it's worth paying more for the Pranas.,Jul 2015,Jul 13 2019,3

2108,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,7,12, I have to disagree. I got a pair last fall that I've been using non-stop indoors and out~ and they are still in awesome shape. After several outdoor trips~ being covered and mud and scrapped over rocks~ they look almost new. I for one will be buying another pair soon. As far as looks go I partially agree; they are baggy and not exactly Lookers. However that's kind of the point. I buy them to climb in~ and for that I WANT them baggy.,Oct 2018,Jul 28 2019,1

2113,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,7,17, Zion slim (straight) should have a better fit. Zion is a hike/climbing pants~ and as such it's a bit baggy. Tighter pants feel worse when sweaty/dirty. Also checkout Brion. Same pants without all the tech stuff like sinch belt and side pockets. Fits a bit slim as well. It just looks like a simple slack. I wear it to my desk job~ I wear it on my dates~ I wore a new pair to a formal wedding~ I wear it to climb~ and I even wore it on a 10+ miles winter run without feeling much discomfort. Now I wear Brion exclusively. It's not that I don't want to wear them exclusively~ but I just don't see any point in any other pants. ,Mar 2018,Nov 11 2019,0
2114,Fact: The Prana Zion Stretch pants aren't that great. ,7,18, Same. Ive switched to Brion pants. I wear them to work~ the gym and outside for climbing. They fit more slim than the Zion pants~ which are too baggy for my taste.,Sep 2013,Nov 15 2019,1

2127,Scarpa Helix- Underated Trad shoe?,1,0, I’m wondering if anyone else climbs in these. Basically with flat shoes it boils down to fit~ and quality of construction and stiffness preference. Being an old school guy I picked these up on a whim because they reminded me of shoes I climbed in years ago. Simple~ solid design. They broke in in no time flat and remained stable unlike Mythos which just keeps on stretching. These also feel a bit more precise than the Mythos. They use the same rubber as Mythos~ TC Pros~ Miuras. (Vibram Edge.) And for a wider foot guy they feel fantastic. What’s not to like? The best part is since they are marketed as a beginner shoe~ you can find them cheap from new climbers who wore them to the gym for a couple trips and decided they had to wear Solutions to get better.  I may have them re-soled in slightly softer rubber st some point and use the  Mythos on hot days and the Helix for cooler days. Anyone else think these are an unsung all arounder? Granted~ I’ve never climbed in Blancos or Pinks but I’m wondering how they compare~ (rubber aside),Mar 2019,Nov 22 2019,4

2130,Scarpa Helix- Underated Trad shoe?,1,3, Same rubber used in a dozen other shoes that run twice as much. Edge rubber is great for its intended use. It’s meant to be a hard wearing rubber for edging~ smeadging on granite etc. But no~ it’s not going to be as sticky as other offerings from Vibram or C4. ,Mar 2019,Nov 23 2019,0
2131,Scarpa Helix- Underated Trad shoe?,1,4, Same rubber used in a dozen other shoes that run twice as much. Edge rubber is great for its intended use. It’s meant to be a hard wearing rubber for edging~ smeadging on granite etc. But no~ it’s not going to be as sticky as other offerings from Vibram or C4.  I stand corrected- I had the previous version helix~ which used a budget scarpa kind of rubber that was total crap. xs edge is great and I would totally rock these new generation shoes with xs edge.,Jan 2017,Nov 23 2019,0
2132,Scarpa Helix- Underated Trad shoe?,1,5, they are surprisingly good up to 5.11~ and comfy af~ even in winter!  i wear a size 46~ streetsize 47.5... does anyone know how they compare to the newish maestros ind terms of fit and sizing?,Jul 2018,Dec 2 2019,0
2133,Mad Rock Drones?,1,0, Anyone have any experience with MR drones? I've never worn Mad Rocks and I've heard mixed reviews about them in general~ but mostly good things about the drones.

2134,Mad Rock Drones?,1,1, One thing to take into consideration is that drones aren’t allowed in national parks..... so....,Feb 2009,Nov 29 2019,13
2135,Mad Rock Drones?,1,2, I tried them for a few hours in the gym.  Madrock was doing a shoe demo and I was on the hunt for new gym shoes.   They only had the HV which surprisingly fit nicely.  You don't need to size down at all.  My street size in the drone was super tight and would be the right size for me. I felt like they had quite a bit of edging power but really lacked sensitivity.  They felt stiff and clunky to me.  So I passed on buying a pair of these even with the demo discount. ,May 2019,Nov 29 2019,2
2136,Mad Rock Drones?,1,3, i tried the LV at a demo with my regular street shoe. i found them to be pretty intuitive on easy boulders. the demo promo code made them stupid cheap compared to a comparable slipper like the instinct vs but i passed on it~ not for any particular reason against the shoe especially with prices of slippers and resoles going through the roof. ,Aug 2013,Nov 29 2019,1
2137,Mad Rock Drones?,1,4, I actually just bought a pair of the HV 10 minutes ago. I tried them at a gym demo and what sold me was the fit. When on~ my heel is just locked and has no movement at all. They are also surprisingly comfy. Also~ I was pretty happy with how well they smear compared to my Scarpa Helix even though they are much more aggressive of a shoe (maybe the newer rubber contributed to that). I can't really compare to any of the other higher end shoes except for the Vapors that do seem to be a bit stiffer and sensitive. In terms of sizing they fit pretty normally compared to a street shoe. I typically wear anywhere from 7.5 to 8.5 and settled on a 41 EU (8 US) compared to my leather Helix (40.5 EU). I tried the LV and HV~ I found that they're both made narrower than I expected~ I could have worn an LV~ but it was just uncomfortable~ the HV were a perfect fit. Most girls trying them also ended up preferring the HV~ not sure if that means anything. Price is very competitive too. Theyre 25% off on madrock's website right now and if you find your size on campsaver or backcountry you get 5% or 14% cashback respectively in addition to the 25% Black Friday sale making them about 85-90$ US after cash back.,May 2019,Nov 29 2019,1

2145,Crash pads? Petzl~ Mad Rock~ BD~ Metolius~ Organic?,1,7, The R3 is great - especially when covering uneven ground/rocks.

2146,Crash pads? Petzl~ Mad Rock~ BD~ Metolius~ Organic?,1,8, If you’re planning on taking some higher falls~ the BD Mondo has my vote. I don’t necessarily like everything about the pad (carrying system~ buckles~ and moving it quickly between nearby boulders)~ but I’ve never bottomed out on it as I have on Organic~ Metolious~ Mad Rock~ evolv~ Mammut~ and Petzl pads. It’s pretty stiff~ but that’s why you won’t feel the dirt when you land on it. That being said~ I think BD’s smaller pads kind of suck and would get a different brand of pad for lowballs. For shorter falls~ the pad doesn’t really matter as much and it’s nice to have a variety in pad size and thickness for the different terrain around the problem.,Sep 2010,May 2 2019,0
2147,Crash pads? Petzl~ Mad Rock~ BD~ Metolius~ Organic?,1,9, Organic is just too much money unless you can get some kind of discounts. They do look cool.

2161,2018 Black Diamond Reactor,1,0, Now that it has been out for a while~ I am curious to get people's takes on the 2018 version of the Reactor for ice climbing up to WI6 and mixed up to M8 (ideally with steeper angled~ T-rated picks optimized more for drytooling/mixed. I have handled it in a store and the lower handle felt more comfortable than any other currently available tool~ but I haven't been able to climb with them.  I have been able to try out most other popular ice tools~ but not the Reactor.  I currently own Fuels (shaft a bit too wide and heavy for my liking~ handle a bit too narrow) and Ergonomics (lower grip a bit too wide and square for my liking). From comparing it with the X-dream (which has a very similar overall geometry)~ it seems like the Reactor addresses the three most common complaints with the X-dream (handle too short for people with wider hands~ shaft not stiff enough~ picks not hard enough).,Aug 2013,Nov 19 2019,1
2162,2018 Black Diamond Reactor,1,1, I’ve been using a pair since around the time they came out. A big difference I notice between it and a friend’s xdream is that they’re more head heavy. Between that and the shaft difference you mention the swing feels fairly different; more from the shoulder and less wrist flick. I really like them but I’ve only used it up to maybe wi5 m5 with the stock “natural ice” pick or the “alpine” pick. Great tools in my opinion. Of note though the bd hammer adds even more head weight which feels like a lot despite being a difference of maybe 40 grams after removing the stock head piece.  ,Feb 2019,Nov 19 2019,2
2163,2018 Black Diamond Reactor,1,2, Absolutely love it for pure ice.  I go back to my fuels for anything M6 and above.  ,Apr 2006,Nov 19 2019,1

2165,Trad Harness Help,1,0, Hey! I know there's already a thread on this~ but it's been a while. I wanted to get some recommendations on a good read climbing harness. I've tried the DMM renegade and found it was uncomfortable~ especially on the waist during hanging belays and raps. I tried on the misty mountain Cadillac and found it way too bulky. Just recieved an arc'teryx fl-365 and its already back in the box with a return shipping label on it. The waist fit fine(almost too big)~ but the legs were way too tight. I didn't find it overly comfortable either. Would it be worth trying the ar-395 or will it fit the same. Love my BD solution but I need bigger/ and or more gear loops. Any suggestions? Thanks!!,Jul 2018,Sep 6 2018,0
2166,Trad Harness Help,1,1, The BD Technician is pretty awesome~ I've used it for about 40pitches and its been pretty great. The 5th rear gear loop is perfect for things like anchor building gear/gloves. I can easily fit a double rack of C4s~ full set of nuts~ 4 alpine draws~ extra biners~ slings~ belay devices~ and more. Pretty comfortable on hanging belays and surprisingly light weight~ legs adjust pretty well too. ,Jan 2016,Sep 6 2018,2
2167,Trad Harness Help,1,2, In terms of pure comfort~ nothing beats the Edelrid Orion. It's by far and away the most comfortable harness on the market if it fits you. If you rack on your harness~ you may not love it as there are only 4 gear loops. I don't mind it when I rack on my harness~ but I only do so for redpointing or climbs with a super light rack.,unknown,Sep 6 2018,1
2168,Trad Harness Help,1,3, if you're having trouble with leg fit with the arcteryx harness~ try the womens size. a womens L is a mens M waist with a mens L leg loops. plus the womens harness has way better colors. the ar-395a (or 385a) is the shit.,Sep 2016,Sep 6 2018,6
2169,Trad Harness Help,1,4, Find a harness that fits you. I like my Metolus climb safe because the leg loops have a wide range of adjustment. That’s most important for me because one leg is big and the other is much smaller.... ,Mar 2008,Sep 6 2018,3
2170,Trad Harness Help,1,5, I´m using the arcteryx harness now. I´m very happy with it~ gearloops are huge and i the extra loop at the back is great if you are doing multipitch stuff and need a place for the cordalette~ micro-jacket or other stuff. I spent two days on el cap hauling a heavy pig before bailing and it was comfortable enough for that. For regular single day stuff i find it very comfortable.,Mar 2018,Sep 6 2018,0
2171,Trad Harness Help,1,6, The only climbing shop with a decent selection near me is rock and snow by the gunks~ and I've kind of expended all the options there. That's why I kind of went out on a limb and purchased the arc'teryx online. I checked out the technician there~ but didn't try it on because the gear loops still seemed much to small. I tried the DMM on there and hung in it for a bit~ and it felt okay. As soon as I took it out climbing later that day it was clear it wasn't going to work for me. Any one have experience with the big gun? It looks large like the misty mountain~ but maybe it fits different?  Thanks again guys,Jul 2018,Sep 6 2018,0
2172,Trad Harness Help,1,7, I have a Big Gun. It's very comfortable. If anything it has too many gear loops. I find it to be a little like a backpack with too many pockets. ,Jan 2016,Sep 6 2018,1

2175,Trad Harness Help,1,10, Wild country summit harness. 7 gear loops. The loops are different sizes and not all slanted or curvy and overlapping like other 7 loop harnesses~  so you can actually use all the loops. As comfy as any other harness I've worn. And only like 45 bucks right now. I got an extra so when my current one is done i will be all set. ,Sep 2013,Sep 6 2018,3
2176,Trad Harness Help,1,11, I love my Big Gun. Holds everything and is super comfy when hanging. I've heard complaints that the belt is too wide~ but it fits me fine. But then again~ I'm a big dude.,Oct 2015,Sep 6 2018,1
2177,Trad Harness Help,1,12, Same~ love this harness. Minus the rear/haul loop is too tiny...smaller biners fit~ but its not the easiest to clip.,Sep 2016,Sep 6 2018,0
2178,Trad Harness Help,1,13, Why not make do with the gear loops on the comfortable harness you like and use a shoulder sling too? Lots of benefits from a shoulder sling when climbing trad. Also I didn't notice the gear loops on my solution being all that different from a trad harness I have. There is only so much space on a harness. Plus if I have have a ton of weight dangling from my harness~ then the damn thing is always wanting to slide down. ,Nov 2009,Sep 6 2018,1
2179,Trad Harness Help,1,14, I have the solution and made 2 extra gear loops out of some extra cord. I've been really happy with the 6 loop configuration. I put gear in the front loops. Slings and draws on the middle ones~ and all other gear on the back loops.,Sep 2017,Sep 7 2018,1
2180,Trad Harness Help,1,15, Max~ any way you can send me a pic of what you did? My best Jake,Jul 2018,Sep 7 2018,2
2181,Trad Harness Help,1,16, I also have the Edelrid along with my Arcteryx. The Edelrid is very comfy~ but i prefer the minimalistic feel of the arcteryx while climbing and don´t feel that much of a difference comfort wise. At least i have no problem with hanging belays for a whole day.  Like others I find it to be a major con to not have an extra gearloop on the Edelrid and the haul loop is also very small~ which i find odd on a harness that seems to be geared towards trad stuff and long routes. Other then that~ really great harness.,Mar 2018,Sep 7 2018,0
2182,Trad Harness Help,1,17, I use the BD aspect and am very happy with it. Carry my rack well and I find it comfortable.  I used to use the BD Big Gun~ which was great for hanging in~ but too bulky. Looks lIke they replaced the aspect with the Technician.,May 2010,Sep 7 2018,0
2183,Trad Harness Help,1,18, I've done the same thing on my BD Solution but with just a single gear loop so it looks basically like the new technician's harness rear gear loop. I believe its a Petzl 6mm cord. Experimented with two loops but this gave me more space and functions smoother for me since things can slide to both sides to be grabbed with either hand.  Just tied it on like I would tie a double fisherman's bend around both gear loops. It does a decent job staying in place~ it slides around the loop when there is no gear on it and I have double clipped things to my cord loop and the molded loop accidentally before. I've also intentionally double clipped items like a PAS to this so it is easy to locate; I did this after realizing that clipping both keeps it organized since the cord loop forces everything to sag towards the center. I've used it for belay devices~ spare slings~ 2 double length slings~ shoes for walk off and a bail carabiner or two. Not a perfect solution but I haven't had much of an issue with it since the only things that go on it aren't used while climbing and finding something in a strenuous stance won't be an issue. A rubber keeper could likely be implemented to keep it from moving a little better. The knots could also probably be improved~ they stay tight for the most part but every so often I will need to cinch them down more. ¡Be careful of sitting down at the base of a climb with a Gri Gri on this loop I've done this multiple times and it's not pleasant!,Mar 2017,Sep 7 2018,3

2186,Trad Harness Help,2,0, That feeling when I chose a harness for a long time and recently I bought Arcteryx. And now I have found a lot of good reviews about this equipment here! It's nice to know that you made a good choice. By the way~ I made a choice based on various ratings and reviews around the Internet. So you can trust them :) For me the Arcteryx is very smartly designed to weigh a lot less but still offer loads of support and allow you to feel as comfortable as possible.,Aug 2019,Aug 30 2019,0
2187,Trad Harness Help,2,1, I love my Arcteryx harness more than the average person~ but if you actually weigh one you'll realize that they're on the heavy side. My Arcteryx weighs about 4 ounces more than my BD harness I keep for backup. But the support and comfort is worth every ounce.,Jan 2016,Aug 30 2019,0

2190,Trad Harness Help,2,4, I've done the same thing on my BD Solution but with just a single gear loop so it looks basically like the new technician's harness rear gear loop... I've done something similar~ but with 3mm cord put through 5mm plastic tubing for easier clipping:,Apr 2019,Nov 4 2019,1
2191,Trad Harness Help,2,5, I second the singing rock dome harness. I needed more gear loops (it has 7) and for the price ($60 on sale) ai had to try it. It has worked exceedingly well for keeping gear organized when climbing and it is comfortable and will work for big wall if you get into that one day.,Aug 2018,Nov 9 2019,1
2192,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,0, I started off with the 5.10 Guide Tennies~ which were great for climbing~ terrible for approaches.  In less than half a year the toe blew out so I picked up the Boulder X's.  They are probably the best pair of shoes I've ever owned~ of any kind~ hands down.  The first day I used them I did a 10 mile hike and at no point did I feel any discomfort.  Normally there is a break-in period for shoes but these were amazingly comfortable right out of the box~ I actually forgot I was wearing new shoes because they never bothered me.  They have great heel support (something the 5.10's didn't have) and the extra padding on the tongue makes them feel like pillows.  I accidentally slipped in a stream on a hike and expected to be squeaking and sloshing around for hours.  Not only did they dry incredibly fast but my sock and foot actually dried too which is something I've never experienced.  Usually if my foot gets wet it stays wet.  I can't recommend these shoes enough~ I would wear them everyday but I want to save the wear and tear for climbing.  They are great for aiding as well and the rubber is sticky for approaches.  11/10 will be buying another pair when these die.,Mar 2018,Jun 26 2019,0
2193,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,1, Counter point: Heavy (A pair of lightweight trail runners + climbing shoes can be lighter) Too stiff (I mean if you like aiding...) Not sticky (not even megagrip) Leather + foam soaks up water  HUGE on a harness.  I know there are some people who like old clunky shoes~ which these are great for. But in this day and age most people are better off in TX3's or TX4's,Oct 2011,Jun 26 2019,2
2194,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,2, I use these mostly for aiding~ I avoided the lighter shoes because I don't know if they can handle the abuse.  The shoes don't feel clunky to me~ no heavier than the 5.10's and they don't feel stiff either~ but the 5.10's felt stiff to me.,Mar 2018,Jun 26 2019,0
2195,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,3,,Oct 2011,Jun 27 2019,1
2196,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,4, Too bad LaSpo discontinued the Ganda... I don't aid~ but can second the TX3 for short approaches~ up to 5.easy.  I mostly just wear my Helios 2.0 for places like Eldo or Lumpy. They are super light and have a clip in loop. If I have a heavy pack~ and need to negotiate talus~ these days real hiking boots with a heel welt are so light~ you might as well wear them as approach shoes. and bring a pair of sneakers for the descent.,Jul 2015,Jun 28 2019,1
2197,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,5, Echo the point that they're great for aiding or long days with a lot of weight. Love mine for those uses~ much better than the tennies. If I'm free climbing and moving quicker with the shoes on the back of my harness~ the TX2 is hard to beat. Different tools for different applications.,Apr 2011,Jun 28 2019,2
2198,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,6, I've heard alot of reviews where people say that these shoes fit perfectly right out of the box. Personally~ I tried on various sizes of the Boulder X and it just didn't fit me right. Tried different sock and size combinations and they ended up giving me blisters on both heels. ,Feb 2019,Jun 28 2019,0
2199,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,7, I use them basically as a beefy hiking shoe that can carry weight is actually good on 4th and 5.easy (though not the best). They are awesome with micro-spikes or strap crampons. They are great in ladders. They are pretty waterproof with the high rand as long as you aren't trudging through a river. In heavy NC summer storms~ my feet are ususally the only thing that isn't drenched.,Feb 2016,Jun 28 2019,1
2200,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,8, I love my boulder x shoes I’m on my third pair and that’s not saying they wear out fast My favorite all times are the Guides Made in Italy I also have two pairs of Wildcats a new pair of Nucleos and just picked up a pair of slightly used Mythos Might say I’m a LaSportiva fan,May 2019,Jul 2 2019,0
2201,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,9, And the Mix. Best shoe I've ever worn.,Mar 2015,Jul 3 2019,0
2202,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,10," I debated and read multiple reviews about the Boulder X.  After wearing the Scarpa Crux canvas since about 2013 (and still using them as my ""gym beaters"" to do backpack laps/train)~ I settled for replacing my approach shoes with the La Sportiva TX3 vs the Boulder X.  As others have mentioned the breathability of the Boulder X is a limitation that comes with the durability of its leather upper.  Climbing wise~ I can't compare the Boulder X head to head with the TX3 but I will say that I don't love the way the TX3 feels when climbing.  The ""climbing zone"" compared to my old Scarpa Crux is too limited.  The TX3 feels great hiking and scrambling.  The way I sweat and since I primarily climb in the southeastern US~ I had to favor a canvas/synthetic upper.   Others have mentioned the weight of the Boulder X as an issue~ and that may be a legit concern too.  Think about the quote from Bill Bowerman in Without Limits~ ""(assuming a good miler has a 2 yard stride)...take an ounce off the shoe~ that's 55 pounds of weight you don't have to carry."" All that to say~ very glad it seems the Boulder X is the shoe for you~ just wanted to add some thoughts for anyone that might be debating purchasing a pair.  I know I debated pretty hard about getting them...and if I didn't have such sweaty feet/live in a hot/humid climate~ I would have leaned toward the Boulder X too.",Jun 2013,Jul 6 2019,0
2203,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,11, And the Mix. Best shoe I've ever worn. I'd bet you can still get the Mix from an EU reseller. ,Oct 2011,Jul 7 2019,0
2204,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,12," I really like my TX4's (leather tx3's).  For my foot fit was the biggest difference between the TX4 and Boulder X...Also underfoot the X's felt ""vague"" ",Aug 2012,Jul 8 2019,1
2205,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,13, FYI on the long term durability for the Boulder Xs. I blew the toes of mine after two bigwalls. The next day I talked to a guy who had the same problem after only one~ two weeks after he bought the shoes. They've been good approach shoes but bigwall shoes they are not. The toe rubber is very thin. ,May 2016,Oct 24 2019,0
2206,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,14, What do you recommend for big wall?  I blew out my toe also and had to get a fresh pair two days before my first wall.  They held up but I'm looking at other options.,Mar 2018,Nov 3 2019,0
2207,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,15, I have never done a big wall....but I used to aid climb a lot.  I used a pair of 5.10 Guide high tops that worked very well~ protected my ankles~ but were svelte enough to fit into the step of my aiders well. ,Jul 2015,Nov 4 2019,0
2208,La Sportiva Boulder X,1,16, Love my Boulder Xs. The benefits outweigh the negatives imo. They climb great(Onsighted 5.10 with them) for easier routes and are great for hiking. Durability is the strongest benefit for me~ with that comes the added weight. Tradeoffs.,Mar 2018,Nov 4 2019,0
2209,North Face customer service/warranty,1,0, Sort of related to the forum topic. I had a North Face Tadpole tent that I loaned to friends~ and it came back to me after a month. It had been put away damp/wet and sat for long enough that the fly mildewed and basically became useless at keeping moisture off the tent. After my Whitney trip~ I tossed the fly before flying home. I called North Face to buy a replacement fly~ but they no longer have any. So now I have a perfectly good tent with no fly - gggrrr! The North Face rep said to return the tent and they might do something about a credit towards a new one (even though the tent itself isn’t damaged) Anyway~ took it to the local North Face store~ they sent it back~ confirming email from TNF. A week later~ I get an email with FULL credit for the original price of the tent! Outstanding! Just thought I should share. Great warranty and custom service from North Face.  Cheers Barry,May 2017,Oct 30 2019,12
2210,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,0," Sigh.  So close but...   I've been on the search for what seems like forever for a ""less pointy Miura"".  BITD~ Miuras were my go-to for harder granite cragging.  I didn't fit them tightly and as most know~ Miuras end up with a nice~ nearly flat profile after some breaking in.  The trend towards all this radical downturned~ slingshot rand tension BS has not been in my foots favor.  Unfortunately~ the Miura toe box is a wee bit too pointy for my wide toe / narrow heel feet.  TC Pros have been damn near perfect for most things and although they can squeeze a bit on the outer side after a long bit of time they're pretty close. I still want a low top shoe for those long~ techy granite face climbing days though. The Scarpa Maestro LOW was ordered.  45.5 (I wear a TC Pro in 44 performance fit and 44.5 all day fit.  44 Miuras BITD.  Scarpa Helix 44.5 ) This shoe fit quite well AND felt great but then the ankle/heel area.  Fail.  There's too much material there and it develops weird folds when on my foot near the ankle bone. Lots of heel farting as well. It's as if they used a down turned last not thinking most of the time the foot would be flexed upwards or flat.  Compare to the Helix in the images.  If SCARPA could get the Helix fit in the Maesto low I think they'd have a winner.",Jun 2006,Jun 16 2018,0
2211,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,1, The scarpa vapor lace may be a good alternative. I have a similar foot shape (narrow heel~ wider toes) and wear the instinct VSR~ and I’ve met a few instinct wearers who also love the fit of the vapor lace. They’re also not too pricey,Apr 2018,Jun 16 2018,2
2212,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,2, yeah try the Vapor lace.  It's less pointy than the Miura~ flat~ and very versatile.  It performs well but is still very comfortable for the amount of performance.  It can edge well~ smear way better than a super downturned shoe~ and it holds its own in cracks.  Not the same as a TC Pro in cracks but it holds up to some jamming.  I like it as a face climbing shoe for granite.  I've been using it along with my TC Pros as a 2 shoe quiver for granite.  ,Dec 2007,Jun 16 2018,2
2213,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,3, Thanks guys. These were off my radar for some reason but look to be exactly what I’m looking for. I have a 45.5 inbound now. Will report back. Cheers,Jun 2006,Jun 18 2018,0
2214,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,4, I used to swear by my vapor lace on everything but have slowly transitioned over to the boostic on hard granite face climbing and a large boostic for crack climbing.  I have not tried it on slab but I use a pair of old instinct slippers for slab. Look at the boostic it is not that miuch more aggressive than the vapor and edges like no other shoe I have climbed in.,Aug 2003,Jun 18 2018,0
2215,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,5, I had a similar experience with the Maestro Low. For me the width was great but my toes too curled up and pushing uncomfortably against the rubber in my regular Scarpa size but if I sized up I ended up with too much flex in the toes and a very baggy heel. It's a shame because as you said the shoe is so close~ it just has such an odd fit. I had used the Vapor Lace a while ago and found it was great initially but quickly became too soft and loose. I'm sticking with the TC Pro and Katana Lace.,Mar 2016,Jun 18 2018,0
2216,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,6, You all might want to see consider the 5.10 Quantum Lace~ 1/2 down from street size. I have the same wide duck feet narrow heel and it's a great match. ,Jul 2017,Jun 18 2018,3
2217,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,7, The Miura was my go to shoe for everything until Black Diamond got into the game. The Aspect is now my favorite shoe! Street shoe size for all day comfort~ 1/2 size down for single pitch hard granite cragging. I still love my Miuras for  limestone and  dolomite pockets ~ but for cracks ~ slabs and edging the Aspects are the $%#t!!,Feb 2009,Jun 18 2018,2
2218,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,8, Don't the boostics knuckle your big toe up fairly aggressively? I've only tried on the booster S~ but I thought the last was similar. ,Jan 2015,Jun 20 2018,0
2219,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,9, Don't the boostics knuckle your big toe up fairly aggressively? I've only tried on the booster S~ but I thought the last was similar.  I'm not mike but I have a looser-fit pair of Boostics and yes the shape of the shoe somehow forces my big toe to knuckle. Painful in cracks for me.,Mar 2014,Jun 20 2018,0
2220,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,10, hmm I dont get that knuckling that you talk about. Mine are super comfortable on my feet and I could leave them on for extended periods if I needed to.,Aug 2003,Jun 21 2018,0
2221,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,11, Do you have a significant mortons toe? ,Jan 2015,Jun 21 2018,0
2222,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,12, I have no morton's toe at all. But like I mentioned I dont do a ton of crack climbing in them but they are great on steep granite edging (any rock type for that matter),Aug 2003,Jun 25 2018,0
2223,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,13, I ended up with a pair of Maestro's myself after trying on 14 pairs of shoes in Keswick last month. My previous shoes were the Scarpa Helix~ just like you~ and I found them incredibly comfy. The Maestro's were the best by far of everything I tried though. I don't tend to knuckle my toes and hence have a slightly larger fit but I did get them so they were slightly tight on my toe (I have one foot larger than the other by about a half size~ the larger one fitted tight but not painful - I could wear and walk around the shop without problem. The other~ smaller~ foot was quite tight and I had to remove it after about 3 or 4 minutes. However~ once I got them home and kept wearing them for a while~ I did get a little stretch but not quite enough. Then I bought some shoes stretchers and managed to make space for my big toe. Now I can wear them for most of a session~ taking them off for a few minutes here and there when I have a rest or belay (I don't have to do this but it certainly feels nice!).  The only slack I have in the Maestro is above the toes~ which I presume is the space provided for people who want to knuckle their toes.  My feet are quite narrow~ long and completely flat and a prominent big toe. I have to say I love the Maestro's now although they do fart occasionally (I take this to mean they are fitting particularly well most of the time?),Oct 2018,Dec 5 2018,1
2224,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,14, Farts mean dead space~ it's not a good fit. ,Jan 2015,Dec 7 2018,1
2225,SCARPA Maestro LOWs,1,15, I've since bought a second pair of mid's to complement them as I loved them so much. The farting stopped after a while (as the shoe conformed to my feet). The mids also didn't have as much space above the toe so they fit even better. Very~ very happy with them and the second pair fit slightly better once new (or my feet are less sensitive now),Oct 2018,Oct 29 2019,0
2226,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,0, Any opinions on the absolute best ultralight tents and sleeping bags? I want to be able to pack a fairly small bag for overnights in southeast Alaskan alpine. I've been looking at ZPacks~ and their stuff appears to be both light and like it could stand up to rain and wind. Any experience with this brand? Or thoughts on others? Thanks very much!,Mar 2019,Oct 13 2019,0
2227,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,1, Have you used an ultra option before? What sort of Alaskan alpine are we talking? I personally would go with something like the BD firstlight or the MSR equivalent for anything that involve high winds and/or snow.  I stayed with a buddy in his hyperlite~ while the first night we had good weather~ the second night we had pretty high winds and snow/sleet mix. I ended up walking 13 miles in the middle of the night to the car because there was no way we were sleeping or keeping anything dry. I can see the positives in them~ but only in the right conditions.,Dec 2011,Oct 14 2019,0
2228,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,2," Zpacks are relatively fragile shelters best used in protected tentsites on the Appalachian trail~ which is their intended market. The construction quality is ""meh.""  A good pyramid shelter is probably the best ultralight option for bad weather~ but it's not a bombshelter like a good mountaineering tent. Hyperlite and Locus are the best brands IMO.  The best sleeping bags are made by Nunatak~ Western Mountaineering and Feathered Friends. ",Sep 2013,Oct 14 2019,6
2229,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,3, I’m talking Tongass National Rainforest and the emerald green alpine above it. More rain than snow. Definitely the possibility for high winds and some snow up above tree line. It’s likely that my trips will be somewhat weather dependent~ but this environment is commonly pervasively windy and wet. Though it is markedly less wet in our current climate. I don’t need something for driving snow~ though am looking for something that can handle rain and wind. ,Mar 2019,Oct 14 2019,0
2230,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,4, In those conditions I'd much prefer a TarpTent over the Zpacks tents if you're still looking for lightweight. I have the TarpTent Rainbow and have been happy with it.,Jul 2013,Oct 14 2019,1
2231,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,5, The Duplex is rad.  I probably have 40+ nights (half above treeline) in CO with mine including some super strong winds and  it's in perfect shape.   I've stayed perfectly dry in a couple of heinous downpours and it also has the best waterproof bathtub floor in in the market~ regardless of weight.  The only negative is the metal clip to close the fly is a bit fiddly with one hand in the middle of the night.  I also have a 30F Zpacks sleeping bag and 2 of their packs.  The packs are amazing and the bag is high quality but it turns out~ I prefer a sleeping bag with the mummy hood. ,Jun 2011,Oct 14 2019,0
2232,Thoughts on ZPacks Sleeping Bags and Tents?,1,6, Thanks Jesse. The Duplex is really highly rated for being ultralight and really waterproof—I’m very attracted to it. ,Mar 2019,Oct 14 2019,0

I don't want to carry a big bag~ so I'm trying to find stuff that can pack down small and light while still being functional. It's unlikely I'm going to choose to do an overnight if the weather is really gnarly~ though weather comes up quick and changes even quicker. Or at least it used to. It's all sunshine and butterflies in southeast these days. Only blows 40 or 50~ nothing like it used to do. It's never that cold here~ but it is wet and cool. It's currently blowing pretty robust and raining sideways. A pleasant Fall day.,Mar 2019,Oct 14 2019,1

2251,La Sportiva Kataki,1,0," I just got back from a week in Indian Creek with the La Sportiva Kataki~ and here are a few initial thoughts. The Sportiva Kataki is the lace version of the Otaki and the sister shoe to the softer Skwama. I have worn out a pair of both the Otakis and the Skwamas~ and I'll compare the Kataki to both of those. The Kataki fits like the Otaki and Skwama: wide at the forefoot. But the laces extend down to near the toe~ allowing a more precise fit. The toe is low profile and similar to the Otaki. The Skwama's toe is a bit higher profile and less supple with all the rubber up front. I climbed cracks from fist size down to 5.12 .3-.4 Camalots in the Kataki. I also used them to climb Stolen Chimney~ and I used them for an afternoon of sport climbing at Wall Street. From 5.10 hands to 5.12 fingers to 5.12 edgy face routes~ they performed great. The laces do show some fuzzy wear after several days of jamming in cracks. I imagine if I was there for much longer~ the laces would need to be replaced. They are much stiffer than the Skwama. The Skwama is not only softer in flex~ its XS Grip seems to wear out nearly twice as fast as XS Edge. The benefit of XS Grip is that I think it holds much better on rounded crappy feet frequently encountered while bouldering. The Skwama is definitely better for bouldering and gym climbing for me than the Otaki/Kataki. The more custom fit of the Kataki over the Otaki due to the laces make the Kataki my choice for roped climbing. Some folks may poo on the idea of using an ""aggressive"" shoe like the Kataki for crack climbing. But other folks recognize that shoes like the Katana Lace and Kataki can be great for cracks---especially thin cracks. Anyway~ that's about it at this point. I need to wear them more to have more thoughts on their performance on other terrain. My prior experience with the Otaki and Skwama informs some of what I think I'll find. For example~ I think the S-heel is a gimmick and doesn't do much~ if anything~ for me. I'm really liking this new line from Sportiva.",Oct 2007,Apr 26 2017,4
2252,La Sportiva Kataki,1,1, Thanks for the review!  So if the S-heel is gimmicky~ what is it you like about the line?  It sounds like the Kataki is otherwise basically a Katana Lace.,Jul 2014,Apr 26 2017,1
2253,La Sportiva Kataki,1,2, Thanks~ I've been meaning to try on a pair. How does it compare to the Katana Lace in stiffness? I know the toe box is more asymmetric like the Otaki...,Jul 2006,Apr 26 2017,0
2254,La Sportiva Kataki,1,3," It is very similar in performance to a Katana Lace. Thus the ""Kataki: Katana+Otaki"" name. The fit is different. I couldn't wear a Katana Lace~ but the Kataki fits my foot extremely well. It is similar to a typical Scarpa fit~ but with a slightly larger (less precise for some?) heel. Fit is everything when it comes to shoes. I'm hesitant to endorse how well any shoe fits as different folks' feet are so different. It may be slightly softer than a Katana Lace~ but to be honest I haven't worn a Katana Lace enough to say that's the case",Oct 2007,Apr 26 2017,2
2255,La Sportiva Kataki,1,4," I'm hoping it won't be too much softer than Katana Lace... The Otaki fits my feet better~ so I'm hoping that'll extend to the Kataki. As for the ""typical"" Scarpa fit~ I'm not should there is such a thing. IMO~ the Vapors (more asymmetric like the Otaki~ but narrower and aren't as stiff) fit differently from the Instincts (even between the VS and the current lace~ with the lace having a tighter (narrower & lower profile) toe box in practice) and from the Boost(er/ic)/Dargo/Furia. Not to mention the fit difference between iterations.",Jul 2006,Apr 26 2017,0
2256,La Sportiva Kataki,1,5," They fit very much like an Otaki and are similar in stiffness. I have worn out two pairs of Instinct VS~ each with multiple resoles~ and they were my prior favorite shoe before this new line from Sportiva. I got a pair of the new Instinct Lace in the mail when I got home~ but I haven't tried them yet. Out of the box the new Instinct Lace felt like my toe was really ""up front"" in the toe box. Hard to describe~ but it seemed a bit weird at my toes---as if my big toe was right over (almost beyond) the front edge of the sole~ and I could easily stub my big toe if I wasn't careful. Is ""too precise"" a thing? I appreciate the feedback on Scarpa shoes. My only real experience with them has been the Instinct VS~ Feroce~ and some Generators from way back when",Oct 2007,Apr 26 2017,0

2258,La Sportiva Kataki,1,7, Did you size the Kataki the same size as your Otaki and Skwama?,Jan 2017,Apr 26 2017,0
2259,La Sportiva Kataki,1,8, I went one half size bigger than my old Otaki and Skwama in order for my toes to lie flatter for cracks and longer comfort. My foot measures 10.5~ but I usually wear 11.5 in most street shoes due to width issues. I've owned 2 pairs of Otaki at 43~ one pair of Skwamas at 43~ a current Skwama at 43.5 and the Kataki at 43.5.,Oct 2007,Apr 26 2017,0
2260,La Sportiva Kataki,1,9, Awesome! Thanks for the review. I currently love my pair of Otakis and was eyeing the Katakis when I have to send these in for a resole. Or I was debating just getting another pair of Otakis. Being able to lace up tight to dial in the fit seems nice,Jan 2017,Apr 26 2017,0
2261,La Sportiva Kataki,1,10, Hi Brian~ I just won the Kataki in a prize draw and I'm wondering how to size them since I can't test the shoe before buying them since it's getting shipped to me. I am between 12.5-13 US street shoe size and I'm thinking of getting a 45.5 shoe. What do you think? I also have wide feet and morton's foot~ so I think our fit should be similar. Also~ do you recommend this shoe for gym climbing or should I save it for outdoor stuff? Thanks.  ,May 2017,May 10 2017,1
2262,La Sportiva Kataki,1,11, I would go try on some Sportivas in the store and figure out what size you like. I wear an 11.5 street shoe usually. 43 is a single pitch fit and 43.5 is a multipitch and crack fit,Oct 2007,May 10 2017,0
2263,La Sportiva Kataki,1,12, I found the Skwama and Otaki to fit differently from many other LS shoes. I wear a 43 in Katana Lace~ Miura VS~ TC Pro~ and Testarossa~ but a 43 in the Skwama or Otaki is unusably sloppy.  I bought Skwamas in 42 and have been happy with that.  I don't own the Otaki but I've tried it on a couple of times and would also get it in 42. (I wear a 10.5-11 street shoe~ not that that means much.) Edit: I tried on a Kataki in 42 today. It fits just like the Otaki. It feels a bit softer overall than the Katana Lace but is otherwise shaped and constructed very similarly.,Jul 2015,May 13 2017,0
2264,La Sportiva Kataki,1,13, Anyone want to venture a comparison to the Miura lace up? Those the most precise shoe I've ever worn and I love them for vertical climbing. Unfortunately they're a little too narrow for me to use out of the box and take a long time to break in to anything near comfortable.,Oct 2008,May 13 2017,0
2265,La Sportiva Kataki,1,14, I've got a 41 in the skwama and Otaki and a 42 in the katana lace. Been eyeing these as I love laces. Feels like a 41.5 may be the ticket for me!,Jul 2008,May 16 2017,0
2266,La Sportiva Kataki,1,15, I have all of the shoes mentioned in the La Sportiva line up.  I am not sure why~ (perhaps there were different sizing generations) but I have found that my Otakis are much more precise and have a harder edge than my skwama of the same size.  I’ve taken to using my otaki for harder short routes and the Kataki for longer climbs.  I was also once Miura Guy~ I still love em.  Still trying to figure out how I feel about the Miura XX.,Apr 2007,Oct 11 2017,0
2267,La Sportiva Kataki,1,16, Anyone want to venture a comparison to the Miura lace up? Those the most precise shoe I've ever worn and I love them for vertical climbing. Unfortunately they're a little too narrow for me to use out of the box and take a long time to break in to anything near comfortable. I wear Miura Lace 39 and it's slightly tight even after 1 year. I recently bought Otaki size 39.5 and it's really comfortable after few climbing sessions. I think I should have gone with 39~ but 39.5 comfortable enough. For reference~ my running shoes is size 42 or 8.5 2E (Asics),Jul 2017,Oct 19 2017,1
2268,La Sportiva Kataki,1,17, I had climbed in Otakis for the last year or so and LOVE them.  I have had them resoled a few times and the leather on top is now stretched and I have to crank down on the velcro which is causing some pain~ or else they feel too loose.  I was looking to buy new shoes to replace them and was considering the Kataki - I have TC Pros and had Taratulaces~ and think lace-ups for my more aggressive shoes might be a good idea.  I have read the posts above and it seems that I should maybe get the Katakis in the same size as my Otakis (44).  However~ this website says the Katakis are NOT just lace-up Otakis and size quite differently.  Furthermore~ this website predicts I should get a 44.5 in Katakis.   First question - are Otakis and Katakis really that similar~ or are they truly different shoes? Second question - if I get Katakis~ what size? THANKS!!!,Sep 2017,May 19 2018,0
2269,La Sportiva Kataki,1,18, Splitterchoss is wrong~ the Kataki very much is a lace-up Otaki. Sizing is exactly the same.,Jul 2015,May 20 2018,1

2272,La Sportiva Kataki,2,0, Hey all~ looking to add to the quiver while some shoes are out for a resole. My current go to is a katana lace in 42.5 (slight curl in big toe but overall comfortable). Thinking of the Otaki or Skwama (but was leaning towars the skwama since it seems like the Otaki is pretty similar to the Katana Lace in performance). I’m wanting something easy on/off for bouldering and sport climbing. I like snug but not painful fit...size down in Skwama to 42 for stretch? Thoughts from those that have used both?,Feb 2012,Jun 7 2018,0
2273,La Sportiva Kataki,2,1, I love my Otakis!  I just got my second pair~ after considering other options.  After 1.5 years and three re-soles~ the leather has stretched and the downturn has flattened. I tried Scarp Vapors but they didn't feel right.  I ended up not getting the Katakis exactly because I didn't want to have to deal with laces if I am taking them on/off a lot at gym.  Please note though that I have a wide foot and things like Miuras feel terrible~ even at street shoes size~ while I wear my Otakis very small.  Street shoes is something like a 46~ but I wear Otakis in 44,Sep 2017,Jun 9 2018,0
2274,La Sportiva Kataki,2,2," I have the Katana Lace in 43.5 and the kataki's in 43. kataki's aren't any wider than the Katana lace~ I sized down because I thought they were wider. The toes are so tight but there's about 1/4"" of dead space around the heel~ so the back of my foot slides around on heel hooks and smears~  also fart noises.  They're not as stiff as the Katanas but they came with much thicker souls.  They almost seemed like 5mm.. And the last downside is that they turn your feet blue. But they edge great~  smear OK~  crack well and the rubber is nice and thick",Jun 2017,Jun 10 2018,0
2275,La Sportiva Kataki,2,3," Hey Josh~ what foot shape do you have? I'm getting conflicting information but with a medium volume forefoot and low volume heel I was going to go up a full size from my Katana Lace (42.5) to a 43.5 in the Kataki for a ""comfort/all around fit"".

2276,La Sportiva Kataki,2,4, Thanks for the reply reboot. Were you going for a curled toe or or flat toe fit? ,Feb 2012,Jun 27 2018,0
2277,La Sportiva Kataki,2,5, Great~ thanks again.,Feb 2012,Jun 27 2018,0
2278,La Sportiva Kataki,2,6, I bought the same size (41) in both Katana LU and the Kataki (women’s version). They fit very differently on my feet. Katana has no dead space in the toes. Great for edging~ but can’t smear. The Kataki has a little more space in the toes. More comfortable. Smears great. I didn’t like the XS Grip 2 on the women’s version of the Kataki though. If I had to do it again~ i’d probably go down a 1/2 size in the Kataki. For reference I wear an 8.5 Converse.,Dec 2016,Jun 28 2018,0
2279,La Sportiva Kataki,2,7, Thanks~ Chris. I ended up ordering both a 43 and 43.5 (half size up). I'm wanting this to kinda be my all around shoe and after a full day usually my feet are aching in my Katanas. Hoping the extra toe space with the Kataki solves this issue. Cheers.,Feb 2012,Jun 28 2018,0
2280,La Sportiva Kataki,2,8, That's exactly why I originally decided not to size down on my Katakis. My Katanas were the perfect performance fit~ and I wanted a more comfortable multi-route shoe. I definitely got that with the Katakis. Just be aware that they do stretch quite a lot. Good luck!,Dec 2016,Jun 28 2018,2

2285,La Sportiva Kataki,2,13, Single pitch or multi?  The TC Pros are the only other LS shoe that fits my feet (I got half size bigger than Otakis).  Obviously these are mostly used for all day multi-pitch~ vert/crack/etc~ but I find the stiffness and edging quite good for smaller footholds that require balance~ even in the gym ,Sep 2017,Jul 3 2018,0

2288,La Sportiva Kataki,2,16, The Kataki is a Katana Lace with a wider toe box and S heel. Also is the best all-around shoe in the game. Size 1/2 up for all-day trad. Great for sport too except for cave/huge overhangs. Stretches a little~ so cram it home for sport sizing,Apr 2013,Jul 12 2018,0
2289,La Sportiva Kataki,2,17, The Kataki is not a KL. The Kataki is built on a different last~ the shoe is more asymmetrical and slightly more down turned. The KL is also a stiffer shoe from experience as well. ,Feb 2012,Jul 12 2018,2

2295,La Sportiva Kataki,3,3, Just to add a couple more data points~ I have been climbing in TC Pros (44.5) for cracks mostly in Squamish and Shamans (12) mostly for the bouldering gym but also for the occasional real face climb.  I blew out the toe on my TC Pro trying to stick a smear on a single crystal and my Shamans are nearly worn through the toe too so I figured I'd try something a little different and picked up a pair of Skwamas (44) and a pair of Katakis (44.5).   The Skwamas are a good replacement for the Shamans and fit nearly the same but are not nearly as comfortable.  I've had the Shamans for so long that maybe I don't remember how they felt when they were new.  The Skwamas have a terribly sharp edge on the plastic material under both ankle bones.  I actually took a nail file to the shoe to smooth the sharp edge out and it helped.  I can't believe a $170 shoe would have such an unfinished detail.  Other than the pain in the ankle I really like the way the shoe climbs both in the gym an on real granite.  It's softer both under and over the toes than the Shaman which gives it a little more sensitivity but somehow feel like it edges better too.  That might be due to the broken midsole in my Shamans.  The heel fits well (other than the sharp edge) and stays secure during heel hooks.  Overall the Skwamas are a good addition and I think they will get better as they break in.   I have less days in the Katakis so far~ just a couple of pitches outside and a session in the gym.  Initially they felt too tight~ I was hoping to fit them for finger cracks~ my thinking was that the lower profile toe box might fit better in less-than-hand cracks than the toe on the TC Pros.  Both the TC Pros and the Katakis in a 44.5 leave me with a flat big toe and the rest of my toes are curled.  With the wider toe in the TC Pro my toes aren't as curled as they are in the narrower toe of the Kataki.  As they break in I'm starting to feel more optimistic that I got the sizing right.  My gym session in them gave me the impression that they had all the feel of a wooden clog under the big toe which is a stark contrast to the Skwama but I could stand on the big toe well even with less compression.  My one day climbing outside in them (just a few pitches after teaching some belay skills) left me thinking that I sized them right and that they will work for what I want.  They are not a direct replacement for the TC Pro but I think they will perform better in the smaller cracks.  I'll have to get some more mileage on them to know if they'll stretch as much as the TC Pros did.  If they do then they will be great crack shoes~ if they don't then they'll be good for finger cracks only and not so good for hand cracks where my other toes will get smashed knuckles.  Time will tell.  Someone with narrower feet or different toe shape than mine would have a very different experience comparing the TC Pro and the Kataki for crack climbing.,Apr 2014,Aug 24 2019,1
2296,La Sportiva Kataki,3,4, The Skwama fits very differently for me; can’t wear it. The Otaki a little differently and I probably need a half size larger. The Kataki is a great face climbing shoe~ a little like the Miura lace but not as precise in the toe. However they fit me better and I really like them.,Oct 2008,Aug 24 2019,0
2297,La Sportiva Kataki,3,5, The Otaki feels like a larger volume Miura VS with a less aggressive shape (just as downturned~ but less asymmetrical). Baggier heel (for me).,Jan 2014,Aug 24 2019,0
2298,La Sportiva Kataki,3,6, I have the womens skawama in 40. I just got a pair of women’s Katakis in 41. I got the women’s because I wanted the grip rubber instead of the edge due to the fact I’m a only 136 lbs. there super comfy but I do regret not getting a 40.5. The toe flexes a bit on small holds.

2300,La Sportiva Kataki,3,8," I just got back from a week in Indian Creek with the La Sportiva Kataki~ and here are a few initial thoughts. The Sportiva Kataki is the lace version of the Otaki and the sister shoe to the softer Skwama. I have worn out a pair of both the Otakis and the Skwamas~ and I'll compare the Kataki to both of those. The Kataki fits like the Otaki and Skwama: wide at the forefoot. But the laces extend down to near the toe~ allowing a more precise fit. The toe is low profile and similar to the Otaki. The Skwama's toe is a bit higher profile and less supple with all the rubber up front. I climbed cracks from fist size down to 5.12 .3-.4 Camalots in the Kataki. I also used them to climb Stolen Chimney~ and I used them for an afternoon of sport climbing at Wall Street. From 5.10 hands to 5.12 fingers to 5.12 edgy face routes~ they performed great. The laces do show some fuzzy wear after several days of jamming in cracks. I imagine if I was there for much longer~ the laces would need to be replaced. They are much stiffer than the Skwama. The Skwama is not only softer in flex~ its XS Grip seems to wear out nearly twice as fast as XS Edge. The benefit of XS Grip is that I think it holds much better on rounded crappy feet frequently encountered while bouldering. The Skwama is definitely better for bouldering and gym climbing for me than the Otaki/Kataki. The more custom fit of the Kataki over the Otaki due to the laces make the Kataki my choice for roped climbing. Some folks may poo on the idea of using an ""aggressive"" shoe like the Kataki for crack climbing. But other folks recognize that shoes like the Katana Lace and Kataki can be great for cracks---especially thin cracks. Anyway~ that's about it at this point. I need to wear them more to have more thoughts on their performance on other terrain. My prior experience with the Otaki and Skwama informs some of what I think I'll find. For example~ I think the S-heel is a gimmick and doesn't do much~ if anything~ for me. I'm really liking this new line from Sportiva. When would one choose the Otaki over Kataki?",Jun 2018,Sep 26 2019,0

2302,La Sportiva Kataki,3,10, When would one choose the Otaki over Kataki? I love my kataki! They are stiff compared to my skawama. But I don’t have to bail out of them at the end of each route. I have to women’s so they have to grip rubber compared to edge. But I’m only 62 kilos ,Aug 2019,Sep 27 2019,0

2309,Built To Send X0 Pack Initial Impressions,1,5, What's the benefit of this pack over buying 2 TUFA's for the same(ish) price? Which does have a movable sternum strap~ doesn't have a G Hook~ and is made in the US.  Basically what I'm asking is why is this pack double the price of one with less cons and effectively the same set of pros?,Jan 2017,Sep 24 2019,1
2310,Built To Send X0 Pack Initial Impressions,1,6, Damn~ wasn't expecting that response. As someone who makes packs and quilts and other gear myself~ the brand really appealed to me from a nerdy gear perspective. I made a post about them here~ because I truly found it really interesting. I think they fit an interesting niche in the market with they're use of x-pac~ modularity (like cilo)~ and the sizes that they offer (smallest size starts bigger than the mochilla). I do not think that any one thing in particular they're doing hasn't been done before~ but I do think that they've chosen a pretty cool combination of features. After posting the other thread to see what other people thought and to have a discussion with the other members on here~ Built To Send reached out to me and offered me a discount to enable me to check it out in person and hopefully review. I did pay my own money for the pack~ and quite a bit in my opinion~ just at a discount because I really do think that this pack fits my needs well. In the review~ I very intentionally didn't compare the pack to any others on the market. My goal wasn't to tell you what pack to choose~ as I personally think cilo~ tufa~ CCW~ Alpine Luddites~ and others are all incredible options. I didn't want to draw out similarities~ as you all know the others and you can make informed decisions for yourself about the designs without me telling you what to think. Whether or not the pack looks too similar to the mochilla~ is up for the individual to decide. I personally think they've made their packs to fit into the Alpine climbing category and the mochilla fits a bit more into the leader pack category~ although there is a decent amount of overlap. The mochilla expands to 24L~ while the X0 (their smallest pack) expands to 35L. That being said~ I'm more than happy for you to have a different opinion. ,Mar 2016,Sep 25 2019,1

2312,Built To Send X0 Pack Initial Impressions,1,8, Your mileage may vary~ but all I can draw from is my experience with the BD speed zip and the Patagonia ascensionist. Both are well designed~ but they both get pretty shredded on granite. I've found the dead bird alpha fl is better for durability though. ,Mar 2016,Sep 25 2019,0
2313,Built To Send X0 Pack Initial Impressions,1,9, I've got news for you if you think the mochilla was some sort of revolutionary bag design.... small no-thrills climbing bags tend to all end up pretty similar~ and its been that way for probably 50 years. ,Sep 2013,Sep 25 2019,1
2314,Crag wagon 45 - initial impression,1,0," (initially posted in gear discussion forum by mistake) Just got my Crag wagon 45 last week and put it to the test this week-end. I was able to load it with the following: - 9.5mm 60m rope (stored in the tarp) - 2 pairs of climbing shoes - 2 harnesses - 2 chalk bag - Sport rack of about 14 draws + slings & biners - small lunch for 2 - 1.5L of water - some spare clothing - flip flops - Full size DSLR with mounted lens There was enough space left in the bag that I could have added a helmet on top easilly (my partner had these). Adding a double trad rack would probably mean taking some stuff out as I doubt it would have fit (havn't tried it yet)~ but I'm confident that removing the camera and flip flop would do the trick. Worst case I could carry the rope on top of the pack. Bag stands erect whether fully loaded or empty~ which is nice.  The pack carried very well on the moderate approach and I didn't really feel the weigth. The frame give a nice sturdiness to the bag and it pretty much feel like a hiking packpack when you have it on.   The U-shape zipper makes it super easy to access all you gear so you can pack for weight distribution and not worry about what you'll need first once at the crag. I liked the 2 gear slings inside the main pocket as it is a convenient place to hang stuff that you need on/off like belay glasses/gri-gri etc without fear of someone stepping on them or having them falling out the bag. Top loading when moving to a different area of the crag was super conveninent. The top opening is big enough that you can just chuck everything in no problem. The top pocket works fine~ but I could wish the two zip pockets inside had more volume built into them as you cannot fit much in there in my opinion~ especially with the zipper on the side and not the top of the pockets. If I'm nitpicking I'd also say the leash for the key ring is ridiculously short. That thing is like 3/4"" long and stuck in the corner of the pocket. I'll probably add a small entension on it for ease of use.   The rope tarp that comes with the bag work OK. It is on the small side and I'm not sure how that light material will handle the abuse. There is a tension strap built into it~ but the tarp material is somewhat slippery~ which makes it hard to tension the strap as the tarps just slips on itself when you pull on the strap. Guess it'll take some geting use to. Very happy with my purchase so far as that bag is definitively a big improvement over my previous pack (37L hiking pack). I have it in the blue version and it does looks nice (for now at least - not sure how the color will handle the dirt).  My partner has the BD Creek 50 and while his is clearly the most spacious and sturdy bag~ he was looking at mine with some envy when I fully unziped the U shape access :)",Mar 2019,Sep 9 2019,6
2315,Crag wagon 45 - initial impression,1,1, Thank you for the write up. I've been weighing the Crag Wagon against the Creek 50~ my one hang up being able to pack in a double rack with everything else. The Crag Wagon 60 is an option~ but I feel like that's almost overkill.  Have you had the chance to see what kind of space you have when loading up with a double rack~ minus the camera and shoes?,Jun 2019,Sep 12 2019,0

2319,mammut wall rider,1,2, I've wondered about this helmet as well. I want the Sirocco but the color and shape are... questionable.,May 2011,Jun 9 2016,0
2320,mammut wall rider,1,3, It's pretty similar to the Sirocco in terms of lightness and comfort but I think it's a lot more comfortable/low profile/better looking.,Jun 2016,Jun 9 2016,0

2322,mammut wall rider,1,5, Hi all~ first time chiming in on a thread~ but I think the Sicorro is better. I took this on an 8 month South American climbing trip. It's light~ good looking~ comfortable~ visor~ headlamp compatible~ sheds icefall well~ etc. Pretty much all I need in a helmet~ with the exception of a pretty serious design flaw. It was strapped to my backpack on a slippery alpine descent~ and I fell and it broke along the plastic/EPP foam transition when I slipped. It's a pretty prominent point of weakness that doesn't exist in a side by side comparison with the Petzl Sirocco (and it's a few bucks cheaper). Along each of the three struts on half the helmet! As a mechanical engineer~ I notice that this design could be improved by increasing the bend radii for strain relief~ or just increasing the cross sectional area along the fracture line. What a bummer on an otherwise great helmet. Hope it's addressed in future revisions~ or my next will be a Sirocco (despite how ugly they are~ they've also got a 3 year guarantee that Mammut doesn't have~ as well as being a few bucks cheaper) Whatever~ I put some GOOP on it and lashed it with tape~ as it'll still shed impacts from above~ and feels as sturdy as the other side. To be honest I'm just a little disappointed in the engineering! But yes... it looks good in the crag.,Feb 2015,Jul 19 2017,3
2323,mammut wall rider,1,6, I've been very happy with mine after 15+ years in the petzl meteor. Very light~ I don't even notice it on my head. My only complaint is that the chin buckle slips pretty much every time I wear it. I think the last time I adjusted the strap on the meteor was the day I bought it in 2001 or whatever.,Aug 2007,Jul 19 2017,0

2334,mammut wall rider,1,17, I called and talked to customer service. They just asked for a picture and then sent me a new one! I wanted to add that Mammut has now done the same thing for me~ which is impressive. I guess going forward I'm going have to just pack my helmet as though I'm packing an egg in my luggage. One guy at my local gear shop suggested not checking it at all~ but I've had surprise gate checks too many times to rely on that. He also said that the wallrider can pass through the UIAA impact test multiple times~ which my Meteor apparently cannot do.,Aug 2007,Sep 26 2017,1
2335,mammut wall rider,1,18, Mine was on the side of my harness and got caught under a rock in a talus field on the approach. the side broke off and I superglued and taped it back together for the day of climbing. I guess I'll be calling mammut based on people's experiences with customer service. Otherwise it has been an awesome helmet. Super super light.,Nov 2010,Jun 5 2018,2
2336,mammut wall rider,1,19, The helmet durability is questionable... I used mine in everyday usage(sport climbing~ etc...) and it cracked or had foam gouged out just from shoving it into my pack and moving it around. I will say~ as others have mentioned~ mammut's customer service is second to none and they sent me a replacement right away. They actually sent me another replacement after the foam cracked again. I ended up buying a rock rider for sport and multi-pitch trad and will be using the wall rider for alpine missions(or when I just want to lighten my load). If you're looking for a a daily driver this probably isn't it~ but works great as a lightweight alpine helmet.,Oct 2013,Jun 7 2018,0
2337,mammut wall rider,1,20, Just a little update 2 years on~ my replacement Wall Rider has been good so far~ no further cracking. Could just be coincidence~ but since the first one was damaged while in checked airline baggage~ I've been super careful with the second one when flying. I pack the inside of it with clothes and place it in the center of my biggest bag~ dome up~ with more soft stuff all around. So far so good.  While the helmet is definitely comfortable and light I don't think I'd buy it again due to the fact that the chin strap (at least on both of mine) is constantly slipping. ,Aug 2007,Aug 29 2019,0
2338,mammut wall rider,2,0," I have found the Wall Rider to be much more durable than the BD Vapor it replaced; have been very happy with the fit. too.  The EPP foam has some flex vs. the more rigid EPS foam in many other helmets that tends to crack.  All of the ""foam"" helmets are less rugged than the old hard shells~ but the weight reduction makes that an easy trade-off for me.",Nov 2010,Aug 30 2019,0

2341,mammut wall rider,2,3, I've owned the Wall Rider~ Meteor~ Vector~ and now the Scirocco. I crushed the Wall Rider when it was strapped to the outside of my pack and I dropped the pack without thinking. Prior to that~ I thought it was a step up from the Meteor. Lighter and more comfortable. The Vector only lasted a few months before I noticed cracks in the foam~ whereas the Meteor I got a few years out of without being extra careful. I just started using the Scirocco a few weeks ago and it isn't as comfy as the Vector or Wall Rider but is definitely more rugged. I swore off foam helmets if I can't get at least a year out of it.,Aug 2016,Aug 31 2019,0
2342,mammut wall rider,2,4, This is the only helmet I've ever owned that makes me want to wear a helmet. It's light~ has solid ventilation~ and the all webbing strapping is extremely comfortable compared to the plastic tensioners that most other helmets have nowadays. That right there is 100% more important than anything else to me. For durability~ I am very careful with it during transports. It's clear that the foam construction will not handle a sizable load if you drop a bag on it or something of that sort.,May 2009,Sep 12 2019,0
2343,mammut wall rider,2,5, Dude~ you dropped your pack on your helmet. Not exactly a great way to assess durability.,Mar 2012,Sep 12 2019,3
2344,mammut wall rider,2,6, I LOVE THIS HELMET. I have nothing bad to say. Super comfy to wear with or without a hat underneath~ breaths well and is so light you barely notice it. The fabric strap closure is magically comfy and doesn't give me headaches like the plastic ones do to me on other helmets. I will recommend this helmet to my death,Dec 2017,Sep 14 2019,0

2346,Tenaya Inti -unexpected greatness-,1,0, After much struggling to find a shoe that fits comfortably but also performs well I've found a shoe I love; the Tenaya Inti. Shoes I've worn~ for reference. (Obviously desnt mean they're bad.. just didn't work for me.) Anasazi Pink~ Anasazi Pro~ Moccasyms~ Katana Lace~ TC Pro~ Butora Acros~ Scarpa Instinct VS~ Miura VS~ Team Blacks~ Dragons~ Tenaya Mundaka~ and Tenaya Tarifa. I'd describe the Inti as a medium-soft~ flexible shoe with added stiffness in the toes for surprisingly excellent edging. Sized comfortably it is exceptional for longer routes and smears like a dream while still edging very well. Downsized it's ultra good at edging and excellent for vertical to slightly overhanging routes. It doesn't seem ideal for cracks or pockets and doesn't heel hook very well. It lacks lateral stiffness to comfortably hold up in cracks and the toe isn't ultra precise. The Tarifa seems a better option for pockets and I haven't found a good Tenaya shoe for cracks (maybe the Masai~ but they're ultra narrow and don't fit me). I like the Inti better for slab AND vertical climbing than any other shoe I've tried and highly recommend it. For pockets I'd reach for the Tarifa~ for heel hooks or steep bouldering the Mundaka. Highly recommend trying it out for either a versatile shoe or pure vertical to slightly overhanging sport excellence. Ideal if you like more flexible shoes but also edging support for your toes.,May 2019,Sep 5 2019,0
2347,Tenaya Inti -unexpected greatness-,1,1, Been climbing in the Iati for a few months and  agree it's great. Almost no other shoe fits my foot. I'm thinking about picking up the Mundaka as a more aggressive shoe like you said~ but can you compare the two more? Thanks,Aug 2019,Sep 6 2019,0

2353,Beal Birdie,1,0, After many false annoucements~ it's finally available. Just got a hold of one from Trekinn for $55 (though it looks like it just went up $5). Solid piece of gear. All metal - stainless and aluminum including handle. Quality construction; compact; feeds and lowers at least as good as the Grigri IMO and the handle is wide enough to be comfortable. Slightly heavier than the Grigri because of the all metal construction but who gives a shit if you're sport climbing or TRing. Works with a wide range of ropes (8.5 - 10.5) though I've only used on 9.4 - 9.9.,Dec 2012,Sep 4 2019,3
2354,Beal Birdie,1,1, It will have the same problem as the mad rock lifeguard I bet where the handle gets hella hot if you are rapping fixed lines or lowering a heavy load. Otherwise~ stoked to grab one.,Mar 2016,Sep 4 2019,1

2360,Beal Birdie,1,7, How does it pay out fast for a high clip than? Anyway to over ride the cam without grasping the device~ I don’t think they had a lip on the side of the body? Probably rope dependent somewhat. I've only tried it with 9.4 BD and a 10 Sterling (?). for me it seems the more pliable the rope the better it feeds. It works fine using the two-handed tenchique that Beal shows on their info videos (push/pull).  It would be interesting to play around with it with a range of different ropes to see how tolerant it is to fast feeding. No~ there is no lip on the device like the Grigri but the edge of the plate is rounded and can be fed similar to the Grigri but with my ropes I think it feed freer and faster using the two handed technique. It would probably wear quicker though because that part is aluminum. ,Dec 2012,Sep 5 2019,0

2364,TRAD harness recommendation,1,3, +1 for MM caddy.  I opted for the additional rear gear loop on mine and it's great for whatever your not using mid pitch. The stacked side gear loops take some getting used to~  but I really like them.  It's super comfy on hanging belays and carries weight really well on your hips. ,May 2018,Jul 19 2019,2

2368,TRAD harness recommendation,1,7, I wouldn't bother. all harnesses suck if you have a full trad rack on them. I just put some pieces or the draws on a gear sling. Spreads the weight. That way I don't have a sagging~ mega loaded harness. And I tend no to put everything on the sling if it's a big rack. Otherwise it's hard to select gear from the middle of the pack. the tradeoff of a big waist belt or big wall harness is less mobility. ,Nov 2009,Jul 19 2019,1
2369,TRAD harness recommendation,1,8, Arc'teryx FL-365 is the most comfortable harness with huge gear oops I've found. Love it.,Aug 2014,Jul 20 2019,13
2370,TRAD harness recommendation,1,9, Again for the Misty Mountain Cadillac. I got a custom one last year with double back buckles and a second belay loop. Buckles never creep~ and I love all the gear loops. Fantastic harness. Comfy too.,May 2014,Jul 20 2019,0
2371,TRAD harness recommendation,1,10, Another vote for MM Cadillac. They have a harness builder on their website but if you call them~ they’ll do pretty much anything you ask. I’ve had gear loops in different places~ custom colours~ all kinds of stuff over the years. Edited to add: As others have mentioned~ there are other ways to lighten the load on your harness. I’m skinny so I hate a fully loaded harness~ it just sags. - 3-4 single slings with biners over your shoulder eliminates the need for so many draws.   - use a prussic cord to secure your chalk bag... one less thing on your harness - ultralight running hydration bladder and/or an 8-10l pack is great to avoid water bottles and/or shoes being clipped to your harness. - don’t carry crap you don’t need (ascender~ pulley~ etc),May 2009,Jul 20 2019,1

2374,TRAD harness recommendation,1,13, Had MM Cadillac. Did not like the size or configuration of the gear loops. Gave it away. The Singing Rock Dome is perfect for me. Comfy. Huge gear loops (right on the side of the harness). $60! Has held up great. Saw a crew member for Jimmy Chin wearing one while filming Free Solo.,Apr 2010,Jul 20 2019,1
2375,TRAD harness recommendation,1,14, Dmm renegade. 7 loops~ feels like a normal harness~ not a big waller ,Feb 2017,Jul 20 2019,8
2376,TRAD harness recommendation,1,15, If you are going to be carrying gear only on your harness I really like the BD Big Gun.   The waist belts don’t seem to deform or sag when loaded down like other do.  It’s far from a perfect harness but when I need to carry a lot of crap it’s the one I always go back to.   ,Apr 2012,Jul 20 2019,0
2377,TRAD harness recommendation,1,16, 2nd on the dmm renegade 2 harness. Best harness I've ever had. 7 gear loops~ super comfy. I usually carry doubles from .3 to 3 and there is plenty of room. The pad on the waist loops also slides so you can always have the harness centered. ,Jan 2018,Jul 20 2019,1
2378,TRAD harness recommendation,1,17, The Petzl Adjama is super rad for trad. It’s comfy but not too bulky and the 5th gear loop on the back is super nice to have. ,Sep 2012,Jul 20 2019,6
2379,TRAD harness recommendation,1,18, Just ordered a singing rock dome. Looks sweet! ,Mar 2019,Jul 20 2019,1
2380,TRAD harness recommendation,1,19, I’m very happy with my Yates Shield harness.,Jun 2008,Jul 20 2019,0
2381,TRAD harness recommendation,1,20, Ok~ so I got the Cadillac. It was on my doorstep last night upon returning from beautiful/lovely Tahquitz. The first thing I noticed was the padding. There's really not much difference between the padding on that and my Petzl Corax. The padding feels stiff and is nowhere near as thick as I was imagining for harness that I want to wear for extended hours. My question would be~ first~ for those who have experience with the Cadillac and who have responded with alternatives. Among the Renegade~ Big Gun~ Shield~ FL-365 and Dome - which has the padding?  I tried the Caddy on last night. It felt comfortable enough but that was not racked. The padding feels stiff. I want something soft and cushy.  Thanks for the assists peeps. ,Jun 2019,Jul 23 2019,2
2382,TRAD harness recommendation,2,0, You don’t want soft and cushy~ soft and cushy breaks down fast.  You want wider surface area with firm supportive padding.   Bottom line is that no matter what harness you get a true hanging belay sucks~ you just want to minimize how much suck. ,Apr 2012,Jul 23 2019,8
2383,TRAD harness recommendation,2,1, You don’t want soft and cushy~ soft and cushy breaks down fast.  You want wider surface area with firm supportive padding.   Bottom line is that no matter what harness you get a true hanging belay sucks~ you just want to minimize how much suck.  Well ok~ I still want it but I won't try and find soft/cushy. I guess I'll rack the caddy today and go play and see how it feels. It checked the boxes on loops. ,Jun 2019,Jul 23 2019,0
2384,TRAD harness recommendation,2,2, I was in a similar situation to you when I started getting into trad and I went with the Arc'teryx 395a and I'm super happy with it. It has pretty much no padding~ but makes up for it by having a super wide belt and leg loops.  I was a little skeptical because the MM Cadillac and BD Big Gun looked like they had so much more padding~ but I read reviews saying that the 395a was more comfortable and lighter. I haven't tried those so i can't say for sure how they compare~ but the Arc'teryx is WAY more comfy than than my old Petzl Sama~ the gear loops are enormous compared to the sama~ and it packs down small enough to fit in my helmet for the approach. If i had to do it again I would get the FL-365 because i haven't needed to adjust the leg loops at all. Even with the softest~ fluffiest padding~ you're still going to wind up with all of your weight resting on some narrow straps~ and that soft fluffy padding is going to be mostly compressed when you're hanging. The thing that makes more of a difference IMO is the width of the straps. The padding on the MM might feel stiff~ but the belt and leg loops are significantly wider than those on the corax and that's what will make the difference in comfort. With this in mind~ i feel that the Arc'teryx harness brilliantly does away with the bulky padding and leaves you with broad straps that spread the weight of your hanging body over a larger area without saddling you with an extra quarter pound of foam.,May 2018,Jul 23 2019,5
2385,TRAD harness recommendation,2,3, ^ exactly. The width of the thin/low-profile FL-365 makes it incredibly comfy~ yet low bulk with huge gear loops.,Aug 2014,Jul 23 2019,5
2386,TRAD harness recommendation,2,4, the arcteryx also does a lot really well. sport climbing~ strip it down. trad~ load it up. ice climbing~ it's got clipper slots in the right spots~ doesn't soak like a padded one would.,Sep 2016,Jul 23 2019,2
2387,TRAD harness recommendation,2,5, Try a bunch of harnesses on~ buy the one that fits~ and has the features you want~ and none of the features you don't want. ,Jul 2015,Jul 23 2019,1
2388,TRAD harness recommendation,2,6, I’m a Misty Mountain guy for life. But I’ve climbed in a lot of Arc’Teryx harnesses and they are legit. Super comfy and light weight. If I ever stray from my beloved Cadillac and Turbo~ it will be for deadbird. And I hate to say it~ but the BD harness that will be available in January looks amazing. Don’t think they’re gonna bring out a fully featured trad one right away~ but there will be one down the line.,May 2009,Jul 23 2019,0
2389,TRAD harness recommendation,2,7, Dmm Renegade 2.. ,Mar 2018,Jul 23 2019,0
2390,TRAD harness recommendation,2,8, Arcteryx AR395a (adjustable leg loops).  Padding is overrated~ you need to properly spread the load over a large area without it folding over.  Arc'teryx has mastered this~ no bulk~ no extra weight~ no padding to pick up moisture and prevent ventilation. Black Diamond gear loops are often too narrow to hold a double rack without piggy backing pieces on each other.,Nov 2006,Jul 23 2019,1
2391,TRAD harness recommendation,2,9, I have the Petzl Adjama and DMM Renegade 2.  I prefer the Renegade of the two for my trad climbing but for what you're describing (maximum comfort) you might look at something like the BD Big Gun.  It's quite tall (large surface area) and reasonably padded. ,Jun 2016,Jul 23 2019,1
2392,TRAD harness recommendation,2,10, I really like my Petzl Adjama. The new one has a 5th gear loop on the back and it works wonders. Of course I only had 4 loops prior to this harness so anything is a step up. It's reasonably comfy at belays and handles my trad rack just fine.  As other people have said~ I've also heard good things about the MM Cadilac~ but I've never used it. ,Mar 2015,Jul 23 2019,0
2393,TRAD harness recommendation,2,11, So be able to try them on is the rub. I'm in San Diego. We got REI and Adventure 16. They aren't carrying these harnesses to try on~ hence my posting this and seeking the wisdom from the collective dirtbag community. BTW~ thank you all for the responses. I've been in Nomads my last two Tahquitz trips but was after cams and biners so I didn't look to see if they had any of the harnesses mentioned in this thread. I'll check this weekend. I loaded the MM Caddy today with a double rack. It was comfortable enough despite what felt like overly stiff padding. It seemed to sag a bit. Yes~ I've read the comments that they all sag. I'm speaking in relative terms. The belt being wider then my Petzyl~ I was expecting less sag. I pulled it up and gave another tug and cinched it down a bit tighter and it seemed a bit better. I guess the jury is still out. I need to play with my rack arrangement and its loops. My first racking didn't seem to take advantage of the gear loops... kinda of sh!# show.  Lastly~ I didn't think it would be a thing but my first wife's name was Misty and seeing that name prominently displayed keeps stirring up old memories~ some good~ some bad. I might have to bail on the caddy for that reason alone. :) So........ I thank you all again for the feedback. It's really helping to make an educated decision in choosing an upgrade. I'll be sure to pass along the golden nuggets to others as well.,Jun 2019,Jul 23 2019,1
2394,TRAD harness recommendation,2,12, Another vote for a 395a.     I have not used the new adjama~ but the old one is the worst harness I have ever used.,Jan 2016,Jul 24 2019,1
2395,TRAD harness recommendation,2,13, So I actually clicked this because the snarky asshole in me wanted to say “any harness is a trad hardness...” apologies But at risking thread drift: AFAIK~ the latest update to Petzl Corax removed the ice clipper slots. Any long time Corax users who have been satisfied with that model~ need clipper slots~ and found an acceptable alternative? Might be moot because I’m still ~1-2 years from needing a new one. I usually replace when the protectant webbing for the lower tie in wears through.,Feb 2013,Jul 24 2019,0
2396,TRAD harness recommendation,2,14, I think the Cadillac is comfortable~ not because of the thickness of the padding~ but the because of the width of the waist portion of the harness. Your weight is distributed over a wider section of the harness~ resulting in more comfort.,Nov 2009,Jul 24 2019,0
2397,TRAD harness recommendation,2,15, Yeah~ the Adjama has the worst gear loop alignment possible.  They lay flat and are overlapping. ,Jul 2015,Jul 24 2019,1
2398,TRAD harness recommendation,2,16, As an aside~ when I want lots of rack space I climb with a grivel lynx pack.   The pack is removable  if you just want to climb with the harness for the loops.   The lower loops (on red webbing) act like a second set of loops in the harness area and I use the chest loops for hold my next cam placement if I am in a good stance and my next placement won't be (easier to reach than harness).    It also works well as I share a rack with wife so we can just switch the pack back and forth.   I hate regular gear slings and prefer harness racking.... Which the pack mimics well while adding flexibility and more loops!  The 10 ish liter pack is even set up to be able to swing around to your front  for access without taking the pack/harness off~ pretty clever design.  ,Jan 2016,Jul 24 2019,2
2399,TRAD harness recommendation,2,17, If you are swinging leads it is way easier and less of a chance of dropping gear to just have a sling over your shoulder with all the cams(fancy people buy stuff like what Nick posted). Reason is you just pull it off and pass it to the leader and they take off. Its piece of cake. Putting a bunch of cams on your harness means you risk dropping one when you are switching gear. Plus it is super annoying in OW.,Mar 2013,Jul 24 2019,1
2400,TRAD harness recommendation,2,18, Word of warning~ if you climb a lot of layback or chimney you'll tear through the front gear loops on the Adjama.  The plastic inserts are great at keeping the shape of the loops~ but provide a wear point.  I've had two friends drop a rack of cams because they wore through their loops.  The size of the middle loops are tiny (I have a small~ maybe the larges are different)~ front loops can easily carry a rack of cams each~ and the back loop is wonderful.  The desert is quite rough on gear~ but this type of failure felt excessive and unprecedented.  ,Jun 2015,Jul 24 2019,1
2401,TRAD harness recommendation,2,19, Everything is annoying in OW~ lol! ,Sep 2005,Jul 24 2019,0
2402,TRAD harness recommendation,3,0," We're on MP~ so all harness threads end up the same: ""MiStY MoUnTaIn CaDiLlAc!"" Nah~ that harness sucks; I honestly don't understand why everyone is so enamored with it. Too big and bulky~ padding holds on to sweat and stays wet all day~ it doesn't pack down as nice as others~ and 6 weirdly stacked gear loops (why are you people are adding even more?! how much shit do you take with you?!)...It's more of a lightweight wall harness.  I drank the koolaid years ago and ordered one; absolutely hated free climbing in it. Before you all get your flamethrowers out~ I'm not bagging on MM. The harness I received was well built and the customer service was fantastic. I just don't think the cadillac is good for free climbing. Something like the intrepid or maybe the sonic would probably be better. IDK~ I've never tried those so YMMV. IMO~ the arcteryx ar-XXX (the one with adjustable leg loops) is a really great free climbing/sport/trad/ice harness that's very comfortable and packs quite small. Worth the few extra bucks every 5-7 years imho. REI carries them so you can probably try it on there (or order online/return there)~ or if you're really in a gear desert~ order a few different ones from one of the big etailers and return what doesn't fit/feel right (unused w/ tags of course).",Apr 2011,Jul 25 2019,4

2415,TRAD harness recommendation,3,13, I’ve been happy with my Petzl calidris. I’ve tried the old MMC with the black fleece covering and it doesn’t breath well so it gets damp and causes raspberries. But I haven’t tried a newer one. The Calidris with it’s I frame construction is light for such a wide~ comfy harness and breathes really well. I use it for trad and big wall. Only 4 gear loops though~ The back ones are pretty big.  Tighten your harness when on as high as possible. Well above your hips.  I like a gear sling for the rack because the cleaner can hand the whole rack back to the leader all organized in one shot. I put my slings etc on my harness. I don’t like over the shoulder slings cause they can be hard to take off. ,Oct 2011,Aug 31 2019,1
2416,TRAD harness recommendation,3,14, I have a lot of money. Still doesn't justify a 'fancy' harness.

2418,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,0, Just to mitigate confusion with similarly named devices the one I will be discussing is shown below ,Dec 2012,Nov 8 2014,3
2419,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,1, I´ve tested the alpineUp back to back against a large selection of other devices and measured some of it´s parameters as well.   Feeding it takes more effort to pull the rope through than all but one other device. 2/10.   Lowering in locking mode. O.k with a heavy climber on overhanging rock otherwise rubbish or impossible. 3/10.   Rapping in locking mode-No.   Dynamic mode-the weakest belay device I´ve ever measured and about 1/2 the power of an ATC. Be good with little kids but nothing else. Rapping I didn´t bother with testing.   Top-roping in locking mode-too much effort to pull the rope through.3/10.   Braking performance- the best of this sort of device by far 8/10.   Guide mode- I never use this so no idea~ the Smart Alpine was better in our pull-through force tests but lowering appears a challenge with them all.   The only time I would possibly use this device is with my 7.8mm twin/half ropes where the braking performance is good but due to it´s size and complexity it hasn´t repaced my current device with two karabiners which gives coparable performance. In our comparison test days cragging the assisted locking devices were all left on the side after trying them and everybody went back to the usual ATC XP/Grigri combination.,Nov 2009,Nov 9 2014,0
2420,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,2,,Feb 2008,Nov 10 2014,0
2421,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,3," Ah well~ I prefer not to do reviews just testing since a lot in a review is personal taste~ they are usually of dubious value anyway. For example the review above gives lowering ""9/10 if using a proper rope. Much less if not."" which is ludicrous since I tried a lot of ""proper"" climbing ropes and couldn´t lower a substantial climber with a lot of them~ a disciple that nearly all belay devices master effortlessly. My Grigri worked every time and so did my ATC XP so where´s 9 from 10 come from?   For thin half/twin ropes it´s good~ for single ropes up to it´s maximum rating it isn´t.",Nov 2009,Nov 10 2014,0
2422,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,4,,Dec 2012,Nov 10 2014,0
2423,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,5, Reading your comments makes me wonder if we are actually talking about the same device.  (Are you using it with the supplied biner?),Jan 2006,Nov 10 2014,1
2424,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,6, I have been using the alpine up for 2 years and it is by far the best belay/rapel device I have used in 35 years of climbing.    It lead belays very well playing out rope easily and assist locks reliably~ better in my mind than A grigri.   Top rope belay is great because you can lock the line and still take up slack.   I have worried about lowering but the release lever works well.   Rapelling is very nice with the ability to go hands free at a ny time.   It does twist my rope rapelling sometimes.  Sometimes the twisting is very bad~ sometimes not at all.  I have yet to figure out what makes the difference.   I agree with the reviewer's review.  And yeah it seems pretty heavy when I am thinking I want to go light.,Feb 2006,Nov 11 2014,1
2425,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,7," ""Jim Titt wrote:   Lowering in locking mode. O.k with a heavy climber on overhanging rock otherwise rubbish or impossible. 3/10. Rapping in locking mode-No."" ""I do this all the time. Used 10+mm single ropes and 7.5mm twins~ and all kinds of diameters in between. Never had an issue. Really like the added security of the click up as it allows me to go hands free if needed to clear rope tangles and the like.""   Yup~ that´s why I keep well away from reviews of this kind generally. It´s not clear from your reply whether you are talking about lowering or rappelling but both the OP and myself found with thick ropes it was a considerable problem if not impossible.    If you are talking about rappelling then you should be aware that your thoughts on a single 10+mm rope in locking mode are irrelevant as this is forbidden by the manufacturers. ""Attention! The self-locking abseil with a single rope is not allowed"". (Quite why rapping is forbidden when one would hope belaying with a single strand will function is not clear). That there is an addendum to the instructions of how to facilitate abseiling ""when it is quite difficult"" involving adding another karabiner somewhat discouraged me from testing this aspect~ with some of my ropes it was doomed to failure anyway.",Nov 2009,Nov 11 2014,0
2426,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,8, I will try to make it very clear:   When lowering a climber (for example~ on a sport route~ where my partner has clipped the chains and I am lowering him to the ground) I have never had any problems lowering in click-up mode.  I've used a single Sterling 9.8~ single Sterling 9.4~ an Edelweiss 10.5~ and an Edelrid that I'm not entirely sure of the diameter~ but somewhere in the 9.5mm range I would guess.     No problems lowering my partner on any of these ropes.  This is true on overhanging sport routes~ and slabby trad routes.     When rappelling~ I always rappel on two ropes.  When I write about rapping on single ropes~ I mean that I am rapping on two strands of a rope that is rated as a single rope (as opposed to a half or twin rating.)  I don't meant that I am rappelling on a single strand of rope.     I've rapped on ropes from Edelrid~ Sterling~ Edelweiss~ and a couple of ropes I don't know the brands of~ in diameters from 7.5mm to 10.5mm.     Never had any issues.  Never had to resort to adding another carabiner as shown in the video.  Starting out on low angle terrain~ with a lot of rope beneath me~ I will sometimes use my non-brake hand to raise the trailing rope above the device to make feeding easier.  It's not a hassle~ however~ and I've always been able to manage a smooth and controlled descent.     I'm not sure how you could even have an opinion on the subject of rappelling if you didn't test this aspect of use yourself.     Bottom line is that I've done thousands of feet of belaying and rappelling with this device with a wide variety of rope diameters and types. I have yet to find a situation in which it did not perform well~ and in most cases~ it works better than any other device I've used.,Jan 2006,Nov 11 2014,1
2427,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,9," I have used the standard Clip-Up device quite a bit~ and found that it is picky with belay carabiners. For example~ the Metolius Gatekeeper does not allow the Click-Up to orient correctly into locked position~ and will therefore allow some rope to slip through with body weight applied. Funny considering they market it as a carabiner tailored to ""semi-automatic belay devices"".   I found the BD Gridlock to be an excellent pair with the Click-up. I'm betting these details also apply to the Alpine Up~ but would like to hear more feedback in that regard.",Apr 2002,Nov 11 2014,0

I've been yapping for years that manufacturers claim ridiculous ranges for their devices~ none of which perform well at the ends of the advertised spectrum~ suffering handing problems at the large end and friction problems at the small end.  I've suggested that the middle third of the claimed ranges is more likely to be the range for adequate performance; that would be about 8.3-9.5mm for the Alpine Up.  Of course~ that's too narrow a range for marketing purposes~ but my guess is performance will not be so good outside those narrow limits.   I've experimented with the extra carabiner CT suggests to mitigate the effect of rope weight making it hard to descend when rapping in the locking orientation.  It works and is smooth on my 8.5's~ but it introduces so much twisting in the strands that I gave up on it early on.  I don't have any rappel troubles most of the time.  If the rappel is long and overhanging~ so that I have the full weight of 60m of rope on the device~ then the rope has to be fed in for twenty or thirty feet~ at which point it works normally.,Feb 2008,Nov 11 2014,0
2431,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,13, Just my 2-cents from the field using an Alpine Up this spring/summer season on a sterling 9.2 Evolution Aero Dry~ which is a fairly soft rope.  I won't even try to score anything -- just some subjective observations from use in the local mountains during some class 4 and easy-5 alpine climbing and descents.   Belaying with a single line in dynamic mode~ it's controllable.  But I wouldn't take my eyes off the leader if there was any chance of a hard fall.  To be honest~ I'd prefer two carabiners under my ATC guide for a dynamic belay on a single strand of the Aero.     In assisted mode~ I'd want to be able to move around~ as with a Grigri.  However~ I think I slightly prefer the feel of the Alpine Up's lock-off to that of a Grigri.  I haven't tried using it from a lead.     Rappelling~ I use it in assisted mode. It's very controlable on the doubled line using the supplied carabiner.  A BD Rocklock will also work in the device~ but I think it makes the locking action somewhat more aggressive.  I haven't had any reason to try the second carabiner feed. It can be locked hands-free~ though I do always keep something else on the rope.  I could jug on it if necessary by locking-off my backup above the device.  For me~ the assisted locking during rappels is its greatest appeal.   Seems to be wearing fairly well with just the usual anodizing being rubbed off~ and the plastic handle seems fine.  Doesn't appear to impart any undue rope twist~ though the rope is getting rather fuzzy.  As mentioned at the top~ threading a rope means un-tethering the device~ which is a little disconcerting.,Jul 2015,Jul 26 2015,0
2432,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,14, Never owned one but seems to me this device is comparable to Mega Jul ...,Oct 2013,Aug 25 2015,0
2433,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,15, It is comparable only in that both are assisted locking devices.  Other than that~ it is very different~ and the substantial differences are enumerated and cataloged all over the internet if you are interested in comparing them.,Feb 2008,Aug 25 2015,1

2435,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,17, Nope. The Mega Jul is inferior to the Alpine Up for half ropes.,Feb 2008,Aug 25 2015,0
2436,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,1,18," I agree with Rgold on this one~ I bought a megajul shortly after buying a pair of bluewater 8.4s and was pretty disappointed. Despite testing it with about a dozen different lockers it provided a lot less friction than just about any other belay device I ""tested"".    It turns out that its great for a single rope though and is pretty much all I use for singles nowadays.    The microjul is a different story~ it works better than any other device I ""tested"" on the fuzzy 8.4's and feeds well enough to provide a good belay even without using the thumb loop. For the biner I've settled on the omega pacific jake~ for both the mega and micro and with a bunch of different rope diameters. It seems to consistently provide the most friction.   I wouldn't mind giving the alpine up a go but the price and weight are a bit much.   Rgold~ have you tried the micro on your doubles?",Jun 2011,Aug 25 2015,0

2442,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,3, I know this is an old thread~ but I'm looking info purchasing this device for my slippery 9mm Millet rope. Peoples opinions on it seem mixed~ but the general consensus online seems to be that it works better on thin soft rope~ but I'm curious if you guys think it would work well on a thin triple rated rope like mine.,Oct 2016,Mar 14 2017,0

2445,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,6, I just bought one today~ as my one device to rule them all. I have a couple of questions for experienced Alpine Up users.  When multipitch trad climbing / alpine climbing with trad protection~ do you use Click-Up mode~ or Dynamic? Instructions state to only use Click Up mode on bolt-protected routes~ and I understand that the assisted locking could give a harder catch / place more stress on the gear. But I feel that the advantages of the assisted braking outweigh the disadvantages in most cases~ and understand the Dynamic mode is not very strong. What have your experiences been?  When belaying a second from above~ and the anchor does not lend itself to guide mode~ what is your preferred method of bringing up the second? From harness direct to belayer~ or via redirect? In Click-up mode or Dynamic?  Any other heads-up for new user?  Thanks :-) ,Sep 2010,May 17 2017,1

In Click-up mode or Dynamic?  Any other heads-up for new user?  Thanks :-)  I use the click up mode for belaying the leader---I don't think there's enough friction in the dynamic mode for 8.5 mm ropes. I mostly belay seconds with the device clipped to the rope loop on my harness with a snug tie-in. Although the device pumps out slack really well~ you can lock it up every now and then.  The release technique is to place the heels of both hands on the bottom of the device and shove it away from your body.  This same technique is needed at the base of most rappels in order to release the device when there is still some rope tension on it from the rappel. It might be the most awkward of all the devices to thread~ and it would be a good idea to work out a protocol so that you don't drop it.  Alternatively~ you can use the hole at the base to clip the device to you with a quickdraw while you are threading it.,Feb 2008,May 17 2017,0
2447,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,8, The only time I ever use dynamic mode is if I have to use a super fat rope. I've caught plenty of whips on bolts and on gear~ and that is on chossy sandstone which will crumble under significant force. It may result in a higher impact force but~ like you~ I have determined that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages for my use. I've top belayed in all three configurations and while guide mode is my preference if the situation allows~ it works fine with a redirect or direct of the harness. I would say your decision between redirect and harness belay should be based more on the situation than the device because it works fine in either configuration. For these uses~ I don't see a reason to use dynamic mode unless~ again~ you're using a super fat rope. The only other heads up I would give is to make sure you use the belay biner that comes with it exclusively. A biner with a different width cross section could both cause it to lock up while feeding slack or~ even worse~ fail to lock up if it is too fat to travel up into the slot.,May 2014,May 17 2017,1
2448,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,9, Is the Alpine Up at all useful for single ropes? I am very happy with the Click Up for single ropes in the 9.4-9.8mm range (so far--haven't had it very long) but I think I'm going to still have to bring my DMM Pivot for rapping and guide mode~ so it would be nice to have a single device that could do both. But I've read a lot online that seems to indicate it's intended only for two ropes. Has anyone used the Alpine Up for single ropes? EDIT: The other possibility I'm considering is single-strand rapping using the Click Up~ with a system like this. I can make do without guide mode (I rarely do it anyway). I'll have to experiment a bit with the device before I decide whether I like that.,Jan 2017,May 18 2017,0

When I want a retrievable rap (so two strands) with my Grigri I just leave one end tied in my harness~ thread the rap ring/bolt/karabiner or whatever and lower myself on the other strand~ can´t see why it has to be made any more complicated.,Nov 2009,May 18 2017,1
2450,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,11, yes you can use the alpine up for single ropes. The only thing is that it may not lock up without a brake hand on single strand belay or rap.,May 2014,May 18 2017,0

If I'm understanding you correctly~ doesn't this wear down the anchor hardware just as much as having your follower lower you? The reason I would rap down in the first place is because the local ethic is to rap to preserve the anchor hardware. I almost always choose lowering over rapping when the local ethic allows it~ but then I have my follower lower me~ rather than lowering myself.

That for me is the whole reason for owning it. Although keep in mind that I've found that it does not go into lock mode with an incapacitated or poor belayer that doesn't~ or can't~ keep their hand on the brake strand during a fall. For this reason alone~ I choose to use it only for half rope lead belaying. For single rope lead belaying I prefer a different brake assisted belay device that will lock up without a hand on the brake strand. This is why the Alpine Up is not a one device to rule them all for me. I think I've used it in dynamic mode once with a leader who was using old school thick half ropes that kept unintentionally locking the device when feeding slack. After hearing what people have said about the dynamic mode not being very powerful I'm going to want to safely test that myself to see what I think before using it again.  It should work fine in any of your top belay situations~ although like Eli mentioned which one you use should be dependent on what you have to work with for your anchor and the rock formations up top. Given the choice I'd use it guide mode when ever I can. It's great! I like to setup the extra carabiner sitting cross wise over the carabiner holding the rope so I can give slack at a moments notice if called for.  David Kerkeslager wrote: Is the Alpine Up at all useful for single ropes?

Officially~ no device is fully auto-locking--no manufacturer is going to make that claim because it opens them up to liability.

2455,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,16, When I first got my AlpineUp~ I did some hands off whipper tests with knots tied below the device. It caught about 9/10 falls. The one that failed to catch was on very stiff rope. ,Apr 2012,May 18 2017,0

But there's some evidence that the Alpine Up can catch falls unattended (see here). I'd definitely want to see more tests before I'd trust it~ though. I'm pretty sure from what I read from Jim Titt's and Rgold's posts that the Grigri is certified as fully auto locking (I may not have the exact wording correct)~ and most everything else is manual brake assist. And if I remember correctly it has more to do with catching a factor two fall with no belayer input pulling the brake strand upwards. Despite this somewhat legal interpretation~ there are some devices like the Mammut Alpine Smart Belay~ Edelrid Megajul~ and Grigri that I'd much rather have being used to belay me in the scenario of an incapacitated belayer that can't hold the brake strand~ or an unattended brake strand from poor belay technique. It's not perfect mind you~ but I know in most circumstances from the experience of using them that they will lock on their own even if the belayer can't or is not holding the brake strand. Both myself and Rgold have tested the brake assist feature on the Alpine Up in the scenario of an un-attended belayer without a hand on the brake strand. I did it in a gym on lead taking a fall slightly above the second clip with a thick bouldering pad below me. I used single ropes of different thicknesses and tested it several times with each rope. Each time I decked onto the pad with the Alpine Up. Doing this same test with a Grigri 1 and 2~ Alpine Smart Belay~ and Megajul I was caught each time. I believe Rgold did his tests with his half ropes~ but I'll let him speak for himself about that.  I have a suspicion that it may auto lock without a hand on the brake strand with half ropes right near it's 9mm max half rope size~ or with two single ropes of the same size or larger. My observation of rappelling with my 9.2mm single rope is~ that if you take it out of lock mode it will go right back into lock mode if you put weight on it without a hand or any resistance on the brake strand. I discovered this on a traverse I had to make to the next rappel anchor as I walked over to it on the ledge I landed on keeping my brake hand really loose on the brake strand. I've also used the Alpine Up with a climbing partner's old school half ropes that is as he claims as close to 9mm as he could buy at the time. Part way up the climb I had to have him temporarily anchor himself so I could switch to dynamic mode belaying on the Alpine Up as it kept going into lock mode while feeding slack and shorting him. Don't though take this second paragraph as completely tested stuff~ because I haven't taken the time to really test these scenarios to see when it does and doesn't happen.  The video you posted doesn't tell us what diameter the ropes they are using are. From what I can make of the foreign language~ all they tell us is that it is an 8m fall with 70kg of weight and they figure it is a fall factor of 0.8. If they are thicker ropes~ then I could see this potentially working reliably. Although you wouldn't enjoy lead belaying in brake assisted mode with these ropes as it would probably constantly go into lock mode as you feed slack. I also question the positioning of the Alpine Up in that video. It might be a lot different hanging off a persons harness than the anchor setup they use. If you have a friend or someone in a local gym who owns one~ ask them about it and even see if you can try it out before you buy. There is no one brake assisted belay device that does it all really well. In my own experience they all seem to have trade offs where one device does one thing better or worse than another. So you have to figure out what you want to do with it and what you are expecting out of it to match it up to the use case.  ,unknown,May 18 2017,1
2457,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,2,18, If I'm understanding you correctly~ doesn't this wear down the anchor hardware just as much as having your follower lower you? When you lower yourself~ tension on each strand of the rope is only half (roughly) of your bodyweight. When your belayer lowers you~ the tension on each strand of the rope is your full bodyweight. So lowering yourself place more wear on the hardware than rappelling~ but not as much as getting lowered by your belayer. ,Oct 2014,May 18 2017,0

I don't mind if others do it either.  That make sense~ but if lowering is acceptable I find it easier to have my belayer do it~ so I don't see a case where I'd use the self-lowering method.

I was thinking of this as being the same as having your belayer lower you~ but it's not. Given this is somewhere between lowering and a two-strand rappel~ I don't think I've ever come across a local community opinion on this case. Some local ethics prohibit the belayer lowering~ but given this is kinder to the hardware~ it might be okay. That said~ I've been told that the AMGA now recommends belayer lowering~ and as more crags adopt this recommendation this would become a moot point.,Jan 2017,May 18 2017,0

2465,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,3,6," Thanks all for the responses~ interesting and useful. My partner and I tried it out in the gym last night - much to the consternation of the gym staff~ who had never heard of it and were therefore unable to ""certify"" us safe in its use! I ended up demonstrating it to them~ they checked it out on the internet~ then they watched us using it and certified us - so  I'm now a certified safe user :-)  I was using my gym rope~ a somewhat elderly and stiff (like its owner?!) 10mm single~ which is not really its intended use~ but wanted to get a feeling for it in a relatively safe environment. The rope is probably at the upper end of its usable range~ and it wasn't a great experience. Feeding the device is a bit finicky~ but easy enough. On the first climb~ we both short roped each other several times~ and while we got better at it over the night~ we could only avoid locking it up on quick clips by having a little extra slack out and being very smooth with feeding rope. Locking up on falls was immaculate~ works very well. Found it quite hard to unlock~ with some practise could sometimes unlock with one hand~ but sometimes had to use two~ and had to take care to keep maintaining the brake hand while unlocking with two hands. Lowering was easy~ no strain  very controlled~ but a little slow~ especially when there was a lot of friction on the rope. Feeding and taking back the rope was completely natural to an ATC user~ and I realised that I probably locked up the ATC involuntarily on feeding as often as with this~ but didn't notice it really because the ATC is so easy to unbind. After lowering a climber~ we struggled to unlock the device to feed more slack / un-thread the device - having the lowered climber go all the way to sitting position then standing up to un-weight the rope helped.~  Overall~ all worked as advertised~ but all felt a little clunky~ probably because I'm working with a rope at the upper end of its range. I bought it for outdoor use~ where I lead on skinny singles (9.4) and half-ropes. Now that I have a feel for it~ I'm looking forward to using it in this application.",Sep 2010,May 18 2017,0
2466,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,3,7, Alex~  Yeah~ thicker 10mm and up and stiffer ropes are an issue with the Alpine Up and do not make it a joy to use. The only exception being if the thicker rope is not stiff it can be acceptable but not great. You'll find it works much easier with thinner and more pliable ropes. The technique I use for unlocking the device is different than what Climbing Technology shows you to do with one hand that doesn't work for me. With the brake hand firmly gripping the brake strand near the Alpine Up~ place the edge of the palm of that hand near your wrist on the back side of it~ and the other hand the edge of the palm goes on the front side. This allows you to pinch the Alpine Up between your two hands and push it away from you to unlock it.  If your coming from having used only ATC's for years...  I find that a lot of these brake assisted belay devices require the flaked rope to be right in front of the belayer. Otherwise the friction of the rope dragging across the carpet of the gym~ or ground outside~ if the pile is off to the side or behind you~ makes it really challenging to feed slack. And in the case of the Alpine Up may encourage it to lock up unintentionally if you are not purposefully feeding the brake strand into the device as you pull slack on the other hand. ,unknown,May 19 2017,0

It worked great anyway~ but the rope was dry treated and basically brand new.  Last I heard~ one of these is coming my way for Mother's day. That fat rope is all I personally have now~ so we'll see. One of my partners has a slick~ skinny~ alpine rope~ so it can get both ends tested. One of the things I like about the device is how it holds in my small hands.

2468,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,3,9, I forgot to mention in any of these Alpine Up threads~ when I tried it out at the gym~ I was using a very fat rope (10.2?). It worked great anyway~ but the rope was dry treated and basically brand new.  Last I heard~ one of these is coming my way for Mother's day. That fat rope is all I personally have now~ so we'll see. One of my partners has a slick~ skinny~ alpine rope~ so it can get both ends tested. One of the things I like about the device is how it holds in my small hands.

Working the device with your palm leaves your fingers for rope management. Best~ OLH Wasn't mother's day last sunday? FWIW~ I've never had an issue with feeding rope with fat ropes. The extra friction certainly makes it more physical work and demands less sloppy technique but I've never had it lock up while I was feeding slack~ even with a stiff old fat 10.5mm rope. The issue I've experienced with fat ropes is that lowering the climber with super fat ropes requires you to actually pull the rope through the device. When the ropes are fat enough~ just pulling the lever down all the way isn't enough so you pull the climber's strand up~ which is very tiring. On the other hand~ I don't think it is fair to fault the alpine up specifically for its issues with super fat ropes because every single assisted braking device on the market is also going to suck with those ropes. At that point your only option for smooth feeding is an ATC style device or stitch plate.,May 2014,May 19 2017,0

It should work fine with your rope at least for now. When it gets old~ stiff~ and fat it will become more of a hassle to use with the Up~ but that'll also teach you not to use sloppy technique~ which IMO isn't really a bad thing. It may suck while lowering~ though~ but that can be remedied to some extent by using a heavier partner as well as doing steeper climbs. Another option is to just use the dynamic mode which functions like a tuber. I've read (but my experiences doesn't support this) that you don't get a lot of friction with the dynamic mode~ but in this scenario you're using a thick rope so you should be fine friction wise.  With such thick ropes and assisted braking devices~ you essentially can choose between it feeding well while your climber is climbing (alpine up)~ it feeding well while your climber is getting lowered (camming style devices)~ or sucking at both (alpine smart~ mega jul). ,May 2014,May 19 2017,0

2473,Climbing Technologies Alpine Up Review,3,14, I just bought my third Alpine Up to loan to beginners.  The second was given as a present to my regular climbing partner.   I believe the alpine up to have the best balance of features and function for the type of climbing I most commonly do (multipitch trad). My ropes are a mammut serenity 8.9 (single/double/twin)~ a pair of mammut 8.0 twins/doubles and rarely a edelrid 9.5.  I use the guide mode which works well enough with the skinnier ropes and a little unpleasant with the 9.5.  In general the Alpine Up works better on the thinner ropes. My first one is about 5 years old and I love it although it goes through belay carabiners other than the supplied one pretty quickly and replacements for the supplied one are not readily available.  It turns out the Edelrid Bruce steel locking carabiner has a very similar shape and being made of steel does not show any wear after a couple of years.   The bruce is engineered to be reasonably light for a steel carabiner (134 grams) but heavier that the original (77 grams).  I see https://www.trekkinn.com/outdoor-mountain/climbing-technology-concept-sgl/136337429/p is now carrying them.,Feb 2006,May 20 2017,0

Lowering we found difficult in high-friction circumstances as we found it impossible to remove enough friction (and in fact swapped to a GriGri just to get the climber down)~ not being able to abseil meanigfully wasn´t cool and the value for money once you start buying a new karabiner every year or so is terrible but then that´s the case with all of this type.

2505,La Sportiva Katana Lace vs. Kataki vs. Genius,1,1, The difference in performance is negligible. The difference in fit is not. Try them on.  Mal,Jan 2001,Aug 25 2019,2
2506,La Sportiva Katana Lace vs. Kataki vs. Genius,1,2," if you want it for slab~ the Katana lace is the only choice out of those three. The last on a sportiva shoe has a number associated with it~ the higher the number~ the more asymmetric and down turned the shoe. Genius is PD 85 and designed for competition climbing which is anything but slab. Kataki says ""steep edging"" in the description~ again not slab and has a last of PD75. I have the Otaki which is the velcro version and unless its vertical or steeper~ they crush my feet. Katana lace is relatively flat lasted at PD55 and has a small stiffener under the big toe. ",Apr 2011,Aug 25 2019,1
2507,La Sportiva Katana Lace vs. Kataki vs. Genius,1,3, Sam the last numbers of sportiva are deceptive~ at least the way we think of them. The kataki actually has a lower volume toe box than the katana lace~ kataki does not knuckle up your big toe at all. From the side brand new the kataki looks more downturned~ but it’s really just a long camber from a higher arch.  Their description of the kataki is pretty off on the steep edging too. It’s great on thinner vertical to slab edging~ but steep edging they’re no testarossa.  Men’s version with xs edge would be a good candidate for thin edging. The women’s with grip is great if you’re doing more smearing/smedging. I have both for different types of rock. The katana lace is also a good choice for thin edging. With the full length rubber sole they give a little more support~ but they also don’t smear as easily as the men’s kataki.  Fit is also different~ kataki is narrower and has a LOT more rand tension on the Achilles.  Genius can work great on smedging type rock like grit and sandstone. Wouldn’t want it on true thin edging,Jan 2015,Aug 25 2019,3
2508,Two way radios,1,0, I've been thinking about getting a good two way radio for either assisting communication with my partner between long pitches or between two different parties. Do any of you find radios useful while climbing and what do you think I should consider when buying one for this purpose. I'm wondering if a low end radio should be good enough or if it's worth it to buy one with a few more features or more power. I definitely want one that's waterproof but don't need a lot of bells and whistles necessarily. I don't have much experience with radios outside of the military so let me know what you've used and how it worked out for you. Thanks,Aug 2016,Sep 27 2017,0
2509,Two way radios,1,1," For the type of climbing i like to do (rock/snow/ice)~ slightly heavier and not-low-end models are most effective. Specifically~ these are my priorities for my type of climbing: completely weather-sealed~ long-term resistant to breaking while banging against rock~ having a physical knob for power and volume (useful for gloves and frequent volume changes or power-offs)~ high power output (rock blocks radio very quickly~ we rarely climb line-of-sight)~ long battery life~ NOAA forecast~ and having a strong attachment point for a lanyard/biner/etc. I've shifted to accepting ~2-3oz more weight penalty per radio~ in exchange for higher performance and longer life. I used to go for ultra light and low cost~ but that led to almost no objective being met: they're crappy in transmit power (no point of having radios if they are unable to connect)~ break more easily~ and are more cumbersome to use. The above criteria has gradually converged me to the Motorola ""rugged"" series. This pair of radios has held up the best out of the ~6 pairs (of other radio brands/types/styles) used over the past ~10 years. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072LAAA0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 So this could be one option for your consideration. There are probably other/better ones too depending on your objective (and also for mine)~ and I'll when these die/break i'll research newer/better ones...",Jan 2017,Sep 27 2017,2
2510,Two way radios,1,2, high power output (rock blocks radio very quickly~ we rarely climb line-of-sight) So I did use radios on one climb and we had a lot of trouble with them do to not having line of sight. We basically stopped using them halfway through because they were mostly worthless. I don't recall the model/quality of those radios but how much trouble do you have with the higher end radios? Also do you happen to know if UHF or VHF is preferred for this purpose? I vaguely remember my comms classes from a long time ago and I don't know enough about why either is used. ,Aug 2016,Sep 27 2017,0

2512,Two way radios,1,4, I actually have good experience with 2-way radio's even without line of sight. My longest rope is 70meters and have no issues with the reception on that distance~ even if it's slightly over a corner. Not sure if the EU frequencies just works better? We do have less channels and in a some area's you get lots of other people on the same channel. So keep saying those rope commands with names. Saves so much time and gives you certainty about the rope commands. Long traverses are terrible for verbal and rope tug communication. I do have the radio's as plan C~ Plan A is yelling~ plan B tugs.,Oct 2017,Oct 2 2017,0
2513,Two way radios,1,5, i think I posted a similar response~ probably in one of the links above. But I find walkie talkies very helpful on multipitch routes. I use a cheap $40 pair from rei. They are small and I wouldn't be torn up if they broke on a climb~ as they get banged around pretty good.  Obviously they don't replace knowing how to communicate with rope tugs but having the option to have a conversation when you're a rope length away from your partner and it's windy as hell is super nice.  Also I'm a whimp and tend to only climb easier wandering routes that put a decent amount of rock between my belayer and myself and I have never had any signal issues with my very cheap walkies  ,Aug 2014,Oct 2 2017,0
2514,Two way radios,1,6, For snowmobiling in the mountains I use Midland GXT1000VP4 and have been quite happy. In the same valley they have always had reception with great range. You'll always be limited by line of sight~ but here was an extreme example.

2517,New Doar Ascenders,1,0, I am setting up a rope-walking system and when looking at ascenders~ I came across NewDoar. I've never heard of them~ they seem to sell mostly on Amazon~ and their prices are suspiciously cheap--entire ascender kits are cheaper than an ascender from other companies. But if they're the real deal it's a good deal~ and I'm more willing to take a risk because in this case the ascenders won't be used for a safety-critical application. Does anyone have any experience with this company and/or their ascenders?,Jan 2017,Aug 13 2019,1
2518,New Doar Ascenders,1,1, UIAA does not know about them. https://safety.theuiaa.org/front/front_search_certified_labels.php I know you're saying it's not safety critical (even though I don't understand~) but the UIAA search is a basic smell test for me as to whether someone's shittyshady.,Jul 2016,Aug 13 2019,5
2519,New Doar Ascenders,1,2, With my rope walking setup I'd be using the foot and knee ascenders to ascend the rope~ but when not ascending my weight would be resting on a progress capture device at my waist (which I already have). The progress capture device is a Micro Traxion~ which I've fallen on during top rope solo a lot~ so I trust it.,Jan 2017,Aug 13 2019,1
2520,New Doar Ascenders,1,3, eh~ it's just for the rope walking as you say~ so i don't see a problem. your real device is trusted~ so i'd be personally fine with that. i don't know if the convenience of rope walking for ascension is worth $70 though ;) but i already own jugs and ladders.,Sep 2016,Aug 13 2019,0
2521,New Doar Ascenders,1,4, Yeah~ I don't have jugs and ladders! So I've tried out a few other people's systems and am going with the system I like the best for what I'm trying to do.,Jan 2017,Aug 13 2019,0

2524,Tenaya Iati and Masai sizing,1,0,,Mar 2019,Aug 9 2019,3
2525,Tenaya Iati and Masai sizing,1,1, Tenaya shoes are freakin' amazing. I've tried them all on and the Tarifa is my personal favorite. Slightly different fit than the others and perfect for my foot. So I'd definitely recommend trying it against the Iati to see which fits better~ otherwise they are pretty damn close for stiffness vs sensitivity. I went 9.5 in Tarifas and it's slightly curled toes~ not at all painful~ perfect. Street shoe 10.5/11. Anasazi Pinks & Moccs in 10.5,Apr 2018,Aug 9 2019,0
2526,Tenaya Iati and Masai sizing,1,2, Two nights in the gym and the Iatis are broken in and fit like a glove. The Masai are simply too narrow at the same size. I would have to jump up to streee shoe size to be comfy so my son has absconded with them and is in love with the shoes. He’s climbing with them over his Moira’s.  As for the Iati~ I believe it’s a perfect shoe for someone with flat feet and a wide forefoot. If I was a glutton for punishment or had narrower feet I’m sure I could go 1.5 sizes down from street. But with my foot shape~ 1 size down was ideal. Overall impressions. Great shoe for those who don’t need massively downturned or super soft aggressive shoes but still need performance when jumping up in grades and the Mythos just are not cutting it.  And as I write this a number of folks have dropped the price to $125 in the states. Epic TV is still the cheapest. And it only took 5 days from France to Louisiana. Although we may get preferential shipping since we speak the same language here.,Mar 2019,Aug 13 2019,1
2527,Tenaya Iati and Masai sizing,1,3, I just picked up a pair of Ras as an all day trad shoe and I'm liking them so far. I also found the Masais to be too narrow for my feet~ so went with the Ra instead. I have a size 5 in the Iati which is amazingly comfortable for how tight they are and 6.5 in the Ra (same as I wear for street shoe size) which allows my toes to be flat. ,Apr 2015,Aug 13 2019,0
2528,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,0, My buddy and I were going Royal Arches to Crest Jewel in Yosemite this weekend. Neither of us are experienced slab climbers. 4 pitches into Crest Jewel~ we decided we just weren't having fun. It was stressful~ mildly dangerous~ and slow. I remembered we had an Escaper with us (pitches were too long for our 70m rope to rap)! Setup: Pretty easy and straightforward. There are instructions on the bag~ too. Just make sure you follow them and lace the rope properly. When the first person rapped~ we tied a knot in the tail of the Escaper to prevent it from slipping through~ with some slack to see if the rope slipped through when we didn't want it to.  Pros:  It works. It's very~ very~ very unlikely to suddenly drop you. You'd have to be continuously weighting and unweighting the rope.  It's lightweight and easy to use.  Faster than doing single-pitch raps by a long shot.  Cons:  On non-slab climbs the Escaper & rope's knot may get caught below you. That would be bad.  If you rap past your anchors and have to jug back up~ your follower needs to keep an eye on it to make sure the jugging doesn't loosen it. You have to rap off a single bolt/piece.  The escaper belongs to my friend~ but I'm going to get one now. That and some quicklinks could save my butt in the future. ,May 2016,Jul 2 2019,3
2529,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,1, Haha~ I've also bailed off that climb. 10a slab in yosemite is no joke!  I didn't see a need for an extra device though - was the only real benefit to your escape that you could go further~ faster? This wouldn't be the case on many climbs were longer rappels will lead to stuck ropes. ,Oct 2016,Jul 2 2019,0
2530,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,2, You blew it as the crux was behind you. :(,Apr 2018,Jul 2 2019,13
2531,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,3, It won't kill you but if your rappel goes over blocky terrain (isn't pure slab or vertical the whole way down) prepare to spend a lot of time tugging on it with no results~ until the point you think your arms are going to fall off and then it will finally release~ hopefully.,May 2014,Jul 2 2019,3
2532,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,4, I mean~ it did finally release. Happy I didn't go flailing down that slope~ though - I'll give you that. ,Jan 2014,Jul 2 2019,1
2533,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,5, You get to leave twice as fast. Stuck ropes are definitely a possibility~ but not much more likely than normal rapelling. You could even say that even though it's more likely to get caught~ it has half as many opportunities to do so. ,May 2016,Jul 3 2019,1

2537,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,9, It sounds like the rope touching rock is causing pinching points that doesn’t allow the Escaper to fully extend each time the rope is pulled downward.  All the stretch in the rope has to be pulled out before it can extend.  I’ve found it only takes around eight cycles of it fully extending to release.,Jun 2016,Aug 2 2019,0

2540,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,12, ... or it might.  Or~ you might kill yourself using it.   Seems to me the BE is best used as an emergency piece.  You're hanging on a releasable hitch which could be released with any bouncing action.  Also~ as others have suggested~ the hitch could be difficult to release over blocky terrain and be prone to snagging. Also~ what is the lifespan of these things?  How much wear before that dyneema wrap fails to generate adequate friction? No way would I ever carry a BE intending to use it~ even in the alpine.  There are better ways to save weight.,Oct 2010,Aug 10 2019,0
2541,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,13, With the short amount of rope that passes through it each time~ and dyneema being very chafe resistant~ as long as the stitching holds up~ it is unlikely to deteriorate and not function for a long time.,Jun 2016,Aug 10 2019,0
2542,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,14, Better ways to save the weight of an extra rope or tagline? Please enlighten us all to how you save 2-3kg by swapping out a single piece of kit. ,Oct 2015,Aug 10 2019,6
2543,Beal Escaper - It won't kill you.,1,15, Had an opportunity to use this quite a bit last month when a group of us ganged up on a wall in City of Rocks. The route was 140’ so we needed to set up  rappels each time but didn’t have enough ropes for each pair of to climb and rap. All of a sudden one of our group pulled out the Escaper he had been carrying around for a year and said~ “We should try this”. The wall had about 100’ of vertical with a low angle finishing slab and~ as usual~ lots of plates and chicken heads and even a bush~ to tangle the rope. Beal says this is a worst case scenario. The thing worked perfectly. With 2 people at the rap anchors we backed up the rig with a sling to the bolts and the second person down could watch what was going as the Escaper did its thing. The first person down did everything they could on the way down to defeat the Escaper: walked around on ledges~ climbed up a bit and dropped onto the rap lines~ swung sideways etc. The rope didn’t creep even a millimeter. The only problem was pulling it down. Because of the slab finish it took 30-40 pulls to get it down. We found the the pulls had to be very sharp jerks with clean releases. Long firm tugs didn’t work. On a steeper route later in the day~ it was perfect. 8-9 pulls did the trick.  With just a couple of caveats~ the Escaper is now part of my multi-pitch kit. It fits in the back pocket of my Mammut Pulti-Pitch Chalk Bag along with my phone and Petzl E-light. Caveat #1 - If your group is ganging up on a wall that is more than a half rope length you’ll still need two ropes to top rope with. Caveat #2 - We were worried that the Escaper would get tangled up in plates~ chickenheads and bushes. While we did get the rope stuck it wasn’t the Escaper that got stuck. It is no worse than pulling down any stuck rope. Caveat #3 - This will scare your friends. Rating: 5 Star,Jan 2001,Aug 10 2019,12

2545,PETZL Sirocco broken buckle fix,1,0," I've had a PETZL Sirocco helmet for a year and I like it a lot. But my buckle just broke during my yearly Christmas trip to Joshua Tree. Before the Sirocco I had been wearing a 1993 Joe Brown helmet. It blew a rivet~ so this Sirocco looked very attractive. It's super light~ and as long as I stuff something inside it (to protect it from crushing)~ I can pack my pack normally and it survived until last week. The buckle Petzl uses is very fragile. The plastic snap tabs are ultra small. There is a magnet inside the buckle that helps pull it closed. Unfortunately~ the magnet also attracts iron ore~ of which there is a lot in Jtree. I was constantly having to scrape and blow out the sand stuck to the magnet before it would snap. Finally~ up on the ""Heart of Darkness"" route~ one side of the buckle broke completely. I had to borrow a helmet that day. When I got back to camp I replaced the buckle with one I bought at the jtree climbing store. To get the old buckles off~ I shaved down the plastic with a razor knife until I could slide the nylon out of the old buckles. Then I prusiked on the new buckle~ extended the strap with some tubular nylon using a water knot and had a helmet again. The repair job is stronger than the original. Here are the photos:  ",Nov 2008,Jan 12 2018,0

2551,PETZL Sirocco broken buckle fix,1,6, I would like to revive this thread in an attempt to shame Petzl into eliminating the magnets from their helmet buckles.  I recently broke the buckle on my Sirocco~ for the second time. The magnets in both sides of the buckle attracted a tiny amount of grit~ despite my efforts to keep it clean. The buckle doesn’t stay shut if the slightest amount of dirt is in the way. Testing to see if it’s securely closed breaks it. A helmet that won’t stay on your head is worse than no helmet. Until the magnets are eliminated~ Petzl should make buckle replacements (of the male side) easily available at no charge. And I forgot to mention that once the buckle wouldn’t close~ repeated attempts to clean the grit from the interfaces failed. The magnets only allow displacing it temporarily.,Oct 2008,Jul 21 2019,2
2552,PETZL Sirocco broken buckle fix,1,7, A year and a half later I'm still using the buckle fix shown at the start of this thread. I still love that helmet~ lightest thing ever. I suppose I should replace the entire helmet harness~ it's looking old and sweated out. In the back of my mind I know that all the best climbers never wear helmets. None of us wear them in the gyms~ at all. So it's kind of a security blanket....sort of a teddy bear thing.  Still~ my climbing buddy Paul Bailey has been blind for 10 years now after taking a ledge fall and landing on his head without a helmet. He crushed his optic nerve. Helmets are good.

2569,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,0," I've been using a Superclip attached to a painters pole for years now. They work pretty well~ and I've been happy with how long they last. I like that it can be used to take draws down as well as put them up.The main limitation of the Superclip has little to do with the device itself. It is limited by whatever pole you attach it to. I have used both a 12' pole I got from Lowes and an 18' pole that I ordered off the Internet that actually came as a 30' pole (using all 30' is too heavy~ unsteady~ and ridiculous).  I recently got two Beta Sticks~ the Standard 12' model~ and the XL 18' model. They are awesome. First off~ I was concerned that the attachment mechanism wouldn't work with my draws:  It works great with the Wild Country Helium 2~ CAMP Photon Wire~ and CAMP Dyon. While it will work with the current CAMP Nano 22~ it doesn't hold the gate open very far~ so it's more fiddly to get it clipped. But the Superclip didn't work at all with the Nano 22. There is velcro on the back side of the head with a slot in the plastic to slot and secure a toothbrush for brushing holds. The biggest most awesome thing about it~ besides that it works~ is how compact it gets. The 18' XL model collapses to 3'10"" and it weighs 25 ounces. The 12' Standard model collapses to 2'9"" and weighs 18 ounces. It can fit into many packs without much ado. Three gripes:  1. They are more wobbly at full extension than my painter poles~ especially the long one~ though it's not enough to be a deal breaker.  2. The carabiner attachment mechanism doesn't work with all carabiners~ though I imagine it should work with most biners one would use for sport climbing. I don't see how it would work with something like a Petzl Ange.  3. I don't know how one would use the device to take a draw down. This is something I can do with the Superclip without being too clever.  Trango distributes the Compact 9' and Standard 12' models in the US~ so those are the easiest to get here. Beta Stick also makes a Technical 8'9"" model that folds like an avalanche probe~ a Large 15' model~ and my XL 18' model. But you currently have to order those from Europe. I highly recommend the Standard over the Compact as a much more useful size of the two sold in the the US. If there was a way to attach a Superclip to the pole of the Beta Stick~ it would be fantastic. I ordered my Beta Sticks from Dick's Climbing in the UK (https://www.dicksclimbing.com/products/betastick). It took 4 days to be delivered from the day I ordered.",Oct 2007,Feb 10 2018,0
2570,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,1, The beta stick is great. A partner has one and it’s more he best I’ve used. A painters pole is easier at full extension~ but the beta stick straps to the pack easier. Also shines when you have to stick clip up a route. ,Nov 2006,Feb 10 2018,0
2571,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,2," Modifying a Beta Stick for a Superclip is pretty easy - buy a painter pole extension like this: https://store.mcguckin.com/inet/storefront/store.php?mode=showproductdetail&product=64772 cut about 2.5"" from a male end and drill a hole in the bottom of it~ sized to fit the smallest segment of the BS.  Remove the head from the BS (with a hacksaw~ or drill out the rivet) and epoxy the pole extension fragment onto the BS tip:  The old BS head can be mounted in a similar way with one of the joining collars~ allowing it to be attached to the modified BS: ",Sep 2014,Feb 10 2018,10

2573,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,4, Beta sticks were ubiquitous in the UK until recently. As summarised above~ they are light and compact. The biggest down-sides are the lack of durability that comes with this~ the pole is notorious for stopping working~ and the rather fussy head design. Two alteratives:  The LACD is an avalanche probe type pole with a super clip type head. Very compact~ quite light: https://www.bergzeit.co.uk/lacd-lacd-clipstick/  The ultimate big wall cheat stick?! The Pongoose~ which has a slightly beefier pole than the Beta and unique innovative head that’s very easy to clip or unclip with. It also has a screw fitting that takes a camera or (bespoke) brush. Downsides are cost~ weight (600g v 450g for the similar size Beta)~ and that it’s only available in one length (2.85m~ 9’4”). It is clearly the best clipstick of all I have tried. I have no connection with the company.  https://www.ukclimbing.com/gear/reviews/climbing_accessories/pongoose_climber_700_3-in-1_clipstick-9846 ,Dec 2014,Feb 11 2018,0

2584,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,15, BetaStick Evo: Quickdraw Removal I have and love my BetaStick Evo but I've had very mixed success using this technique. The problem is that the biner slips the gate clicks back shut. I suspect a well-placed piece of friction tape on the side of the betastick head might help. ,Jan 2016,Sep 18 2018,0
2585,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,16, I just got the Kalias stick clip and really like it. its a bit expensive at $40 but its basically a thicker tent-pole style folding stick.  It collapses down to where I can just stick it to the side of my bag and is less than half the weight of my last clip  https://www.kailasgear.com/stick-clip-quickdraw-not-included_p2524.html  Previous setup was a pool skimming net pole and a home-made wire https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QIXV1G/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It cost $12 to make and It worked great until I started on some long approaches and wanted something a little lighter. The new kailas clip up is telescoping and about 9 for long. I bought it with the pro deal code floating around. Head is like the super clip but thinner so it’s easier to get the draw in and sometimes too easy for the draw to come out. Feels s little delicate but time will tell. ,Jun 2015,Oct 4 2018,0
2586,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,17, I was putting around a goodwill and found an extendable golf-ball retriever for $5 (like this) that actually seems pretty viable as a cheaper alternative to these products. The ball-cup holds the gate open~ and with a little tape added for friction will hold a carabiner stable. I may end up cutting a notch to hold the gate snug as well. Mine goes from 3-12 feet and weighs a few pounds~ but I bet you can find a wide variety of sizes. (Edit: A quick search revealed that I wasn't the first to find this option...),Aug 2015,Oct 25 2018,0
2587,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,18, Just got my new beta stick evo~ but it doesn't seem to work with some of my older BD quick draws.  Seems that the wire retainer piece is just a little too short to latch the quickdraw gates open.   Anybody else have this issue?  ,Mar 2006,Nov 14 2018,0
2588,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,19, The wire catch can actually slide up and down in the slot on the Evo to change the angle of the retainer. Move it UP in the slot and it should be able to reach your gates. I had a similar issue and it took me a while to figure this out. It was also with older BD straight gate draws. ,Jan 2016,Nov 14 2018,0
2589,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,1,20, Here is a pic~ I believe the wire retainer is as far up as it can go.  You can see that it hasn't quite latched yet.,Mar 2006,Nov 14 2018,0
2590,Beta Stick Stick Clip Initial Impressions,2,0, That's a fat carabiner. What is that? I also had some solid~ straight gates that it didn't like to grab. I bent the wires in a bit to just make it more grabby and it works now. ,Jan 2016,Nov 14 2018,0

2646,Trax rubber,1,4, Evol uses it.  It's pretty good~ no complaints.  It wears slowly~ and the friction is solid.  I wouldn't say it's as good as stealth or some of the other rubbers~ but you won't be super pissed if you get it.  It seems a little stiffer/harder which helps reduce the wear~ but I don't think that compromises the overall stickiness.    There's a couple threads over at RC.com about gear for rocks.  Some older ones then a more recent one how they recently (or supposedly) got certified. Note some of the info may be a bit older... rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/fo…;search_string=gear4rocks;#2017335 rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/fo…;search_string=gear4rocks;#2209870 rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/fo…;post=2302886;page=1;sb=post_latest_reply;so=ASC;mh=25;,Feb 2006,Sep 2 2010,0

2650,Trax rubber,1,8, Yosemite Bum will resole non-evolv shoes~ but it will cost a little more~ and of course they only use evolv rubber.  I think they can use different rubber if you send it in with your shoes~ but have never done this myself.   I've had good luck with them .. mostly on my gym shoes.  Living in CA their shipping doesn't seem to take all that long~ especially in the off season.,Jun 2006,Sep 2 2010,0
2651,Trax rubber,1,9, Yosemite Bum is Evolv.  They did a good job on my Pontas the last two times.  Quick turn around as well~ I'm from the East coast~ and it takes about two weeks to get them back.  Price is also very reasonable.   Just about any shop will do Evolv shoes~ but not with the trax rubber.  I was told yosemite bum is the only shop that do trax rubber~ but I don't know if that's still true or not.,Aug 2007,Sep 2 2010,1
2652,Trax rubber,1,10,,unknown,Sep 2 2010,0
2653,Trax rubber,1,11, I use YosemiteBum for my resoles~ no complaints concerning the Trax rubber~ it works just fine~ even though initially I almost switched resolers when YB didn't offer Stealth anymore.    BUT they do exceptional work~ they's resoled multiple pairs of my Moccasyms and they always look new when I get them back and fit just as well as when I sent them.   Great resoles!,Jan 2002,Apr 30 2011,1
2654,Trax rubber,1,12, Where can I purchase Trax rubber so I can resole my own shoes?,Jul 2015,Jun 21 2019,0
2655,Trax rubber,1,13, Just to get multiple takes~ I despise Trax rubber. Ask yourself a couple questions: Will I use these shoes in the gym on plastic holds?  Will I only use these as an outdoor shoe? If Yes to the first~ Trax will certainly disappoint. If Yes to the second~ you probably wont notice that much. Not sure why I've had trouble~ but Trax in the gym is an epic fail for me. C4~ Vibram Edge are excellent on plastic AND rock~ Trax is not. My experience is there is a moment of warning when C4~ and edge rubbers start to slip so you know you're coming off the wall. Trax is either on or off~ with no warning~ they just simply blow. That always made me climb worse~ not knowing if i was going to slip off a hold at any moment. Just my 2c though~ some people think it's great~ obviously.,Sep 2017,Jun 21 2019,1
2656,Trax rubber,1,14," I've gotten 6-8 resoles done with Trax rubber and have no complaints. I climb primarily outdoors but do go to the gym often enough. I like it because it seems to be a little longer lasting than some of the softer rubbers that I've tried.  Ma Ja~ harder rubbers do tend to be less forgiving if your footwork is off. This is especially true on slick plastic holds (or slicker rock). I'm not saying that it's your lack of experience~ but you may want to consider paying special attention to your precision~ which is a good thing to do regardless of rubber type. I imagine that as you progress you will notice that the type of rubber on your shoes starts to matter less and less. I see you climb in the Red. My favorite place on the planet. I miss it even though I live in a national park 10 minutes from dozens of ""classic"" multi-pitch routes. Have some fun there for me! ",Nov 2016,Jun 21 2019,0
2657,Trax rubber,1,15, I was impressed with YosemiteBum’s resole job. They replaced the whole toe cap rather than just a portion of it on my blown out Tarantulaces. I found them to be the most reasonably priced of the main resolers for shoes that need a toe cap as well. Especially when you send in 3+ pairs and get free return shipping. I plan to use them again the next time I resole,Jun 2012,Jun 21 2019,1
2658,Trax rubber,1,16, Have they reformulated Grip2 since last fall when you were saying it was the worst on plastic?,Feb 2016,Jun 21 2019,3
2659,Trax rubber,1,17, Have they reformulated Grip2 since last fall when you were saying it was the worst on plastic?,Sep 2017,Jun 21 2019,0
2660,Trax rubber,1,18, I think Trax is great on real rock and in the gym. I think this is somewhat body weight dependent but I find with Trax the rubber is stiff enough for me to edge but also pliable enough to smear when I need to (very common to have to do both of those moves on outdoor routes). This of course is I think like all rubber choices slightly body/weight dependent. I am tall/skinny and weigh about 170 so I find Trax is great for me. A good analogy is if you weigh 250 you will likely hate c4 (very soft rubber) because your body weight will basically be folding it in half every time you try to push down. As a general rule~ the more you weigh the stiffer a rubber you will want compared to a lighter climber because your weight effectively makes it softer. My rough opinion of each rubber's stiffness - furthest left is softest~ furthest right is stiffest.Soft                                       Stiff C4                                         Onyx                 XS Grip 2                    XS Edge                       Trax,Jan 2017,Jun 21 2019,0
2661,Trax rubber,1,19, I'll never say I dont need more experience~ but my technique is quite good~ I used that to cheat my way up routes and problems until my strength finally caught up. I have always paid very close attention to my feet~ I can usually get 6+ months out of a pair of my hiangles that I exclusively wear in the gym. I'm usually in 3-4 days depending if I get out 1 or 2 days on the weekend. I've just always noticed how different rubber feels~ and those two mentioned just dont work for me. Grip2 is actually as good or better than anything if you're standing on a volume or smearing on a textured wall~ but I couldn't stand on any slopey plastic holds~ and this is me swapping shoes and doing the same footwork with hiangles and having quick and easy success. Just my experience. And yeah~ the Red is my favorite style of climbing I've found so far. Still haven't tried any Limestone though~ so still not sure it's the end of my search.,Sep 2017,Jun 21 2019,0

2663,Trax rubber,2,0, What you’re describing is edge for me. It must be a body weight thing~ as someone mentioned earlier.,Sep 2017,Jun 21 2019,1
2664,Trax rubber,2,1, I guess...I’m usually between 185-200 and generally prefer C4 most of the time.  I think climbing style makes a difference too.  I love Miuras because they feel like cheating on small edges~ but I find my feet blow unexpectedly~ especially on plastic.  With Anasazis (C4) I have to generate more of the edging power from my feet but I also get more response and end up climbing better.,Jul 2014,Jun 21 2019,0
2665,Trax rubber,2,2, In my anecdotal experience~ I had a pair of shoes I exclusively wore in the gym resoled with C4 and then with Evolv's new Trax SAS and I didn't experience any difference in performance between them.  Gotta say I really love Trax SAS and XE and don't feel any need to get my shoes resoled anywhere other than Yosemite Bum~ but I only wear Evolv's so I am used to the rubber.,Jul 2016,Jun 21 2019,1

2680,BD Freewire Quickdraws,1,4, They were the cheapest draws at REI when I was starting to lead so I've got a dozen.

Unfortunately none of the above is true. After two weeks of owning the pants~ a few crag days~ and one trip the pants are falling apart. The draw string is cheap. The cinch in the ankles is cheap. The fabric is far from durable.  I have punctures in the knees~ holes in the side pokets~ and holes in the seat. Some of which began to form after the first day of use.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone climbing outdoors. They seem better suited for the gym. ",May 2017,Jun 29 2019,2
2687,Outdoor Research Quarry Pant,1,1," I agree with OP's comments completely. I've owned a pair of Quarry pants since February and they have proven to be a significant disappointment. In addition to the durability issues listed above~ I also find them to have an odd fit and limited mobility; the stretch is through the length of the pants and not very ""movement mirroring~"" as described on OR's website and the fit through the crotch is awkward - you feel like you're going to rip out the ass in the pants if you were to attempt a deep squat. I've worn my pair predominantly while route setting/bouldering on a full-featured (very rough and textured) outdoor bouldering wall. The Quarry's are definitely not a bouldering pant; high stepping and stemming in these pants feels extremely restricting. The cotton/spandex fabric shows every abrasion and scuff~ and they're not very breathable when compared to other cotton-blend pants from Black Diamond or Prana. Oh~ and they wrinkle like crazy. A silly complaint~ but I try to purchase pants I can get away with wearing into the office and climbing in after heading straight to the gym. With the Quarry pants~ you're having to fluff in the dryer two or three times or taking an iron to them if you don't want to look like a ragged mess.  If you're looking to purchase OR pants~ save some money and go with the Ferrosi pants over the Quarry. ",Jun 2019,Jul 1 2019,1
2688,Outdoor Research Quarry Pant,1,2, I have a pair of the ferrosi pants and my experience is similar to yours with the quarry pants~ especially the comment about the cut.  Both my wife and my climbing partner said the pants look like they were cut for women.  Also the pockets are too shallow to be useful.  I wear them for panting and yard work~ they are not nice enough to wear climbing.  I am very disappointed.  ,Feb 2006,Jul 1 2019,0

The back pockets no longer have a zipper which is a pretty stupid design decision. But~ the overall fit has improved - I find the updated version to fit and look a lot better than the previous version. Oh~ another odd design update: the hem drawstring is no longer a pull cord with a toggle~ it's now just a flaw elastic band that you have to knot to cinch down~ which is the same design on the Quarry pants.

2695,Five Ten Stonelands Slipper Review,1,1, I just wore through my first pair of Stonelands (laced) and I think they are pretty durable. They lasted through 7 months of mostly full time crack climbing (sandstone).    I ended up wearing holes over the pinky joint in the leather so I couldn't get them resoled....   I really like them. MOst of my issues with them had to do with the lacing~ so that's not really important to the slipper.

2704,Best womens intermediate bouldering shoe?,1,2, Ignoring the fact that your shoes are not going to improve your technique~ you need to try on shoes and see what works for you.  Anything slightly downturned fits the semi-aggressive profile~ and everyone makes something in that category.  I like 5.10 and vibram rubber~ other friends prefer other options.  Tenayas just fit for me~ while a friend can never get a pair to work for his foot.,Jun 2014,Jun 18 2019,1

2707,Best womens intermediate bouldering shoe?,1,5," That is a different issue.  Did the shoes stretch out. or did you get shoes too large to begin with that then just broke in?  Leather uppers will stretch a bit~ while synthetics don't~ so keep that in mind when you size them.  Lace-ups let you customize the feel around your foot a bit more~ while velcro closures are easier to put on and take off (generally).  I am still going to say that most companies make a decent boot~ and how it fits your foot is most important~ so there is no one ""best.""  If you have a local shop with a decent supply~ talk to them about what you don't like in your existing shoe and see what feels best on your foot.",Jun 2014,Jun 18 2019,0

2714,Metolius Resling/Rewire Service “Simply The Best”,1,6, Metolius are a fantastic group of folks. I bought a set of used Metolius cams that needed slings and they looked somewhat ugly - so the price was super low. The teeth on the cams looked good~ as if they had not been placed a lot though. Sent them into Metolius and they literally came back looking almost new. Which was a good thing as I gave them to my son for Christmas.    Not just new slings~ but Metolius cleaned them so the metal was shiny and newer looking. Big props to Metolius~ and that's correct~ (or it was then) they only resling Metolius cams. I have also used Caccia equipment llc (cacciaequipment@gmail.com) and they kicked ass.

It seems to be really hard to find places that consistently carry a reasonable selection of shoes.  They all carry the beginner shoes but that's sort of it.  Conclusion... everyone buys their shoes on the internet now?   Killer for me though might be the material.

2733,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,14, If you want to know more about the Masai . . .   Here's my two cents .,Dec 2006,Sep 11 2012,0
2734,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,15, Bought a pair of Ra's~ and without going into much detail~ they are the best shoes i've ever worn.  I was a huge anasazi velcro fan~ and love a good 5.10 heelcup~ these are more comfortable while also being tighter fitting~ than any shoe i've ever worn.  They are just right in the stiffness and downturn levels as well.  Usually working a hard route i can't wait to finish lowering before i want to take my shoes off~  these i barely notice are there.   GO Get These Shoes.,Jun 2010,Sep 27 2012,0
2735,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,16, the real problem is being able to try these on ... sure theyll ship you 2 pairs and you can send one back~ but what if neither of em fits ... or you might need a 1/2 size up or down ... things you cant do without having em in a shop ...   perhaps they can partner through zappos ...,Mar 2009,Sep 27 2012,0

2738,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,19, all killer.  I wear about a 8.5/9 in 5.10 anasazis.   What size are you going with for tenaya?  you seem to have a simialr foot size so figured id ask since ive no chance to try these on anywhere out here.,Aug 2011,Nov 6 2012,0

2740,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,0, I had a pair of Tenayas years and years ago that I picked up from the Barrabes website.    Overall it was a decent shoe (I don't think they make that model anymore) fit was similar to an old Anasazi velcro. Nothing bad to say about em just didn't fit as well as other shoes~ same reason I don't wear 5.10's.,Oct 2007,Nov 6 2012,0
2741,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,1, I keep telling myself im going to buy a pair just havent got to it yet.  Not being able to try them on anywhere has been kinda deterring me.  Really dont feel like buying the wrong size and having to deal with returns and exchanges.,Aug 2011,Nov 30 2012,0
2742,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,2, +1 for fitting like a sock and being an extremely well made shoe. If any of you are ever in Chattanooga visit Four Bridges Outdoors and try some on~ they're the only retailer I know of any where close,Feb 2012,Nov 30 2012,0

2746,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,6, I'm looking for an all day trad shoe. What size should I look at~ street size +/-? Is the Masai pretty stiff???,Oct 2006,Jan 24 2013,0
2747,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,7, Hey Sweagan - the Masai is pretty stiff and would be a good choice. Its has a relatively narrow and low volume fit. I wear a size that is pretty similar to 5.10 mocs if that helps. The Ra is another good option - i like the velcro for stretching the toes at belays (the Ra also fits my foot shape a little better),Nov 2008,Jan 30 2013,0
2748,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,8, I've been using the Ra's for a few months now and I absolutely love them!  I had been using the Muira's for several years but the Ra's are more comfortable and outperform the Muira's.  I use them for everything from long multipitch routes to single pitch projects.,Feb 2006,Jan 30 2013,1
2749,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,9, I bought some Tatankas. Will let know how they go.,Aug 2011,Jan 30 2013,0
2750,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,10, How do you guys like the heel in these?  What would you compare them to?  I find that most shoes fit me very tight on the Achilles and annoyingly loose and baggy everywhere else around my heel.  I'm particularly interested in the Masai.,May 2010,Jan 30 2013,0
2751,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,11, Hey Larry~ the heels are relatively low volume~ meaning they don't have to cut back in so aggressively at the top~ so they might be a good fit. As long as your foot isn't really wide the Masai would probably work well. Some of the online retailers will exchange until you are happy. I searched for the Masai on backcountry and found them. The BC folks have always taken good care of me with exchanges and such. But if a local dealer has them already~ that would be even better.,Nov 2008,Jan 30 2013,0
2752,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,12, Thanks~ Adam.  Anyone know of any retailers in the northeast with these or who might have them come spring?  I'd really like to try them on.,May 2010,Jan 30 2013,0

2754,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,14," My mocs are for the creek~ too~ but definitely tighter than average creek-shoes. I haven't owned many 5.10s~ so I can't speak about the conversion too well. I have a 9.5 Ra that is a good ""long-but-still-kinda-hard-route"" type comfort/performance fit~ and my Sportiva approach shoes are 11. If i wanted super comfort~ I could go to a 10~ but I prefer a tighter shoe. (for reference~ my foot will physically fit into an 8)",Nov 2008,Jan 30 2013,0
2755,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,15, I wear a a 9 in 5.10 anazasi and in the moc.     I got the masai's in a 9 and the fit is good imo.  tight but not painful with some break-in will be perfect.    I went with an 8.5 in the tatankas.    street shoe is a 10.,Aug 2011,Jan 31 2013,0
2756,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,16,,Apr 2012,Mar 2 2013,0
2757,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,17," Jason~  Based on those criteria~ I would recommend the Tenaya Ra.  Its wider than the Masai~ but still perfect for multi-pitch trad climbing.  They're a great ""all-around"" shoe~ but still perfectly capable of edging on really tiny holds.  I've worn mine all day while trad climbing with very little discomfort.",Oct 2006,Mar 3 2013,0

2762,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,2, Big news!  I just got word that Tenayas are now available for purchase at Bentgate in Golden~ CO!  If you're on the Frontrange~ this is your big chance to try them in person.   Even better news~ Tenaya is hosting two shoe demos on the Front Range.  The first will be at the Boulder Rock Club on Wednesday 3/13~ at 5pm~ and the second at Miramont in Fort Collins on Thursday 4/18  at 5pm.,Oct 2006,Mar 7 2013,0
2763,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,3, I contacted trango thru their webpage with some general questions on the masai and sizing.  I had a nice exchange going with Adam (he's the guy in the videos describing the shoes on their website) about what shoes i have right now and what size i wear in them~ what i don't like about them~ etc... If you have specific questions~ i wouldn't hesitate to contact them~ they were very helpful.   I ended up ordering a pair of Masai's~ I'm expecting them to arrive next week~ I'll post up my thoughts after i get some miles on them.,May 2010,Mar 7 2013,0

2765,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,5, I promised a review on the masai too~ but haven't been able to climb in the pair i got yet.  I've got some Achilles heel bursitis going on and can't even really get the shoes on.  The toebox is low volume~ an reminds me of the evovl Pontas: Flat~ Narrow and pointed.  The heel is low up the back~ lower on the Achilles than any other shoe I own.  The arch is high~ possibly too high as it makes the shoe sag under my heel (and hit precisely where my bursitis is),May 2010,Apr 7 2013,0

2768,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,8, I went deep water soloing in Thailand with my Tatankas and they recovered perfectly. I think they may even fit better now (could just be in my head). I love them on the southern sandstone. I really like this shoe for vertical sport routes. I wear a full size bigger in the Tatankas 42 1/2 than my Miuras 41 1/2. This shoe has proven it's durability to me and i would recommend trying them out.,Aug 2010,Apr 30 2013,0

2774,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,14, Jason~   I have really wide feet and the Ra's fit me great without pain or excess pressure.  My street shoe size is 9.5 and I am using 8.5 Ra's.  They are comfortable enough for long routes but I do tend to take them off at belays if possible.  I use the same shoe for one pitch routes that I'm projecting.,Feb 2006,May 15 2013,0
2775,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,15, well~ i figure it is about time i chip in my .02....   i bought a pair of intis several months ago.  i primarily bought them to be a comfortable pair of warmup shoes.  my 5.10 galileos are my go-to shoes for really thin edging and/or hard face climbing.  i have a pair of not-so-tight galileos for warm ups~ but they are still fairly uncomfortable.   i tried on a couple sizes of the intis at the bent gate in golden.  i bought my pair a half size larger than the tightest i could wear.  they felt pretty comfortable.  i figured i would use them for routes up to 11a or so.   first day out~ i put them on and head up a smooth 5.8 granite route.  right off the bat i was like~ whoa~ what the hell.  they were not what i was expecting.  i was sort of expecting a toyota corolla~ and they felt more like a 911.  the grip on the rock was literally almost making my feet stumble.  it was pretty wierd.  i was impressed.   so i did a few more routes and started pushing them a bit.  damn! i was really surprised.  the rubber was excellent~ with great smearing ability.  they also edged well~ despite not being super tight or super stiff.  they felt reall 'accurate' for lack of a better word(?). previously 5.12 was the domain of my galileos.  the intis have pretty much taken over.  i think i have only switched over to my galileos on a couple really heinous edging routes since i bought them.   the thing that impresses me the most is how well they perform while being so comfortable.  with my tight galileos~ i have literally 3 or 4 pitches per day in them before my toes are fried.  a lot of times i have to ice my toes that night so that i can climb the folowing day.  i have had many days with 10 to 15 pitches in my intis~ most of these days climbing a lot of routes with really demanding face climbing.   these things have completely and utterly defied my expectations.,Dec 2004,Aug 19 2013,0
2776,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,16, How is the sizing on the Masai? I'm a 10.5 street shoe~ US 9 / euro 42 in la sportiva.,Jun 2010,Sep 1 2013,0
2777,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,17, Call me a skeptic but I remain unconvinced (and in all fairness~ probably will be until I try a pair myself).    I've never found Anasazi/Galileo~ or really~ any Five Ten shoe to be particularly impressive. In the Sportiva/Scarpa camp~ I'm not a diehard fan of Katana Velcro or Vapor Lace/V. The Katana velcro isn't a bad crack jamming shoe~ but I still have a couple old pairs of Vipers that are better for that purpose (& really~ if I can comfortably foot jam a crack~ it probably isn't that hard~ so who cares how well the shoes perform?) If sized for edging~ they are like the Muira lace: they work well until the shoes are fully broken in: by then the last has softened quite a bit for hard edging. The Vapor (both lace & velcro)~ IMO~ has too much toe box volume to size somewhat comfortably & still edge well (the last~ though holds up better than Katana velcro~ also softens & looses its aggressiveness fairly quickly).   So~ who has compared the Tenaya models against the likes of TC Pro~ Katana Lace~ Muira Velcro~ Solution~ Boostic~ Instinct VS~ Mago? It's not that I don't climb in other shoes~ but these are about the only models I'm willing to pay top dollars for. And without a way of getting the Tenaya models for more than 20% off + tax (problem of a small distribution network)~ they need to be on par or better than these Sportiva/Scarpa models for me to consider trying.,Jul 2006,Sep 1 2013,0

2779,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,3,19, How does the Ra~ Inti~ Masai compare to Katana Lace and Vapor V (I have both)?  To me~ the Vapor V is a little less precise than the Katana Lace.  Other than that I found them somewhat similar in fit~ feel~ stiffness~ and performance.  Of course~ right now my KL with C4 sticks to everything a bit better than my VV with Mystique~ and softer too.  It was a closer match when the VV had XS Grip 2.,Oct 2009,Sep 2 2013,0
2780,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,0, the inti is kind of hard to describe.  when you try it on in the store~ it doesn't have that slightly downturned dagger sort of feel to it.  it really just feels like an ordinary comfortable shoe.  i think that is one of the reasons i was so surprised with how well it climbs.,Dec 2004,Sep 3 2013,0
2781,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,1, Not so easy for me try a pair out in the store here on the East Coast. For a test drive~ I will have to order a pair online.  That is why I am asking before parting with $100.  Is this so unreasonable?     How about a shoe demo out East~ Monomaniac?,Oct 2009,Sep 3 2013,0

2785,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,5," Hmm~ I'm not sure I'd call these a Spanish delicacy. Clearly I have had a different experience than most here so I figured I would post up my thoughts   For reference I almost exclusively sport climb on limestone~ my current go to shoe is the Miura VS~ and I also use sportiva Cobras and Miura lace-ups   I bought a pair of Inti's last fall after trying them on in the store and thinking they were very comfortable for how snug they were. I wanted the Ra's (because of the cooler colors)~ but they were out and the salesman said the Inti was the slightly more narrow version which probably would fit my foot better anyway. Since then they have gone from my primary shoe~ to a warm-up shoe~ to a gym-only shoe~ to an ""in the gearbox at home"" shoe. I have tried them on vertical techy routes and very steep routes of different styles and found them to perform poorly on all.    Part of the issue is that I think the shape of the shoe and the focal point of pressure are quite different from the sportivas. It's hard to explain but I felt like the toe was more toward the center~ and when I weighted the foot I had the feeling that it was rolling out of the placement.    They are much softer than expected~ so I was never as confident standing on small edges as in the miuras. They didn't feel as sensitive or as sticky as cobras. Worst was steep face climbing where I felt I might as well just campus because I had no confidence toeing-in on pockets or edges.    Having said that~ I am interested in seeing how their new model performs. In the mean time I will be sticking to my sportivas",Jun 2008,Sep 5 2013,0
2786,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,6, slim~ I feel like you keep getting in the crossfire between killis & me. I knew killis was responding to me even before he explicitly called me out & I over-sprayed w/ my words when replying in a bad mood.   Unless the shoes fits you better than anything else~ I don't believe a plain climbing shoe design would work magic; maybe there's something more subtle going on than meets the eye (ex: Katana lace looks less aggressive than Miura lace out of the box but retains its shape much better). Regardless~ I'll go try on a pair when I'm back in the front range~ just out of curiosity than anything else.    As with the whole rubber thing~ I'm mostly in agreement w/ your observation (although comparing rubber on different shoes are problematic & rubber that seems good on a brand new pair of shoes may quickly prove to be too soft once the sole gets softer). As for Edge~ I couldn't wait for the rubber to wear off on my Katana lace to resole w/ Onyx. All else were not equal~ but I can definitely tell the difference between my 2 Moonlight trips 4 months apart. Still~ I do know a few people who like the Edge better & if you have to climb on warm/hot rock~ I do believe it edges significantly better than Onyx. My experience w the old Grip was that chunks of it likes to come off @ Vedauwoo whereas the similarly soft C4 would leave more of a smeary mess. But then I sent my hardest on a new pair~ old stock Mago with the Grip rubber.,Jul 2006,Sep 5 2013,0

2789,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,9, Hey guys!   I was fortunate enough to demo a pair of the Ra's this weekend at the AAC Cragging Classic in North Conway~ NH. I spent the better part of the morning and afternoon testing them out on NH granite from the slabs on Whitehorse to some of the steeper routes here in the valley. I found them to be pretty comfortable..a bit narrower in the toebox as I am used to the Scarpa instincts (plenty of room for my wide forefoot and narrow ankle. I did feel a bit of a pressure point in the heel after the third or fourth pitch on Whitehorse..however..hanging belays on slab will tend to do this. This is where the beauty of the Velcro strap comes into play. A quick pull of the tabs and the shoes loosened and problem solved. They performed quite well on the slabs~ I am a fan of xs grip rubber and found it to be more than sufficient on the bulletproof granite we have here in northern New Hampshire. The shoes are quite a bit softer than the Anasazi VS and so I was a bit leary to switch to both inside and outside edges on steeper terrain as they felt a bit more like a slipper. That being said~ they held an edge quite nicely but did lack the support that a stiffer shoe like the miura vs or Katana. I did not send these into cracks or pockets so can't report back on that. I was able to stick them into small shallow seems and stemmed quite a bit experiencing no slippage or lack of purchase. No question the design forces the weight over the big toe...and this is immediately noticeable the second you slip these on. Padded tongue is comfortable~ they don't breathe particularly well and I wish the hell came up a bit higher over the heel bone. All said and done I didn't feel that these are world changers necessarily~but...they did everything that they are designed to do and did them well. They were very comfortable and very precise on the thinnest of edges and performed nicely on slab at all angles. I am buying a pair to replace the Anasazi VCS's and will report back once I have had them for a season. Ultimately~ i am Very impressed with this shoe..kind of harkens back to the old Boreal Vector days...,Jun 2008,Sep 16 2013,0

2792,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,12, I have a pair of Maisai's.  I bought them because they fit MY foot nice and snug - no dead or pressure spots - and all day comfort.  I wasn't looking for a specialists shoe.  They climb like climbing shoes - rubber is the same as everyone else pretty much.  I'm not a 5.15 hard man - and for me fit is king.  I wanted these for long~ all day~ multi pitch routes and for that they are great.  That said they also worked just fine on a couple sport routes right at my limit on thin edges - which for a comfort fit shoe is pretty solid.  My feet don't hurt in them after 7 or 8 pitch routes - they climb just fine - what else do you want in a climbing shoe?  A good climber will climb well in a Tenaya and a bad climber will not - pretty simple.,Jan 2013,Sep 29 2013,0

Talked to the guy on the phone and had them send two pair with the ability to return one pair - they were great to work with and zero hassles with the order or the return.  Will they fit your wide foot - there's really only one way to know and that's to actually try them on.  I have a fairly wide forefoot and narrowish heel and they fit fine.  A little bite in the heel the first couple pitches but then fine.  Call Trango - talk about sizing for what you want - the guy I talked to knew how they fit compared to my Muiras etc and sent me two sizes to try.  I'm real happy with them. I think I'd go with a little bit larger size than a Muira.,Jan 2013,Oct 2 2013,0
2795,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,15, Short review:   They perform and comfortable well out of the box. Teneya Ra smells bad~ remind me of Evolv shoes.

2798,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,18," quick review of the tatankas....  i bought a snug pair~ they felt absolutely great on my feet. very comfortable despite how snug they were.     then i climbed in them.  can't use them.  they have absolutely no torsional stiffness.  even on medium sized edges~ the inside edge of the toe would start bending upward.  after 1 pitch~ when i took them off the toes were absolutely deformed like a pair of curled toe wooden dutch boy shoes.  it was crazy.  my wife totally laughed when she saw them.  i literally had to bend the toes back down to their original position.   also~ while this was happening~ the outer edge of the shoe started rotating around my foot and pulled my pinky toe underneath my ring toe.  this was somewhat painful~ and obviously didn't bolster my confidence.  when smearing they were constantly creeping off the holds.  they literally felt like i was trying to stand on a bowling ball covered in vasaline.   another observation (that somebody above mentioned) is that the shoe is too symetric laterally.  this brings the point of the shoe too much to the center~ and when you place your toes on a hold~ it feels like the ball of your foot is getting in the way.  it is really weird~ and really compromises the edging power.  maybe this would be helpful to people who have really long middle toes(???).   after really analyzing them~ here is my assessment.  i think these things died the ""death by committee"" during design.  its like one person wanted them to be an anasazi lace up.  one person wanted them to be a miura.  the last person wanted them to be a mythos.  as such~ they don't do anything very well.  honestly~ they climb like a pair of floppy beginner shoes.  an expensive pair of floppy beginner shoes.  climbing magazine recently gave these things the 2 thumbs up~ but i couldn't disagree more.   its kind of like the designers don't understand how a lineup of shoes should operate.  slippers should be the softest.  there should be a few options for velcro ranging from soft to fairly stiff and varying in agressiveness.  there should be maybe 2 pairs of laceups - a really agressive pair and a super stiff pair.  a laceup should be that last resort~ where you need to get midieval and lay the hurt to the footholds.",Dec 2004,Oct 11 2013,1
2799,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,4,19, I thought I was the only one who thinks Tatanka is too soft.   For those who love their Tenaya~ I got both of them for sale~ 9.5. Used for about 10 days each in the gym and on the rock. How about 50% off retail?,Aug 2007,Oct 11 2013,0
2800,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,0, I have a pair of Tenaya's and really like them.  They are not as comfortable as Mythos~ but are stiffer and they edge much better.  I recently had my Mythos resoled with the Onyx rubber and feel that the Tenaya's stick much better.  I would buy another pair of them for sure.,Jul 2013,Nov 5 2013,0
2801,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,1, I also have the Masais~ they are a size 14 which may be a half size too big but they still climb really well.    This weekend there was a tenaya demo at the buttermilks and I got to try the Ra and Oasi~ the 13.5 Ra fit perfectly (my true street size!) and the 11.5 Oasi fit~ so 2 full sizes smaller!!! I don't know why they can't size the shoes more consistently~ but I can say the Oasi is a very comfortable shoe still and climbs AMAZINGLY.    Tenaya needs to do better advertising~ these shoes are the most comfortable shoes that can still climb well. If I didn't have an almost new pair of solutions I would but the Oasi today.,Oct 2006,Nov 11 2013,0
2802,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,2, Any suggestions for a Tenaya style that might replace the Katanas I currently use in the gym? They are a couple of resoles beyond their lifespan already. I was thinking maybe Intis?,Nov 2007,Dec 6 2013,0
2803,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,3,,Oct 2006,Dec 6 2013,0
2804,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,4, I had a similar question. My best shoe is the Katana Lace and my gym shoe is the Vapor V tho I do put on the KL when I lead at my limit.  The other night a climber was dancing up pretty hard stuff in his Oasi.  We chatted after the fact and he said he ditched his Solutions for the Oasi in short order for the comfort of the latter~ with very little or no loss in performance.   I too have been eyeing the Inti as a comfy gym shoe but now that I know they have no downturn~ I am starting to think they are not the right shoe for the gym this winter.  Oasi is definitely pricey as a gym shoe (I paid $81 for the VV~ for instance) ... I might have to switch over to the Ra instead.,Oct 2009,Dec 6 2013,0
2805,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,5, Thanks for the suggestions!   My feet are pretty wide~ so the Ra may be my best bet. I'll try on all the slippers and see what fits best. I assume no stretch?    I wore Testarrosa's for years but they started to hurt my feet and I had to switch to something less 'challenging.'    I kind of hope I don't like the $165 Oasi. Anyone know if Bentgate has any discounts at present? Neptunes has a 25% off deal going for a few days~ which would bring down the cost of new Katanas nicely.,Nov 2007,Dec 6 2013,0

2808,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,8, I pretty much agree with Slim.  The Tenaya is a pretty narrow shoe.  Narrower than any Five Ten I've ever worn.  I have a skinny foot~ but not necessarily a narrow one.  They fit me~ but I sized them down so much that I can really only boulder in them.  If I go on any sport climbing trips next year I might buy some a half size larger~ because they are probably the best performing shoe I've owned for bouldering/sport.     I also agree with Slim that the Galileo is the best edging shoe ever.  I have two pair in two different sizes for everything from vertical wall climbing to all day trad.     I do think the Ras edge really well though.  But they do really shine in on pocketed limestone.  For a slightly downturned shoe~ they are also extremely comfortable.  If I had a full size bigger I could probably climb all day trad in them without sacrificing too much performance.,May 2009,Dec 7 2013,0

2816,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,16, Anyone have recommendations for good fits for my feet in the Solution/Instinct VS/Oasi style?   I have pretty low volume feet but street size 12~ so I can't just get a woman's shoe since they don't make them that big.  Medium width forefoot~ high arch~ but skinny heel and pretty asymmetrical toes~ so I need a decent amount of camber even in all-day shoes (e.g. Anasazis and Pontas are painful on me because they push my big toe toward the other toes).     My current sport/bouldering shoes are Geshidos and Shamans; while the width of the forefoot and camber is perfect in those~ I need to crank them down allll the way to get the air out~ and I feel that the heels fit just a bit to square/baggy.  Tenuous heel hooks are made even more so.,May 2011,Mar 4 2014,0
2817,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,17, My suggestion is to check out the Tenaya Inti~ which is made for narrow feet. Probably street or half down from street size.,Oct 2006,Mar 4 2014,0
2818,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,18, I tried on some Ras~ they fit really well but the sole felt kind of weird~ like there was a hinge point just behind the forefoot area and they bent really easily there. Felt like no support from the whole sole (no tension from the heel??). I'm having a hard time describing it well~ but very different sole flex pattern than other shoes I've worn. Currently in Katana Laces for sport. Anyone else notice that?,Aug 2007,Mar 21 2014,0
2819,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,5,19, I haven't noticed that~ but I find the Inti to be much stiffer/tighter in the same length~ so you might try those if you think the Ra is not stiff enough.,Oct 2006,Mar 21 2014,0

Size 7 Ra was SO TIGHT I could barely get my low-vol but not too narrow feet into them.  I exchanged for size 8 which feels just right walking around in my basement.

2834,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,6,14, tatankas are way different from the ras.  the ras are much stiffer~ particularly in torsion about the long axis of the foot.  for lumpy~ i would think the best tanaya shoe would be a sized up ra~ or maybe a sized up masai (for the cracks at least).,Dec 2004,Apr 25 2014,0
2835,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,6,15, Definitely go with the Masais! Great all day triad shoe that performs well in most all aspects of climbing. They edge and smear equally well and are super comfortable,Jun 2008,Apr 26 2014,0
2836,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,6,16," I picked up a pair of the Ras last week~ as I wanted a velcro shoe for the gym. Normally Miura laces are my go to~ but I wanted to branch out~ and didn't want to drop the $$$ on Miura VS. Street shoe size is usually 10~ Miura laces size is 41~ which is for sport and bouldering performance (read: very tight). I wanted the Ras to be a bit looser~ but wasn't able to try on many different sizes~ as the only retailer near me that carries them had a limited selection.   Based on the sizes I did try on~ I decided to order the Ras in 42 (US 9). They fit my foot shape quite well~ and I'm very impressed by the heels. Heel hooking has felt great so far~ and I've actually busted out some heel hooks that I don't think I would be confident in even with Miuras. I wish I had gotten the 42.5~ as they are a little tighter than I wanted for the gym~ but they're not tight enough to be uncomfortable.   It's been a long time since I've climbed in anything but Miuras. I got a pair of 5.10 Galileo's when they had that crazy sale a few months ago~ but again~ ordered those without trying on pairs first and wound up getting a size too small. The only reason I got them is because of how good for edging I'd read they were~ and I was just about to go on a trip to Red Rocks~ where I thought it might be nice to have a good edging shoe. They definitely are good for edging~ but I think being so used to Miuras has made me expect a little more sensitivity from my boot~ and I found it hard to trust small edge foot placements with Galileos because I couldn't feel them. And unless I'm doing climbs where I know the majority of feet will be edges~ with little smearing~ I don't think I would ever wear the Galileos.   To contrast against that~ I've found the Ras to be surprisingly good at edging (based on a few sessions in the gym~ albeit) without feeling like sensitivity or flexibility are sacrificed. Although I was expecting to use these just in the gym~ I will definitely keep them in the quiver for outdoor climbing in case I want a little more edging power than I get with Miura laces.   The only negative thing I've noticed is that using the outside edge of my toe/foot doesn't feel quick as balanced or centered as I'm used to. I'm wondering if this is related to the complaints a few posters have had with the design focusing power towards the middle of the foot rather than the toe (?)~ or if it's just something I have to get used to with a new shoe.   Overall~ I would definitely recommend Ras to anyone interested in a velcro shoe for those with relatively low volume feet (sup Sportiva fans!) interested in ""moderate"" sport or bouldering -- when I say moderate~ I mean not excessively slabby or insanely overhanging. For the latter~ I would probably think about the Oasi~ and I don't do enough slab climbing to really have an opinion on the former :)",Oct 2010,Apr 30 2014,1

2838,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,6,18, Just thought I'd add my experience in regard to sizing Masais. I wear a size 9 or 9.5 street shoe. After a somewhat lengthy process of returns to Trango (thanks Linda for your patience and customer service)~ I ended up with size 9.5 Masais (Euro size 42.5). They were still pretty tight with quite a bit of toe curl when new~ but after a couple of weeks they have formed to my feet and gotten fairly comfortable. I'll probably never wear them for multi-pitch routes~ but they're fine for shorter climbs.,Jan 2004,May 19 2014,0
2839,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,6,19, Hey all~ I have been using a pair of the Inti shoes for about three months now.  Being a relatively new climber. I only have one other shoe to compare them to - the La Sportiva Turantulace shoe.  The Turantulace wasn't at all a bad pick for a beginner~ but after wearing them out~ and improving my climbing ability I wanted a little bit of a step up in my shoe.  I tried on a lot of different brands and models that were really aggressive like the Shamans~ Solutions~ etc.  I wanted something in between beginner and pro~ but didn't really know what to get.  I saw the Inti's on sale on Backcountry and decided to go for it.  Awesome shoes to say the least!  I'm mostly leading single pitch sport 9's and 10's on mostly limestone and sandstone and they do the job perfectly!  I feel like my next model will be the Ra.  Definitely awesome shoes!,Sep 2013,May 24 2014,0

2842,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,7,2, I think they all fit around the same for a given size; I have the Masai in a 14.0 for all day comfy~ 13.5 Inti for sport climbing~ & 12.5 Ra for bouldering & short-hard sport.    If you like the fit of your Masai and want the Ra to fit the same then I think you should get the same size.,Oct 2006,Jun 3 2014,0
2843,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,7,3, To make things clear~ my Ra's at size 11 are pretty damned snug!! My Masais are sized comfortably for guiding and all day wear. That being said: however~ I have not compromised edging ability or performance. Pretty remarkable shoe!! The Masai's are considerably narrower so perhaps going up a half size or so isn't a bad idea.,Jun 2008,Jun 3 2014,0

2845,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,7,5," I picked up some a pair of Oasis and Masais a few weeks ago~ and I LOVE these shoes.  They totally break the performance/comfort trade-off curve~ so you can have your cake and eat it too.     I've been climbing in Five Ten Anasazis as a quiver of one for more than a year now~ and I can definitely say that the Masai does everything my Anasazis do while being much~ much more comfortable. The Oasi is a more aggressive shoe than I've ever owned but I was blown away by how comfortable it was as well as how many more footholds ""appeared"" on previously blank faces...   Sizing beta:   I am a female with wide feet (but a low volume heel) and I usually wear USW9 / Euro 40-41 street size~ and I found a Euro 40.75/USM8/USW9 in the Masai (slightly lower volume shoe than Ra or Tatanka) was perfect.     I had to size down 1/2 size in the Oasi (which happens to be recommended by the distributor) to a USM7.5/USW8.5.",Apr 2014,Jul 9 2014,0

2858,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,7,18, Looking to get a pair of shoes for semi-technical climbing~ maybe on the more comfy side for multi-pitch. Been looking at the Inti/Ra. From what I can tell the only difference is the width and possibly stiffness~ right? Any recs either way? Am I at least on the right track?   No one around here carries these things so I'm stuck ordering online (we really need more no questions asked return places that carry climbing shoes). Sizing wise is it reasonable to go with normal street shoes size with these? Currently wearing scarpa VS' which are TTS (8.5) and those are a solid (slightly aggressive) fit.,Nov 2014,Dec 10 2014,0
2859,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,7,19, I'd definitely recommend the Masais for multipitch. Unless you need the downturn of the Ra (in which case you're climbing MUCH harder multipitch than me) the masais will do really well. I'd compare them to anasazi lace-ups. As far as fit goes~ they're narrow but run pretty damn close to street size. I've done delicate face and slab in them and walked off descent routes for 10 minutes in relative comfort.,Dec 2013,Dec 10 2014,0

I also found the Ra to have less downturn than the Vapor V.  I had been hoping for about the same.  I also do not feel like the Ra is significantly more comfy than the Vapor V. Like I said~ my experience appears to run counter to others' expressed here.  Sorry.,Oct 2009,Dec 10 2014,0
2861,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,8,1, I have used the tatankas for a good part of this season climbing outdoors ( I don't use them inside) and so far I have loved them more than any shoe I have owned.

The tatankas are insanely comfortable out the box and still high performing. I will definitely be sticking with these for a while.

2875,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,8,15, Ive got a pair of oasi    Overall it fits like a pair of slightly more aggressive katana velcros for me    Its a pretty good shoe but theres 2 minor quibbles   - it uses xs grip ... On a shoe of this price and brand it should use xs grip2 ... While it generally isnt a huge deal on some polished slabs and smearing cracks (too thin to jam eve the toe tip) it squeaked like a mouse ... My xs grip2 and xs edge shoes dont generally do that   - the fancy velcro system is a gimmick ... A normal velcro strap or two would be much more durable ....

2877,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,8,17, So just grabbed a pair of intis in my street size and these are some of the better fitting shoes I've tried. But questions.   I'm not sure how much stretch I should expect. They're about where my worn in sport shoes are now (scarpa instinct vs and old scarpa vapors). I'd say they're on the comfier end of squished. A bit narrow in the front so I've got a little overlap~ but I don't hate it. I could definitely climb in these as they are without issue.   Otherwise heel is perfect~ arch is perfect.   Should I size down? Or will they essentially maintain this fit? Should I actually be worried about the horizontal toe squishing? Would ras maybe be a better choice?

2878,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,8,18, I did the same thing as you and on my second pair I went a half size down because after break in heel hooks were sloppy.  Couldn't be happier now with the downsize.  Hope this helps. If you have low volume feet~ stick with the Intis.,Jul 2011,Nov 18 2015,0

2880,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,9,0, Dude I love 'em.  I don't wear anything but Intis~ Rahs and Masais now.  Took me forever to find shoes that fit my long~ narrow~ low volume feet~ and Tenayas are it.  Great shoes~ durable~ perform well~ and comfy.,Jul 2011,Nov 18 2015,0
2881,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,9,1, Got a question for Tarifa owners on sizing.  I've got a pair of Masais (9.5 - wearable~ but just a bit too snug) and a pair of tatankas (10 - way too big).  Was thinking of getting a pair of Tarifas in a 9.5 as I've heard they fit bigger than the Masais.  Any comment on this? Sadly~ I live at the ass end of the world and trying them on isn't an option.    Cheers,Apr 2006,Nov 29 2015,0
2882,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,9,2, Anyone have time in the Iati yet? If so~ how is the stiffness and the heel? I've grown disenchanted with the Miura vs due to shitty quality and a poor fitting heel...but love how they edge. I'm hoping maybe the iati could replace the Miura?

2884,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,9,4, I have been wearing a pair of Iatis for about 4 weeks~ probably 20 days of climbing on them outside and in the gym.    For one super comfortable~ the toebox seems kinda big though but maybe because I sized the same as my old oasi's and i do think they run a bit bigger.    The lacing system is much improved over the oasi's since the grommets are  in leather and not webbing now and the velcro is one large pad vs two.    The pointy tip in the photos you see is pretty exaggerated~ mine actually kinda turn up? I have never owned or tried on a pair of muiras but these are softer for sure~ softer than my katanas. Never noticed til now but the left heel is slightly deformed.  ,Dec 2012,Dec 10 2015,0

2886,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,9,6, Im curious how the Iatis edge compared to the Tarifa? Still leaning toward the Tarifas to replace my Masais which I have loved all except the stitching on the heel which is ridiculously painful. Great performing shoe and very comfortable except for that one issue.   Scott~ I  have the Ras and totally love them as well. hold a great edge and smear pretty nicely as well. Not too aggressive in shape~ but I find they preform great on steep slab~ face and overhanging sport routes. I wont part with my Ra's!,Jun 2008,Dec 11 2015,0

2900,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,0, Update - I heard that these things were sized a bit larger so I tried going down 2.5 sizes ( I typically wear a street show size of 11 and then 11.5 for hiking boots although my measured foot size is a 10 on the left and a 9.5 on the right).   So I figured I'd try an 8.5 US mens size on the oasi and those did not fit~ couldn't get my big toe to actually lay flat in the shoe. So ended up going one size up to a 9.5 (total of 1.5 down from my standard street shoe) and those fit well with no play~ a little on the tight side but that's what you would want anyway. Took them for a spin last night and I can say these things are like the next level for being able to front point on uber small toe holds.   The shoe also has a pretty large heal rubber which makes for solid heal hooking.    The sole itself is what you would expect from vibram X rubber in terms of stickiness. The shoe is stiffer than I expected though but they haven't been broken in yet.    They are a PITA to take on and off though~ not as easy to slip in an out of as my last pair of millet rock shoes but the performance increase on these outweighs the hassle of on/off.,Jun 2015,Mar 10 2016,0
2901,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,1, Just pulled the trigger on a pair of Iatis! Looking forward to taking them for a test drive!,Jun 2008,Mar 10 2016,0
2902,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,2, I just got a pair of Tarifas. Tried on the Oasi too. And couldn't really tell much of a difference between them. I'm coming from the Sportiva Mythos. So I'm used to really comfy shoes. Tried these on and they felt really good out of the box. But after spending 4 hours climbing with them... OUCH. All of my toes have blisters on the knuckles. Maybe I sized them wrong? I dunno. I wear a 44.5 in the Mythos. And after trying on a bunch of shoes~ I've found that I'm pretty much a 44.5 across the board no matter the brand/model~ which matches my street shoe size. But the Oasi and Tarifa both left me with small dead space in the heel. My heel doesn't really fill in the pocket completely.   I tried on the Iati yesterday and they seemed to be more comfy than the Tarifa actually. But my memory might be playing tricks on me. And it seemed my heel fit a little better. Hard to say.   I might try the Iati instead. Otherwise the other shoe I might go with is the Sportiva Katana VS or Lace as a stepping stone from the Mythos into more aggressive territory.,Mar 2015,Mar 11 2016,0
2903,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,3," I've been climbing in the Tarifa for about 6 months now and they have been the best high performance edging shoe I've ever worn. This is coming from a Blanco~ Miura and Genius shoe wearer.   My street shoe is size 11 and the Tarifa fit really well in a size 9 (I consider two sizes down my ""Goldilocks"" zone). Like others commented~ there is a small pocket in the heel that is difficult to close up~ but if you really cinch down the laces you can get it near to a vacuum seal. Heel hooks are tough if you don't have the laces as tight as possible. As for edging~ I can't think of a better sport or bouldering shoe that can also work slab like a boss.   My question to you guys:   I'm looking at moving over to the Iati. Maybe it is the Tarifa with velcro? Does anyone have sizing recommendations based on what I wrote above? Also~ how was the performance with the Iati in comparison to the Tarifa?",Mar 2014,Mar 13 2016,0

2910,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,10, So I have a pretty wide~ flat forefoot...with fairly narrow heels.  Normally~ Scarpa and Five Ten are my jam.  Pulled the trigger on the Ra's and took them up a super varied route in Red Rock this weekend~ requiring decently difficult face climbing and competence in the cracks.  The Ra's excelled in this role.     In my opinion~ they have the right blend of stiffness/softness~ as well as mid-sole flex~ to be a wonderful shoe for anything from slab to gently overhanging climbing~ and seem to do fantastic on smedges and edging.  Took them out sport climbing the day before (mostly easy stuff) and the gym before that to break in~ not so great on the wildly overhung terrain~ or using the toe to pull hard on smaller holds~ but I didn't expect that from this shoe since it isn't incredibly aggressive.   I haven't seen many folks talk up the ability of this thing for varied trad climbing~ but especially on routes where performance footwear is mandatory and varied climbing is found~ they excel. Quick question though - the Oasi's don't fit me and I am looking to snag another pair of Tenaya's in the near future.  Are any of the other lasts as broad as the Ra or are they all as narrow as the Oasi?   Thanks!,Mar 2010,Apr 5 2016,0
2911,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,11, I was wondering the same thing about the Tenaya shoe line after I bought and really liked a pair of Ra's last year. I haven't used the Ra's on a lot of varied trad lines because they rub a little too much on the top of my big toe knuckle to keep them on for multi pitch.    Anyways I picked up a pair of Masai's because they are marketed as their comfortable do-everything for long multi-pitch climbing shoes (and they were on sale). I too have a wide flat foot and narrow heel. These fit me better than the Ra's and are very comfortable. The heel is similar to the Ra which isn't the best for me but I haven't found a heel that really works on my foot yet. They climb really well so far. I broke them in on easy multi pitch in Red Rock a couple weeks back. I am concerned about the laces getting trashed while jamming cracks but I guess that's why they give you an extra pair of laces.     Here are a couple pics of the bottom of the shoe. You can see the Masai isn't as in-cut in the mid sole and will let your fit lay more flat. Hope that helps. Sole of Ra and Masai  Top of Ra and Masai,May 2012,Apr 6 2016,0

2914,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,14, Huh...weird.  Everyone else seems to say that you have to downsize pretty significantly in the Masai~ lower even than Sportiva.  I almost pulled the trigger on a clearance deal but couldn't go through with it because I don't feel comfortable buying a shoe from a company that I've never tried on before.

I wear a 10.5 or 11 street shoe~ and ended up with size 12 Masai~ and still a bit tight in the toes~ though there is some heel gap now~ along with a pain point where the shoe pinches and rubs the back of my foot/ankle area.   Overall~ compared to the Mythos~ much more aggressive~ much less comfort. The usual trade-off.,Jul 2014,Jul 19 2016,0
2924,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,4, Same with me. I bought masai's in my street size and they are far too tight to wear for more than two pitches. Great shoes though!,Oct 2015,Jul 19 2016,0
2925,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,5, Tenaya Inti are my go-to shoes now.  They're comfy right out of the box~ sticky~ edge great and are pretty durable.  My size is 11.5.  However~ my 4th pair~ a pair I just ordered~ arrived and when I put them on~ they are a complete half size bigger than all the other 11.5 Intis that I've had.  Not a really big deal because 11.5 is very snug on me~ I'm just wondering if anyone else has seen this trend.  It's not that they just feel bigger~ holding one shoe up to another~ the difference is visible.,Jul 2011,Jul 25 2016,0
2926,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,6, Follow-up: I bought the Iati and it has been a stellar shoe. With the customize-able velcro strap~ I've been able to suck out almost all of the heel pocket that seems to get made in Tenaya shoes.   I wear a size 11 street shoe and bought a size 9 Iati. That lets me wear the shoes for about three boulder problems or two routes before having to take them off. I did wear them on a three pitch route but it started to hurt on the third pitch.   I think it is excellent for bouldering~ sport and face climbs. You should not use this for crack or slab.So far~ I've climbed with the Iati in the gym~ limestone and sandstone. It did well on all of those surfaces.   I vote for the Iati more than the Tarifa because the performance nearly identical~ but you can cinch the shoe down better and quickly take them on/off.,Mar 2014,Jul 25 2016,0
2927,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,7, After a few months with new inti's~ I regret ever enduring the pain of sportivas or scarpas (or shelling out all that $)   A friend had some ra's that he really liked. I'm tall and thin and have feet with a similar shape. Chose the lower volume inti's accordingly. Not only are they more comfortable~ but the fit feels better for performance than more expensive shoes. Feels like I can climb anything in these. No saggy~ sloppy heel. Can feel my toes after an hour of bouldering in the gym. Have stopped caring about that next pair of shoes.   Be careful with sizing~ they don't stretch much. Well worth the money. Will get the same pair for outdoor projecting.,Dec 2013,Nov 6 2016,0

2930,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,10, Kind of an update as it relates to the RA now that I have had mine (and used them extensively) for a year: 1. Great shoe.  The perfect blend for me between being stiff enough to edge well but also sensitive enough/soft enough to smear when need be.   2.  After time~ as with all synthetic uppers~ they get a bit slimy once your feet get sweaty.  Perhaps I have sweaty feet~ which very well may be the case~ but with that being said...anyone have any suggestions on how to de-slime the interior of these?  It starts to feel like a swamp with the shoes losing some of their stability. 3. Durable as hell.  I've been climbing a good bit of sport and tech face over the past 5 months~ and really over the past year~ with these as my go-to's.  They still do not yet need a resole and the uppers are in great shape.  Damn impressive. 4. The rubber.  I've always been a 5.10 rubber guy...complained about their shoe tech being a bit behind the curve~ but the rubber has always been phenomenal...and the shoes have always fit my hobbit feet.  The rubber on these Tenaya's is pretty damn good.  Not even mad. 5. Warts and all~ I bought a second pair for more performance-oriented outings due to the slime factor and likely will continue to be loyal to this shoe~ since nothing else fits my wide feet in the Tenaya line that I have tried (Oasi~ Tarifa~ Masai.)  These things beat the pants off of the shoe they are most comparable to~ the Anasazi VCS.,Mar 2010,Apr 9 2017,1

The ""slime"" is buildup of sweat~ dirt~ chalk~ dead skin~ etc. A good way to get rid of all that is to wash them by hand with soapy water and a rag. I wouldn't use the washing machine because they'll get beat up. After washing~ wear them until almost dry so you don't lose the forming to your foot. Washing will also get rid of the nasty little Hobbitses living in your shoes.  ",Mar 2014,Apr 27 2017,0
2932,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,1,12, I want to vent some of my frustration about the Tenaya Mundaka shoes. First of all: I LOVE the design and feel of this shoe. They are really great and improve my performance a lot. However~ after just two months~ while climbing at most twice a week~ the rubber is coming off at several places on both heels~ and on the toe patch. They are essentially falling apart with two months of medium use. This experience is reminiscent of the posts by two other contributors on this thread. I sent the shoes back to the factory~ but they rejected my warranty claim. Instead~ they offered to reimburse me for having the heel glued by a shoemaker. However~ the fact that this is happening at many places on both shoes makes me think that it's just shoddy construction. Very frustrating that I found shoes which I love~ but which fall apart so soon.,Aug 2018,Aug 16 2018,0

2952,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,12, I want to follow up with a 3 year lifetime review on my Teneya Tarifa shoes (the laced version of the Oasi)  - as with most people I do love the snugness and dexterity of the shoe and have owned them for about 3 years now - going into their 4th season right now. Having not re-soled these yet~ the left toe is starting to blow out (small hole starting right on the toe point) but that's the main rubber wear on them. The leather however~ is not as durable~ the leather around the heal quickly deformed to a wrinkly smushed in texture and de-colored to a dark glue stained brown. Meanwhile the upper leather is becoming fuzzy slowly disintegrating. In addition the upper rubber on top of the toes is starting to peel off. This material degredation started in the first year of use and has been slowly progressing.  Note: I do not use these shoes in the gym they are my outside lead only shoes so they probably get used about 50-ish days a year~ so cumulatively I would estimate they've seen about 200 days of outdoor climbing. Overall this is a pretty good lifetime for a shoe  and I think they will be ready for retirement by the end of this season (i.e. November 2019)... assuming the toe doesn't blow out completely before then. If I was using them in the gym and outside they probably would have been retired after year 2 or 2.5.  Despite these cosmetic issues with the leather and rubber glue~ the inside of the shoe is totally fine and the performance of the shoe is also fine~ I feel like they are as good now in their 4th season as they were after being broken in during their first season.  That being said I'm not going to get them re-soled because of the leather wear and damage~ and I'm not going to buy these shoes again for my next pair. Yes I've been really happy with them but not enough to buy 5 pairs and keep them as my main shoe forever. I'm going to try out some other brands and shoes and might come back to these down the road. I will say that you cannot go wrong with these and I think Tenaya is a good brand of shoe that I would buy from again.  I think Scarpa and Boreal shoes are the next brands I want to try out before giving Tenaya another shot.  Hope this helps give some more insight  Cheers!  ,Jun 2015,Apr 8 2019,1
2953,Tenaya Climbing Shoes,2,13, An update from me~ as well: My Mundaka's have been replaced as a favor by the Dutch importer. I still love the shoes~ but the toe hook rubber is peeling a bit on the new ones as well. Still~ they don't fall apart as easily as the first pair I owned. I'm torn between the incredible feel and performance of these shoes~ and their poor durability! Probably will keep buying Tenayas~ but wishing they made them sturdier.,Aug 2018,May 6 2019,0

3035,Carabiner wore out after one day of top rope?,4,15, I vaguely recall the German Mountaineering Club (or similar) did some testing on biners or (open?) shuts that were worn out by 50%. They actually performed great in pull testing because the groove kept the load in line with the spine of the biner. That is really only safe for circular cross sections. The main issue with I-beam biners is that when they do wear significantly~ they end up with a couple of sharp edges on either side that could sever the cord. This type of rope failure has happened before.  Toproping is different than belaying in the amount of load continuously applied during use. Even rappelling theoretically will result in less wear because toproping doubles the load (climber + belayer vs only rappeller). - Alex CV,Jun 2011,Apr 25 2018,0
3036,Carabiner wore out after one day of top rope?,4,16, No~ not theoretically~ rapping does result in less wear because the rope isn't moving through the biner during a rap and is unweighted when pulled.,Aug 2010,Apr 25 2018,6

3043,Carabiner wore out after one day of top rope?,5,3, Yes~ rapping wears out your belay (or rap) biner~ but at a much slower rate than the anchor biners are worn out from lowering.  As was stated above~ when lowering~ the weight on the anchor biners is higher since there is the weight of the climber on both sides of the rope (minus the loss due to friction through the biners of course).  With rapping~ there is only the weight of the rappeller~ and that weight is being supported by both strands of the rope~ so there is less wear on each point where the rope contacts the biner~ plus the wear is spread out over more surface area.,Aug 2010,Apr 25 2018,1

3047,Carabiner wore out after one day of top rope?,5,7, This is probably due to the shift from cold forging to hot forging in the past 10 years or so. I won't get too far into it~ but the basic concept is that hot forging makes carabiners less brittle AKA slightly softer~ which helps fight micro fractures (which don't really happen any more). Older carabiners were made using cold forging were a bit stronger~ but more brittle. As a result~ modern carabiners likely are slightly softer material~ which would lead to faster wear.

Or that the part you touch is still anodised so you don´t get a shock. I come from the generation with steel karabiners (and steel fig 8 descender) and have obviously been through all the various changes and can´t say I´ve ever noticed anything related to static electricity happening. A brief look at the triboelectric series tells us that both nylon and aluminium are positive and steel is considered neutral so any effect should be small but the tables aren´t very precise and don´t include stainless anyway. However in the Journal of Cosmetic Chemists you can find tests of human hair against aluminium~ steel and stainless steel~ unfortunately the order of which has the highest potential (most charged) changes depending on which way the metal is rubbed along the hair (root to tip or vice versa) so it´s anyone´s guess  ,Nov 2009,Jan 17 2019,0

Goretex came through thankfully~ i contacted them directly they were happy to look at the jacket and have it tested at their own facility~ they paid for UPS shipping and after i sent it to them i had a new Alpha FL jacket in just 2 weeks~ they actually stood by their warranty. So is the gore premium worth it? It's hard to say~ I originally bought my first goretex jacket 6 years ago the first mountain equipment tupilak delaminated in the chest but didn't leak~ it was warrantied after 4 years and they gave me a refund~ with that money i bought my alpha FL which arc refused to warranty but goretex did~ so i'm not super impressed about how well goretex products actually seem to hold up but at least they have a good warranty.,Oct 2015,May 7 2019,0

3100,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,1,3, after much investigating into a trad harness myself I settled on this... edelrid.de/en/sports/harnes…   they also have the cyrus which is the fixed leg loop version of the orion.   its super comfortable which is what I was going for as I have some back problems.  look around the net~ it has great reviews everywhere.   it is a bit stiff to start and don't expect to pack this thing down much but the comfort makes up for it.  my only complaint is it only has 4 loops and they are set back kind of far.  great to keep stuff out of your way but kind of annoying if you keep a lot on your back loops.  I kind of offset this by running some cord between the back to loops to create a fifth loop for my anchor gear.   that aside this is a great harness and I can spend all day in it no problem,Nov 2012,Jan 5 2016,2

3104,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,1,7, It really is going to depend on how you like to rack your gear.  I like to rack everything on my harness~ I don't like shouldering slings on lead - so my biggest selling point is how well i can load the harness.   For this reason~ I used to use a BD big gun harness.  I loved it for trad climbing because of the rear gear loop.  It's comfy~ but heavy and bulky in your pack.   I've since switched to the BD aspect harness~ which has a similar rear gear loop~ but is decently compact (half the space of the big gun)   That rear loop is a great place to stash stuff you don't need till the belay - lockers~ belay device~ cordolette~ etc.  Keeps the front loops open for gear and slings.,May 2010,Jan 5 2016,0

3109,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,1,12," Fit and feel are personal and I don't think recommendations will be that helpful.  For example~ I read lots of good reviews of the Edelrid Cyrus~ but when I got one~ it felt stiff and uncomfortable just walking around~ and I sent it right back.  Nonetheless~ plenty of folks like it.   Obviously~ it helps if you can go to a shop and try out the harnesses by hanging in them. (If the shop doesn't have an anchor for this~ find a shop that actually understands climbing...)   Carrying gear is a consideration~ but nowadays~ except for some specialized harnesses~ every harness has four gear loops~ and some are now adding a fifth in back.  By and large~ the carrying options are pretty uniform.   Some big-wall harnesses add extra loops.  I think most of these harnesses are excessively big and bulky for even long free routes~ but again each to his own.     Personally~ I can't stand the ""load-in-the-pants"" feeling of all the gear on the harness~ and anyway I grew up carrying gear on a sling.  I still think that's more efficient for multipitch climbing~ and you have to do it for the wyde~ so I never cared that much about huge harness carrying capacity.   My personal bugaboo is buckles on the leg loops.  I hate 'em.  If you have issues like this~ then you will typically have choices within brands~ but in some cases~ eg Metolius~ there will be no choices.",Feb 2008,Jan 6 2016,0

3118,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,2,0, Another vote here for the Misty Mountain Cadillac.  Comfy and big enough for even big walls~ definitely great for long multi-pitches with hanging belays and a ton of gear hanging off your loops~ and even small enough that you don't look like a *total* goober when you pull it out at the sport crag.,Jan 2015,Jan 7 2016,0

Stiffer~ holds gear more.   The MM has dual buckles so the belay loop is always centered nicely~ and quick-release buckles.   I'm torn~ almost wishing I didn't sell the big gun.

I like to be able to transfer from two rope solo devices (one on each loop)~ to a gri gri to rappel or lower down a bit and it's easier to do with two loops.

3145,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,3,7, A Misty Mountain Cadillac for this guy would be hilariously overkill. Like~ actually laughable. Seriously~ like 10 people think a starting trad climber needs a $120 big wall harness?   He is just getting into trad and still gym climbing~ not taking on El Cap. I started trad with the old style $35 Mammut Ophir and it was plenty sufficient despite being a pretty mediocre harness. I've even bolted a few dozen routes in it for god's sake. You guys are nuts.   OP~ if you're getting into trad get something comfortable with at least 4 gear loops. As long as you are comfortable and can carry the gear you need~ you'll be happy. Weight shouldn't even matter much since you're already carrying way more than you are used to. The 200 grams a harness difference will make is nothing.   Happy climbing.,Sep 2014,Jan 14 2016,3
3146,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,3,8, I've been using the Aspect for the past couple years:   Plus:   -Love the fifth loop.   -Screw carriers are between the gear loops (Kind of idiotic when they conflict like on the old Blizzard).   -Adjustable leg loops.   -Price~ pretty cheap.   -Comfort.   Negatives:   -My big gripe is the small BD gear loops~ I don't carry a gear sling unless I'm going into an offwidth/chimney.

3152,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,3,14, I agree fit is key. Perhaps I'm lucky but most harnesses fit ok on me. Maybe I just buy overbuilt~ over padded harneses. But even my BD Bod harness in the right situation (winter climbing~ ice and mountains) works just fine.   Anyway~ based on the function~ comfort and layout~ I really like the Misty Mountain Cadillac in the standard (non quick adjust). It doesn't feel bulky and it's super comfortable at hanging belays. I originally wanted quick adjust but ended up with a standard adjust and all of a sudden the harness creep I'd been dealing with on my Petzl harnesses disappeared. It takes a little more effort to cinch them down but set and forget makes life a lot easier.    A few caveats. I'm in between sizes on it. A large seems to be just small enough~ and thus~ I'm weary a medium would be too small. THe other issue is the large with the belt being cinched all the way to the max puts the gear loops perfectly on my sides~ while a medium puts them more posterior. I prefer the gear loops more forward than aft.   I did contact Misty about moving all the loops forward on a medium~ but decided the large was probably the right size (barely).    That stuff aside~ if you rack off your harness~ the Cadillac is one of the best. 6 loops make putting a full rack on pretty easy. And unlike my petzl calidris~ the harness stays put. No creep~ no sag.    On most multipitch routes I carry a standard rack of a single set of cams from blue alien to #3 camalot size. 1.5 sets of nuts from BD micro up to WC rock 13. a set of tricams up to the largest blue'ish one (sometimes green and grey) and 15 trad draws. Plus a cordelette~ a few small lockers~ a few extra non lockers attached to 4 foot runners and a self rescue/prusik biner with some prusik cords~ a knife and a rappel ring. All this racks with ease with plenty of room for more.    Definitely overkill for sport or even ice climbing~ but definitely the best trad harness i've used.,Dec 2009,Feb 16 2016,0
3153,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,3,15, I guess it's worth noting the a stand are rack is very different depending ing on location and this may influence  your purchase.

3161,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,4,3, Don't worry about price-even if you go with the Arcteryx at $160~ your harness will cost you so much less over its life than your shoes~ rope~ gym membership~ gas~ camping...you just don't save enough compared to what you're already investing in the experience of climbing to make it worth any sacrifice in comfort.   Try it on with your whole rack. The better retailers will take returns on brand-new climbing gear within 30 days these days~ but check before you buy since many places still don't take any climbing returns. The difference between a trad harness and a sport or entry/gym harness is that the latter will pinch or gap when your gear pulls hardest on the gear loops. A good trad harness has a hipbelt constructed to distribute the weight evenly so you just feel a bit heavier~ but don't feel one or two specific points from the harness.   I spent a lot of time choosing my harness. I only looked at models that carry XS~ so more limited. BD gear loops were too small if you want all your gear on your harness~ even on the S size. I loved the Misty Mountain Sonic~ but the leg loop material did not stand up to steep granite downclimbs/scrambling. I thought the Cadillac looked a bit overbuilt for single pitch to half-day trad climbs~ personally. I ended up with the Arcteryx~ the new blue one that is for trad and ice (R-395a I think). It's not the most comfortable to sit in~ but it never bothers me when climbing~ carries a full rack comfortably~ and as a bonus it packs down small and light for carrying.   I also agree that if your current harness is not actually at the end of its life and has 4 full size gear loops~ there's no need to buy a trad-specific harness. I climbed >5 years in some $40 Mammut harness that isn't even made anymore and loved it. Sent Yosemite 5.10 in it many times. I even shopped closeouts to replace a stolen one with the same thing because I really liked it.,Mar 2011,Feb 13 2017,0

There's more gear loop space~ and the harness doesn't fall apart (the plastic covers on the loops on the Arcteryx 395a kept coming off) and the Corax is adjustable to be very comfortable.

3178,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,5,0, Been using bd ozone with a 5 gear loop sewn on for the last 3 years now~ it's comfortable enough for a hanging belay and the 5th gear loop is great for multi pitch.

3180,What is The Best Trad Climbing Harness,5,2, For straight trad just buy the BD solution on sale for $50 and make your own rear gear loop if you want that feature.For my big wall harness~ for hauling/jugging/hanging~ this was my journey. I tried Misty Mountain Cadillac~ Yates~ BD Chaos~ BD Big Gun~ Arc’teryx~ and I found the unlikely champion at the Yosemite mountain shop~ the Edelrid Cyrus/Orion/Solaris line. Incredibly comfortable~ and I made the rear gear loop out of some cord. No offense to MIsty Mountain users but IMO they are just hype~ not really more comfortable than a chaos or solution~ and the layered gear loops hide gear~ and you shouldn’t be bringing that much gear anyway unless you are pounding pins. I think no one really knows about the Edelrid line so you don’t hear about them~ but they are innovators and a valuable addition to the sport. edelrid.de/en/sports/harnes…,Mar 2012,May 25 2019,0

3186,Evolv Oracle,1,0, The Evolv Oracle is marketed as an all around shoe.  From steeps to slabs it performs at the highest level.  My verdict: Yes it does. I actually bought a pair from REI on Thursday. I’m a 10.5 street shoe and bought a 10.  They were tight~ but weren’t uncomfortable in the slightest.  When they’re finally broken in I’m sure they’ll be phenomenal. I used them on a 5.11a yesterday.  It started with some super tricky slab moves.  Hand foot matching~ small edges~ and crimps.  The Oracles didn’t let me down.   After the slab there’s a super demanding overhang.  Hooking my feet into the Wall was a breeze and the heel hook to bump through mediocre holds stuck like glue.Only one day wearing them and I almost sent my first 5.11a! I tend to prefer shoes with a split outsole~ but have a semi stiff midsole.  The testarossas fit those criteria~ but the heel was horrible and floppy.  The oracles have taken their place.  In fact~ I’ll be getting another pair so I can send them out of state to get them Resoled.If you have a C witdth toe box (men) and a LV/normal heel these will fit like a glove.  You may want to get them in your street shoe size~ but 1/2 size down worked well for me.  They are fully synthetic so they won’t stretch~ but will conform to your foot.  Anyway~ if you have any questions feel free to drop a comment and I’ll do my best to answer them.,Jan 2019,May 25 2019,0

That being said~ I didn’t really like them much during the stretching out period~ but now that they’re stinky and loose~ they’re a great~ aggressive and sensitive shoe with tight heels.

3211,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,0," Hi all~  So I'm open to some convincing here. I'm going to Canada for some adventure. I have a BD mission 55~ a Gregory 120L ( the thing is older than me but still the most comfortable hauler I've owned)~ an osprey transporter 130 and and arcteryx 80l duffel. I will be doing ski touring~ trad and sport (leaving next week) mixed and ice climbing~ snowshoeing and snowboarding~ hiking and camping. So I need the missing link~ the mission can get pretty compressed but still is too big for actually climbing with it. Thus~ I'm looking at 2 very different options and I need your help. Option 1 $89.00 the MH multipitch 25L (2018 model) I can see that has nice features and its burly and tough and it shares one of my favourite features of my mission a side super to access main compartment ... but not a lot of info how it handles weight nor good reviews that I could find ... Also I'm 6'3 XL thus my stuff takes room  Option 2 mutant 38 (old model $110 new $170) I'm still debating if the new model or the older model (older has one aluminum support making it probably more flexible and comfortable~ for new model it has v shape two stays that could affect comfort no info I could find about it ... plus older is $60 less) So the use will be a bit of everything that the mission would be too much for ... mainly the climbing ... however I can see that the MH would be small as soon as i throw my belay parka/gloves but at the same time I can see that it may be better suited for climbing than the osprey and pretty sure I can get it into my mission ... on the other side the mutant has sooo many good reviews... Also I have broad shoulders and 23"" torso ...  Thank you in advance for any input and or suggestions. Best~",Sep 2018,Sep 30 2018,0

3214,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,3, I have the MH multipitch and its my go to pack for climbing with but it does not have a rope carry which on a small pack like this makes taking a rope up as well not very comfortable but if your partner cam carry rope and you carry rack all is good,Sep 2017,Sep 30 2018,0
3215,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,4, I like the mutant. I had the old one then the ice tool attachment broke and they sent me the brand new model. The old mutant carries a little better but they removed a lot of unnecessary features/straps on the new one and the buckles are much more friendly with gloves on. They are both great packs. Awesome for ice and alpine! ,Oct 2015,Oct 3 2018,0

3217,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,6, Thank you so much guys. I apologize the delay~ however as I'm a new member they restricted my amount of interactions. Chris I knew that osprey had a good warranty bit it turns out they have an AMAZING warranty txs for pointing it out. Don they look nice and pricey~ I went to Red Rock with my buddy he just bought the new link from Patagonia looks similar ... much cheaper price though. And I was surprise how good and functional that style of bag is. Briggs~ you are right~ btw I love the looks of the pack. How do the straps handle weight? The model I saw it basically has a strap to tie the rope to the exterior I think.  Scott~ you nailed it regarding the load hauling~ I wasn't sure of the v mod to the panel would be good. Sadly or for good I ended up ordering the new 38l mutant. I will try to update on how it performs (I do tend to pack heavy and this was a big concern ) I also think new mutant design and material won't make it as versatile (season wise) as the previous model. Again txs to all,Sep 2018,Oct 4 2018,0
3218,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,7, You'll be happy with the Mutant. I can't imagine going with any of the other packs mentioned if you're going to actually use it for ski touring.,Apr 2011,Oct 4 2018,1

3221,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,10," I just got a Mutant 28 (old version~ this size is discontinued) for use as an all-purpose climbing pack. Haven't used it yet other than the obligatory ""put all my gear in it and walk around the house"" but at first glance it seems to be very well-designed and -built. It holds a full rack~ shoes~ and 2L of water with plenty of room left for a jacket or two and some food~ maybe basic bivy gear also. Based on my first impression it is small enough to be manageable when climbing~ but I wonder if the same could be said for the 33% larger model? I notice that the waist belt is much less robust than what you would find on a decent backpacking pack~ but this may be intentional to avoid interfering with a harness. ",Oct 2017,Oct 24 2018,0
3222,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,11, This.  I have the older neon Mutant 28L and it's a great 'do it all' pack in that size that carries fairly well (said by someone that needs a L4/L5 fusion).,Jun 2017,Nov 3 2018,0
3223,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,12, I just got the older model mutant 28~ and am really liking it~ obviously haven’t taken it out on ice yet but has every feature I want and non I don’t and carries everything I need very comfortably.,Oct 2014,Nov 3 2018,0
3224,Osprey mutant or Mountain Hardwear multipitch?,1,13, Time to resurrect this thread. Bought the MH multi25 and it's a freaking champ. Could barely notice it was there (only had shoes~ water and a puffy inside during the climb)~ but it took about a full double rack~ big gun harness~ and puffy~ all in the main compartment. Rope cinches on very nicely with the rope strap~ and shoes hung cleanly on the pack~ never whacked me or felt them flopping about as we walked off. Weight carried well but I'm most impressed by how much friggin stuff I managed to stuff inside. Doubles from 0 to bd #3~ a 4~ two nut racks~ 10 or 12 alpine draws~ two 1L water bottles~ a puffy *not* stuffed in a sack. Dang~ I'm sold. Not sure they're even making this anymore~ but looking to get another one for a buddy~ as he loved it as well.,Aug 2017,May 14 2019,1

3230,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,5, Paul...as the previous posters have stated the Geniuses are light~ sticky~ and sensitive~ but it takes a few outings to wrap your head around how to place the edgeless shoe on footholds~ especially if you have worn a good edging shoe in the past. It's a quality problem for sure.,Jan 2007,Sep 16 2018,0
3231,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,6, I had 3-4 pairs of the Futura~ and recently moved to the Genius. Big fan of both of them.,Jan 2018,Sep 21 2018,0
3232,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,7, Love them/no edge technology... you get used to it fast. Using the Futuras as gym shoes~ Genius for hard outdoor~ and TC Pros for trad~ multi... never been happier with my shoe quiver.,Sep 2011,Sep 21 2018,0
3233,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,8, I love my Futuras - also No-Edge - in the gym (mainly because of durability and the fact you have to be more precise with your feet on steep terrain) or outdoor edging routes that aren’t super steep.  I prefer Solutions for pocket climbing as the Futuras have a very blunt toe that doesn’t fit as well in pocket footholds.  ,Jul 2008,Sep 21 2018,1
3234,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,9, Didn't take long to get used to the no-edge. Put your foot on hold~ foot sticks to hold~ voila! I was such a fan when I got these~ that I bought a pair of Maverinks for gym climbing. My feet get pretty tired after a couple hours of bouldering in the Maverinks~ but have been very happy with the no-edge rubber on all type of terrain.,Jun 2016,Sep 21 2018,2

3239,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,14, I wonder if they can do the no edge resole far any shoe?? I've wondered that as well. I also wonder if they'd do en edged resole on an edgeless shoe~ though I'm only academically curious; it's not something I'd ever do.,Jul 2016,Sep 21 2018,0
3240,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,15, I've wondered that as well. I also wonder if they'd do en edged resole on an edgeless shoe~ though I'm only academically curious; it's not something I'd ever do. I have seen photos of this done on a few different shoes. Here are a pair (photo stolen from this thread). ,Mar 2010,Sep 21 2018,0
3241,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,16, Did they actually do this for you? I've requested this of them in the past with my Speedsters and they came back with an edge.,Feb 2016,Sep 21 2018,0
3242,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,17, Yes~ I had 1 pair of futuras resoled by them with no-edge. I did have another pair come back with an edge in another case. No real clarification why~ but I assume it was due to some damage to the rand that prevented no-edge resoling.,Jan 2018,Sep 21 2018,1
3243,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,18, Forgive me for going back to basic~ but what is the whole idea behind no edge? How is it different than your gym shoe that has been rounded out due to your shitty ass footwork?,Aug 2014,Sep 22 2018,1
3244,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,19, IMO it’s very similar. I was an exclusive Miura Lace guy for many years~ and my ‘sweet spot’ was always after a few months of breaking them in and having the edge round out a bit and they’d become smedging machines. I got a pair of Geniuses about a year ago because I wanted something more aggressive~ and found that the No Edge was basically getting the sweet spot out of the box with no break in.,Oct 2010,Sep 22 2018,0
3245,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,1,20, I got my solutions resoled as no edge and they’re certainly different.  I don’t have anything to compare unfortunately.  But they have taken some getting used to indoors and I’m trying them outdoors this weekend.  I’ll keep everyone updated,Jan 2019,Feb 6 2019,2
3246,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,2,0, I've wondered that as well. I also wonder if they'd do en edged resole on an edgeless shoe~ though I'm only academically curious; it's not something I'd ever do. I’ve had one of my futuras resoled with an edge (couldnt find a canadian resoler to do edgeless at the time) they now feel similiar to my otakis~ just more sensitive.,Mar 2015,Mar 5 2019,1
3247,La Sportiva Genius no edge shoes,2,1, Any update and perhaps pictures? ,Jan 2019,May 7 2019,2
3248,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,0, I've been trying to find a shoe for some slightly over hanging sport and Boulder problems.  I'm considering the quantums as it seems the reviews say they are good for this.  I want to stick with 5.10s as they tend to fit my feet~ I prefer lace ups (I didn't like hiangles).  I have pinks in 10.5 and they fit great after breaking in and stretching.  I have Blanco's in 11s.   I guess my question is: do the quantums stretch like the pinks?  Should I go with the 10.5 or 11?  Thanks.,Apr 2017,Mar 26 2019,0
3249,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,1, I'm a street size 10~ and I wear my Anasazi VCS and Hiangles a size 10 as well.  My Quantum Lace ups are 10.5.  At first I ordered them in 10 but they were too tight. ,Mar 2018,Mar 26 2019,0
3250,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,2, I do hiangles at 9.5~ quantums and quantum vcs at 10. Very minimal stretch.  ,Jul 2011,Mar 26 2019,0
3251,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,3, Very minimal stretch~ but they stretched in the right places for my longer second toe.  I have a 9 (most)-9.5(nike running) street shoe.  9.5 in Quantums  9.5 in Verdon 10 in Pinkies sized to be all day comfy~ could .5 size down for more performance,Oct 2011,Mar 26 2019,2
3252,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,4, They do break it pretty well but it does take a long time~ I've had mine for over a year and never soaked them~ just worn them climbing and grimace through the pain. I will say~ if you want nice overhang bouldering shoes check out the Hiangles~ single velcro~ light and sensitive they're my gym shoe now a days.,Jan 2017,Mar 27 2019,0
3253,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,5, I wasn’t a fan of the hiangles.  I think I’m going to order the same size as my Blancos and hope for the best. ,Apr 2017,Mar 27 2019,0
3254,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,6, Street size for tight but comfortable fit. Half size down for uncomfortable~ ten minute fit. They are nowhere near as tight as the blancos for me. ,Mar 2017,Mar 27 2019,3
3255,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,7, I wear 11s in pinks for comfort fit and 10.5 in quantum lace for performance fit. Took about 5 sessions to break in the quantums.,May 2018,Mar 27 2019,1
3256,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,8, Well the 11s came in today and they feel the same as the Blanco's for me.  Pretty comfy with a slight arch~ so hoping the don't stretch much as they fit about as good as I could hope given my foot shape.,Apr 2017,Mar 29 2019,0
3257,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,9, Street shoe size is perfect for an all day/trad shoe with a little downturn. Has anyone else had durability issues with them? Mine had a hole popped in the rand after only a couple months of light use.,Jan 2018,Mar 30 2019,1
3258,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,10, Technique is what creates holes in rands   ,Oct 2011,Mar 31 2019,1
3259,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,11, Technique is what creates holes in rands    I've been through plenty of resoles in other shoes and haven't had this happen before. I do catch myself toe dragging once in a while~ but I don't wear these shoes when I'm climbing at my limit (not that I wouldn't~ I just don't push trad grades too often),Jan 2018,Apr 1 2019,0
3260,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,12, Yeah had the same issue. Two months in hole popped in rand. I think it's because the rand hangs over the sole significantly so even if you're not dragging your toes~ your rand is always contacting the wall. This is the only reason I won't repurchase the shoes. They're otherwise awesome.,May 2018,Apr 1 2019,1
3261,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,13, This happens to every pair of quantums I own. From what I can tell~ the rand hanging over the shoe gives it the sensitivity that they are known for. My other shoes don’t suffer the same fate. I’ve noticed that after a resole~ they seem to last much longer. ,Mar 2017,Apr 1 2019,0
3262,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,14, Have the holes gotten much worse with time? I'm wondering if it's worth getting them resoled early if it means the shoe won't fall apart,Jan 2018,Apr 1 2019,0
3263,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,15, You lose the initial stiffness of the shoe~ but the first resole/rand has lasted me much longer. Any hole in the rand will pretty much get worse~ but keep in mind that as long as you don’t blow a hole in the upper you should be ok. I don’t resole until i absolutely have to. Despite resolers telling me I should resole sooner than later~ yosemite bum has returned my shoes in like-new condition every time.,Mar 2017,Apr 1 2019,2
3264,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,16, Have they had any trouble resoling if you try to patch the holes? I'm wondering if a dab of shoegoo would do any good,Jan 2018,Apr 1 2019,0
3265,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,17, I personally havent patched holes~ but I don’t see why the resolers couldn’t take it off if you did. ,Mar 2017,Apr 1 2019,1
3266,5.10 Quantum sizing question,1,18, I wear 9.5 Hiangle~ 10 Dragon and Team. Looking at these for sport or long~ techy boulders. Hoping for more edging support than Hiangles~ but are they that much better or should I go Anasazi VCS or Pinks?,May 2017,May 4 2019,0
3267,Moccasym State?,1,0, Just wondering if anyone knows if they ever fixed the leather on the moccasym. The reviews on the website are all negative~ but also kinda old. Wasn't sure if they fixed the quality or if people just stopped buying them.,Apr 2016,Nov 10 2018,0
3268,Moccasym State?,1,1, I bought a pair 3-4 months ago.  They are falling apart on me.  Leather torn~ rubber delaminating on the uppers and where the sole meets the rand. Basically all I've used them for is 0.75-1.0 cam sized crack training and 5-6 trips to the gym.  I don't know if I'll ever buy another pair to be honest.,Aug 2014,Nov 10 2018,3
3269,Moccasym State?,1,2, so they did start making mocs that had a synthetic strip of leather around the heel.  I have a thread here about it https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114378480/they-changed-the-moc. from what I heard adidas knows there has been a bad run of mocs and are pretty sympathetic to returns however I have not had any unlucky mocs and have not made any returns so all that information has been hearsay.   I do know that they are out of stock in a lot of places and I ask adidas if it was discontinued however they said it was just out of stock until mid december.   Lastly~ if youre interested though I havent tried them out~ I heard the OG group of fiveten folks started their own shoe company you can checkout unparallelsports.com/produc…,Dec 2013,Dec 7 2018,4
3270,Moccasym State?,1,3, Thank you!,Apr 2016,Dec 7 2018,0

3272,Moccasym State?,1,5, I've gotta confess...I thought from the thread title this was going to be about a lesser-known college football team.,Mar 2015,Dec 7 2018,14
3273,Moccasym State?,1,6, I had a pair start to tear on me in the spring~ but that was probably 300 pitches into the year and 3-4 days/wk at the gym,Mar 2016,Dec 7 2018,0
3274,Moccasym State?,1,7, just ordered a pair and will have break-in and Quality report in like 2-3 weeks.,Mar 2016,Dec 17 2018,4
3275,Moccasym State?,1,8, i've got good reviews personally,Dec 2018,Dec 20 2018,0
3276,Moccasym State?,1,9, just bought a pair~ will be back w reviews soon,Apr 2016,Dec 21 2018,0
3277,Moccasym State?,1,10, willing to try again to be honest. last pair was shit~ but still havnt found replacement,Aug 2014,Dec 21 2018,0
3278,Moccasym State?,1,11, I’ve been wearing a new pair for a few sessions (I got them a few days ago) and they still have the synthetic heel wrap strap and they rock.  I downsize heavily in moccs and it takes a lot of pulling to get them on the first time and they haven’t torn. I think in my exhaustive testing of trying one pair it is safe to say I’ll be buying them again ,Dec 2013,Dec 24 2018,0
3279,Moccasym State?,1,12, Let’s see... 1) The overwhelming majority of shoes don’t have any problems.  This seems to be a squeaky wheel phenomenon. 2) 5.10 has addressed the QC issue and is replacing defective shoes when people report them. 3) There really is no direct alternative to Moccs.  The Evolvs are close but shittier rubber and synthetic so GL on fit and the Up Moccs are ?? Seems like a pretty straightforward decision to me.,Jul 2014,Dec 25 2018,0
3280,Moccasym State?,1,13, Are you saying the Evolv addicts are synthetic?  The addict upper is unlined leather. https://evolvsports.com/addict/  ,Aug 2012,Dec 25 2018,0
3281,Moccasym State?,1,14, Oh!  My mistake.  I thought they only came in Synthetics.  I think it’s really a matter of luck; if your foot happens to fit the shoe then synthetics are great~ but leather is much more forgiving.,Jul 2014,Dec 25 2018,0

3283,Moccasym State?,1,16, My pair from 2 months ago just started to split in the middle of the red leather~ just like others' pictures on MP.  I thought I would be special and have Moccs that lasted... Oh well.  Reporting them to 5.10 seems like a good idea.,Sep 2018,Dec 30 2018,1
3284,Moccasym State?,1,17, I think the Addict is a superior shoe. Better heel and rubber. Can't beat the price. Never had any Evovl shoe blow out.,unknown,Dec 30 2018,1
3285,Moccasym State?,1,18," Buy them from a reputable dealer with a solid return policy and make sure to wear them a decent amount the first month you have them. If they don't rip in 5 sessions~ you should be good to go. Bought a pair 6 months ago that ripped in one gym session. Sent them back and the new pair has been great. I noticed the bad shoe's leather looked ""fluffy"" and not super smooth. Interestingly it was only the right shoe~ the left looked normal (and also didn't tear). That may be a sign of issues~ but one case is hard to say for sure. ",Sep 2017,Dec 31 2018,0

3295,Moccasym State?,2,7, That is bizarre.  Walls and volumes should act essentially the same as holds.  What shoes are you using?  When I used Solutions~ the Grip 2 rubber worked great indoors.  Not quite as sticky as C4 but more durable.  Edge~ on the other hand~ is barely useable indoors but great outdoors for me.,Jul 2014,Jan 3 2019,0

3297,Moccasym State?,2,9, I can't tell if this is a serious thread anymore.... In any case~ got my new moccs in and they are breaking in really well with no significant signs of the leather tears as seen in previous lots. I don't really test the leather for wear in cracks as I slather it in rubber post break-in/pre-crack usage. I wouldn't mind seeing a slightly more resilience in the midsole~ which has occasionally deformed beyond use on me after super sweaty days outside or in the gym.,Mar 2016,Jan 3 2019,0
3298,Moccasym State?,2,10, For what it’s worth I got a new pair of Mocs and they’ve ripped in the same spot after 3 times in the gym :/,Dec 2018,Jan 11 2019,0
3299,Moccasym State?,2,11, I think the durability has something to do with how you size them~ as well. If you like down sizing your mocc from an 11 to a 8 1/2~ you might have some problems. I know people that do this and it just doesn't make any sense to me (one for sure has rips from pulling them on). If your shoe fits~ it's not going to stretch much~ even though they have the ability to stretch a lot. I wear a 10 and 10.5 in Hiangles~ and wear a 10 in Moccs and they haven't stretched out beyond the typical molding around my feet. They're not sloppy or floppy at all~ and have only gotten better. If you want a performance shoe~ buy a performance shoe. (Sorry DM) (But~ obviously do what you want. I know moccs are very versitle and I could see someone having many sizes of moccs)  For the record~ one pair that I bought ripped by the 3rd gym session. The replaced pair has been great and is almost ready for its first resole.,Sep 2017,Jan 11 2019,0
3300,Moccasym State?,2,12, I know a lot of old school sport climbers who wear tight Moccs on the steeps...they can be really good. If you size them down~ they’ll stretch to be decently comfortable in the right places (toebox) while remaining tight in the heel~ which can get pretty loose if you don’t downsize.  People have had their shoes slip off on a heel hook...probably depends on your foot.,Jul 2014,Jan 11 2019,3
3301,Moccasym State?,2,13, Is it safe to assume that you climb harder than your ticklist on here? I would say for someone doing hard-ish trad~ the huge downsize is necessary to hit those little face feet but also allow for wiggling into finger cracks. I had a larger pair of moccs and they would spin around on my foot after a couple weeks of regular high mileage use.,Mar 2016,Jan 14 2019,0

3303,Moccasym State?,2,15, I just returned a pair to REI that I purchased in October. They developed a dime-size hole in a non-stressed part of the upper.

3308,Moccasym State?,3,0, These are my favorite shoe~ but since Adidas bought Five Ten~ the quality and customer service has fallen by the waist side~ is it just better to buy a new pair~ $125~ when Five Ten owned Five Ten those shoes went for $89!!! :-(,Mar 2013,Mar 18 2019,3
3309,Moccasym State?,3,1, This is my first pair after going through 2 pairs of the Evolv Addicts. I loved the way they felt~ but clearly QC is gone. Im going to try the the Up Mocc and if those arent that great I think I will just get Addicts and get them resoled with the five ten rubber. ,Sep 2017,Mar 18 2019,2
3310,Moccasym State?,3,2, The UP Mocc is not a direct replacement for the 5.10 Mocc. The UP Mocc is extremely stiff~ and there's no way they'll ever get as soft and pliable as a well worn Mocc~ which is really what we're all after. Right? The rubber is simply too firm to ever get the sensitivity that the Mocc gets over time~ although I really like their rubber~ maybe even more than C4. Also~ the toe rubber seems like it would not allow for the same kind of foot wedging in thin stuff~ that again~ most people I know who wear them are after. I definitely think Unparallel should be supported~ because they make great shoes~ and quite possibly the best rubber~ but I just wanted to warn that the UP Mocc will be a dissapointment if you are looking for alternatives to the 5.10 Mocc~ unless you are just looking for a cheaper gym shoe.,Sep 2017,Mar 18 2019,1
3311,Moccasym State?,3,3, I have had over 12 pairs of Mocs. It is by far my favorite shoe. But this happened two days ago~ after only 5 days of use.

3319,Moccasym State?,3,11, I remember paying $90 for Mocs within the last few years....2012 seems about right. Like a lot of people~ I've had 10-15 or so pairs over the last 20 years and have never had a problem with blowouts~ etc on any of them. ,Dec 2007,Mar 22 2019,0
3320,Moccasym State?,3,12, Sure~ that's b/c folks don't like to pay full retail.  But whether you believe it or not~ Mocs went from $89 to $99 in 1993/94. Their MSRP in 2004 was $100.,Jul 2009,Mar 26 2019,4
3321,Moccasym State?,3,13, I got my shoes replaced through the warranty. It took about 3 weeks~ but Agron Inc~ that handles the warranties for Adidas~ did a good job of customer services and kept me updated through out the process. The new pair of Mocs that I pulled out to replace the ones I sent back~ did have some wear issues. After about 7 uses they blowout under the elastic. So unfortunately I think Adidas is having quality issues~ BIG TIME! I am not going to do the warranty thing this time~ because it doesn’t really affect the performance. To bad I love these shoes so much~ so I will most likely keep buying them as long as they make them... but others should consider other shoes if they want quality.,Jun 2014,Apr 18 2019,1

3329,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,0," The past couple of weeks~ I've been researching new shoes. This is because my gym beaters also became outdoor shoes for a couple of Shelf trips when the Mythos bought the farm~ thus accelerating wear. Also~ I discovered last weekend that I needed to stop using the Mantras ASAP until the toe caps were rebuilt~ or I'd break through the stitching. I also wanted to explore other options because I'm feeling a bit of the same itch that resulted in switching from Evolv Defys to the Mythos a few years ago - occasionally there are limitations to what I can do~ sprinkled with a bit of curiosity about new-to-me models. So I stopped into a couple of shops and tried things on. Here are the results~ summarized: * Butora Mantra (green) Fit well~ both due to width and due to lacing all the way to toe. Can take a couple of months to break in~ expect to put extra focus on your footwork during that time to avoid skating off holds you didn't expect~ but once they break in~ they are great for bouldering~ man that stiff sole really helps when you're a lardass like me. Def getting the pair I have resoled~ and was notably tempted to buy another pair in the meantime. * Butora Altura (green) Nominally same size~ shape~ and color as Mantra but in a mid top. Easily went on feet~ but I'll be damned if I'm going to have a pair of shoes rub my Achilles so badly it will leave me bleeding after a full day of climbing. Might work with some moleskin~ but~ if I'm getting the Mantras resoled~ why bother... I definitely encourage other people to try them~ you might not have same issue as me. * Butora Narsha (orange; possibly discontinued?) Had not heard of these before this weekend~ but they were listed on Rock & Resole's website~ so added to list to try. Apparently all the orange model have been sold since they are now on clearance and won't be reordered. I did get to try on a size 14 pair in Wilderness Exchange's consignment bin. That pair was amply wide~ just too long; I'd want to try size 13 (or maybe even 12.5) vs the 14. I'm mentioning here in case someone else finds the info useful and sees a sale. * Sportiva Tarantulace New to me. Someone in a 2017 thread said ""try these""~ so I added to my notes. Ended up buying a pair~ immediately went to bouldering gym. They performed well~ i.e.~ no major break-in period needed. These may be my new gym shoes since the Cypher Prefix has been discontinued. * Sportiva Skwama Hard no for me. 45 goes on the feet but has dead space between toes and toe cap. 44.5 went on feet after significant struggle~ but immediately started restricting circulation to toes. * Scarpa Vapor V Also a no. Couldn't get on my feet~ even after going up a couple of sizes from comparable Mythos size. * Scarpa Helix Went on feet. One foot fit like a dream~ the other fit like a toss up between months of breaking in at the pinky toe and possibly never breaking in at all. If money were no object~ I'd get a pair just to take the gamble. * Evolv The General I tried these on the suggestion of R&R's staff. Whoever The General is~ his feet would not appear to be particularly wide. * Mad Rock Agama Close but no cigar. And by close~ I mean I came close to whacking sales rep in the head trying to get one on my damn foot when she sat down to try and help. Even after sizing up to the biggest WildyX has in stock. * Sportiva Kataki You can't believe everything you read on the internet. Like many athletic shoes in my past~ sizing wide enough to get on my foot required sizing long enough to have significant empty space between toes and shoe. Tried 3 pairs~ I believe. * BD anything There's lies~ damned lies~ and claims that anything with BD's name on it is wide.",May 2016,Feb 17 2019,7
3330,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,1, Regarding scarpa vs sportiva sizing~ they are miles apart. When I used to cram my foot into shoes that were too narrow for me (katanas) I wore a 42 sportiva. I wear a 44 or a 44.5 in most scarpa models... which happens to be my street shoe size.  My foot is wide~ but not absurdly so. I find I can’t wear any sportiva.  Because of the shape of my foot~ I can’t wear scarpas from the Instinct line~ but most of their other shoes tend to fit me pretty well.  I’m surprised mythos worked for you. Sure~ they are highly adjustable~ but I looked at the toe shape~ and then at the shape of my forefoot~ they are not even close. ,Nov 2006,Feb 18 2019,1
3331,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,2, Nice to hear~ I'll try goong further up next time a Scarpa looks intriguing. Still a gamble though~ my feet are 4E at the best of times. Anything unlined leather upper stretches a lot~ so works great. Certainly not aggressive~ but as the gent at R&R mused~ just about anything beats the shoe you can't get on your foot.,May 2016,Feb 18 2019,0
3332,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,3, Interesting that you're that far apart between scarpa and sportiva. For me the split is typically one euro size up in scarpa. Testes and skwama are a 40~ drago and chimera are a 41. I do bump up to a 41.5 vapor lace for trad though and was down in a 39.5 for the pythons. ,Jan 2015,Feb 21 2019,0

3334,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,5, Mythos is pretty much the only shoe I've ever been able to wear without incredible big toe pain. I own 4 pair of various sizes and rubbers I do have Muiras that have stretched out well and are tolerable for single pitch.  Moccasins also fit well after a break in but I don't particulary like them except for very specific application (thin cracks and overhanging cobbles) Other soft leather shoes have too much rubber around the toebox to allow stretch. Anyone else experience this with other shoe recs? ,Apr 2007,Feb 22 2019,0
3335,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,6, I used to get the big toe pain from my katanas. I thought it was because 1 they were too narrow for me and 2 the shape of the forefoot. My instep is like a straight line~ but some shoes kind of pull your big toe in towards the second toe. My foot shape isn’t like that~ so the first thing I do now is look st the shape of the sole~ to see if it approximates the shape of my foot. ,Nov 2006,Feb 22 2019,1
3336,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,7, ^^I had the exact same problem with Katanas.  I found that if you sized up a little higher they worked well~ especially since the heel was nice and narrow~ but you’re probably right that they’re not a great fit for wide feet.How do your heels compare to your forefoot?  I have narrow heels and wide forefeet~ which is a pain because everything either results in crammed toes or loose heels.  The Five Ten Anasazi line is perfect for my foot FWIW~ especially the laces (Pink~ Blanco).  I’m surprised the Scarpas didn’t work~ as they tend to run wide.,Jul 2014,Feb 22 2019,0
3337,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,8, Re heels~ I’m not really sure. I’d guess medium. I haven’t really had much of an issue with heels~ so long as the rand is snug on the Achilles and there isn’t too much dead space. The blanco is bad on my heel~ the Pink is better. I’ve definitely put up with poor heels over the years if I like the toe box of shoes.  The anasazis in general are not a great fit for me~ they are too narrow for anything with any slab on it~ slab puts too much bad pressure on my big toes~ which have issues from the years wearing the wrong shoes.  Which sucks~ because the Pink is my favorite shoe to climb in~ nothing else has the power under the toe quite the same.  I mostly try new scarpas because they fit the best~ but noting climbs for me like the pink. The Boostic seems like it would~ but they are just different and don’t feel nearly as good. The old orange vapors fit perfect but they changed the toe in the green ones and they don’t fit me nearly as well. I haven’t tried the new Magos~ but I like the old ones. The Chimera fits me really well but I haven’t used them yet~ and I think they’ll be softer than I prefer. I’m 185~ so I like a stiffer boot. ,Nov 2006,Feb 22 2019,0
3338,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,9, I've got a wide forefoot and a narrowish heel. I've found 5.10 pinks and scarpa Instict vs to work for me pretty well. Most sportiva is painful.,May 2012,Feb 22 2019,2
3339,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,10, Scarpa heels have too much deadspace for me. Skwama in 40 is bliss. Hiangles are OK once they break in~ but suck at first. Katanas seem better for me than Katakis~ and Testarossas are by far the best fit.,May 2017,Apr 10 2019,0
3340,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,11, Feet shaped like Donald Duck. Tarantulace of the current crop of midrange/budget shoes fit me best. ,Feb 2019,Apr 10 2019,0
3341,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,12," Another mid-wide forefoot + narrow heel climber checking in who has tried nearly every shoe on the market... many Five Ten shoes fit this bill~ specifically the blue Quantum Lace and Quantum VCS~ but also the Blackwing and Dragon. Quantum Lace + Butora Acro + Scarpa Instinct VS are all pretty similar fits~ with the Quantum Lace having the most narrow / low volume heel of the bunch... it's currently my fav shoe for every kind of climbing. Ridiculously versatile~ perfect level of stiffness. For the record I think the idea of a ""beater shoe"" is dumb. Train how you want to perform. If you're an AAC member~ you get 40% off of 5.10 shoes... this is the only gear that directly affects performance~ and I know many absolute dirtbags who still gladly fork over $30 every 6 months to climb their best.",Sep 2016,Apr 16 2019,1
3342,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,13, I have a wide foot and can now report the Scarpa Origin fits it nicely and is not that expensive to boot. It took a little while to break in~ and they aren't as comfy as Moccasyms~ but the velcro closures are nice. No heel deadspace issues~ either. I had that issue on the 5.10 Rogues.,Jan 2001,Apr 16 2019,0
3343,ATTN: Brotherhood of the Wide Forefoot - shoe info/brief reviews,1,14, I agree with Svvenson on the 5.10 Quantum~ wide forefoot~ narrow heel. I prefer the VCS~ it feels like it puts more power through the toe. Note the Quantum does stretch about 1/2 size so I got them pretty tight so they didnt turn floppy.  I also have a pair of Tenaya Mundakas for the gym that fit amazingly well. They dont have the widest last~ but the whole shoe is like a stretchable sock~ it accommodates a wide foot easily. Very comfortable shoe. I tried climbing outdoors with them in a variety of places ( Seneca~ Reeds~ Carderock ) and they are just too soft for me on real rock. Great gym shoes though. ,Jul 2017,Apr 16 2019,1

3346,Butura Acro Narrow,1,0, I got the Acros a few months ago and have done lots of indoor and outdoor climbing on them~ here's my opinion: They are similar to Solutions EXCEPT I don't like the rubber on my Acros - I just isn't sticky and I can't trust my feet like I can with solutions (or even my finales). The Acros are very stiff~ which makes edging good~ but the rubber isn't soft enough and doesn't get as much friction as other shoes. If I had to equate the feeling~ I would say that the rubber sticks and feels similar to LS Tarantulace (FriXion RS). This kind of defeats the purpose of having a shoe that is aggressive and sold as a roof climbing machine. Nevertheless~ I still wear the Acros often - they are comfortable (but not as easy to take on/off as I was expecting) and I assume that the rubber will last longer than the softer stuff I find in XS Grip 2~ XS Edge and C4. Here are my rankings for favorite shoes if that puts things into perspective:,May 2018,Apr 8 2019,1
3347,Howey Tool X-Dream Pick Review,1,0, Now with a few days under my belt on new picks for my Cassin X-Dreams from Howey Tools~ I thought I'd post a review up here for a great small business. After burning through about 1-2 picks a season on the Mixt picks for the x-dream~ I was beginning to consider selling my tools for either Grivels or Nomics. Frankly~ I was getting sick of having to tune the picks after every climbing day~ and sometimes mid-day. I love the x-dreams~ but the reality of spending somewhere around 100-200 bucks a season to keep my picks sharp~ the nomic or tech-machine was starting to look appealing.  Krukonogi's had been around awhile~ but at $70 a pop and having to order them from Russia~ I was a little gun shy. I found Howey Tools~ and at ~$40/pick USD~ I thought it was worth a shot before selling off the tools. I ordered the picks from his website~ and with the roughly $15 shipping for expedited shipping (just $2 more)~ they arrived in under a week from Canada to Montana.  They mounted easily~ and come with bolts (higher quality than stock X-Dream bolts).  The ice picks don't extend quite as far down the tool as the stock Mixt picks~ but otherwise the geometry is very similar.  They are slightly narrower than the Mixt~ and have a very different cutout pattern and drilled holes which allow them to use petzl massolettes if you want to add pick weights.  One of the picks was slightly harder to install - the hole seemed ever-so-slightly out of line~ but it only took a few seconds of fiddling to get it one. My first day out on them~ the ice in Hyalite was wet and plasticy for the first few routes~ all which were WI3.  The sticks were solid - almost all 1 swing hits - but the ice was so wet~ that I really don't think picks would have mattered. Cleaning the tools in this ice was just as easy as the mixt~ if not moreso.  I have heard kruk picks need to be detuned on the teeth closer to the shaft - not so for the Howey picks.  Toward the end of the day~ though~ I got on a route that was more sheltered and the ice was a bit harder and much thinner. I found I was able to gently tap into the harder~ colder ice and get very solid sticks.   As the ice got thicker~ I was still able to get 1-swing sticks on almost every hit.  Compared to my Mixt picks~ I was definitely displacing less ice.  Most impressively~ I took a swing into what I thought was deeper ice~ and hit rock below.  When I looked at the pick after~ it was barely dinged at all.  That would have blunted my mixt pick~ and required a tune up that shaved a centimeter of length.  The Howey pick was barely scratched. This weekend~ I got some colder climbs in early in the morning.  The picks on cold ice still displace ice compared to a nomic pur'ice pick~ but man~ they are leagues ahead of the Mixt.  Still mostly getting 1 swing hits on ice that was pretty picked out.  I got on a steeper WI4/4+ with a mixture of ice that was dripping wet and ice that was old and brittle~ and was able to either bury the tools to the head in the wet ice to get a screw in~ or gently tap into the old~ brittle ice for solid sticks.   Overall~ I would highly recommend these picks for x-dream users. They are about the same price~ and way more durable.  They outperfom stock mixt pick and the ice pick on ice~ and have comparable performance on rock.,Jun 2012,Jan 13 2019,9
3348,Howey Tool X-Dream Pick Review,1,1, I have posted so much about how much I like the Howey Tool picks over the stock X-Dream picks~ Howey should give a commission. It took me awhile to get used to climbing multiple days in row without needing to file my picks~ my files are getting lonely.  After upgrading to the Howey picks~ buy the Petzl pick weights:  https://www.petzl.com/NL/en/Sport/Ice-axes/MASSELOTTES and ice climbing will become so easy you'll need to start mixed climbing.  Howey~ still can't wait for those here-any-day-now X-dream picks with hammers...,Apr 2014,Jan 15 2019,5
3349,Howey Tool X-Dream Pick Review,1,2, I've used a Howey pick on my Nomics for most of the season.  For comparison~ one tool has a Pur Ice pick~ the other has the Howey.  At first I thought the Howey worked very slightly better (good sticks~ good cleaning) than the Pur Ice in various ice conditions.  After using it extensively~ I really can't tell the difference with the Pur Ice.  Upon receiving the picks~ the pick design~ with the claw-like first tooth~ concerned me as to its durability.  With the claw design~ you have very limited resharpenings before the tooth is gone~ unlike the Pur Ice which has a longer first tooth. Upon hitting a rock a few days ago~ my concerns were supported--the tooth was beat down~ and sharpening took a lot of life out of the pick. Although the steel is supposed to be tougher~ I have not been able to detect any difference from the Petzl pick via sharpening with a file--doesn't seem to be any harder steel~ and sharpens easily.  I haven't hit a rock with the Petzl pick~ so no comparison there. Sooo~ I'll go back to the Pur Ice pick--seems to last longer with no degradation in performance.  Regarding the Pur Ice~ it does seem to be a lot nicer in thick ice than the standard Petzl Ice pick.,Mar 2016,Apr 2 2019,3
3350,Howey Tool X-Dream Pick Review,1,3, TLDR: howey tool picks for x-dreams are much better than the picks from Cassin and you should buy a pair,Sep 2015,Apr 6 2019,2
3351,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,0," Part 1: Initial Observations and Trailrunning Test (seggzy gotesox sold separately)  Background: I've never seen the need for approach shoes. My trail runners (Montrail Mountain Masochists) have always served me well as regards weight~ comfort and durability~ especially on my 24-day CT thru-hike. I tend to shoe up for anything over 5.6 anyway~ so I figured the extra climbability of dedicated approach shoes would be superfluous. The TX2's crossed my radar when my buddy wore a pair to approach Atlantis in the Black Canyon. I was especially intrigued by how thin they packed with the heel strap -- easily half the bulk of my trail runners. The grippy sole seemed to serve him well on the exposed low-fifth scramble to the base of the route. My main hesitation was how well the shoe would handle running. My trailrunners were due for replacement~ and I wondered if the TX2s could cover for them. I had plans for a four-day fastpack of the Grenadiers that included some fifth-class slabbing where sticky rubber would be a plus (now postponed due to early-onset monsoon~ grr). So when a good deal arose~ I pulled the trigger. With my toe~ just like Papa Hemingway. This is part one of three~ the trailrunning test. I'll follow up regarding climbability after a day of wearing them on 5.10-11~ and then again regarding durability after I put some backpacking mileage on them. Initial Observations: The shoes are light. Advertised at 9.8 oz compared to MMM's 10.8~ they feel comparable. The fit is spot-on. I wear 43.0 in TC Pro's and 10.0 in MMM's. The toebox is comfortable but doesn't allow extraneous movement. Using the attached heel bungee cord~ they stow away satisfactorily. The sidewalls of the shoe are a bit stiff still~ but should soften up and compress better as they break in. The ""climb zone"" edging platform is surprisingly stiff~ as is the forefoot of the shoe. I expect the latter to soften up over time~ but the edging capabilities of the toe look promising. Field Test: I took the TX2's for a spin on our local chosspile 12~900~ Engineer Mountain. The terrain is varied as it gains 2500' over hardpack~ snow~ steep mud~ fluid talus~ 3rd/4th class and a wee bit of 5.2. I carried two liters of water and ran whenever possible. I took my Montrails on the exact same route the week before~ so I had a good basis for comparison. The shoes were stellar for running the flats and uphills~ almost as good as the MMM's. The downhills were less comfortable (aren't they always?) ... the impact was more noticeable~ and my back started to hurt. Contrary to other reviewers~ the shoes were not much more sensitive underfoot -- I was able to pick the same downhill lines as usual. Also~ the sidewall chafed at my ankle bone slightly on the downs. They weren't as good as the MMM's in the mud. It seems like the circular lugs didn't gain as much traction. On fluid talus~ the shoes performed as expected for their weight. I wouldn't want to do any sustained scree surfing for fear of thrashing them. For 3rd/4th/low5th~ I was suitably impressed by the stickiness of the rubber and the stability of the toe edge. Even with some mud on the soles~ they stuck like champs. Conclusion: So far~ I'm impressed. We'll see what subsequent tests yield. My biggest complaint is that the stock insoles may be too flimsy for sustained downhill trail running (but then again~ these aren't marketed as trail runners). I'll try it again with some thicker ones. The biggest advantage I can see for these will be their low weight/bulk for walkoffs~ and not needing to bring separate climbing shoes for easy alpine. In the next week~ I'll push the TX2s to their limit on granite~ limestone and sandstone face climbing and then report back with an update.    ",Mar 2012,Jul 13 2017,2
3352,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,1, Just updated with Part Two: Climbing Test (5.7 to 5.11c limestone and basalt sport). Read it on http://aperfectweakness.com/2017/07/14/review-la-sportiva-tx2-approach-shoe/ ,Mar 2012,Aug 9 2017,0
3353,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,2," I did a full day of climbing at Looking Glass Rock in NC wearing TX2s.  It was mostly slab climbing and I thought they did awesome.  The one part where I wished I had actual climbing shoes was on was when we hit ""sundial crack""  would have loved that there was more rubber on teh side walls at that point.  love how stowable they are for packing. ",Jul 2015,Aug 9 2017,1
3354,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,3, love how stowable they are for packing.  Ditto! That was the main draw for me ... I don't normally wear approach shoes with sticky rubber. Super jazzed on this pair. ,Mar 2012,Aug 9 2017,0
3355,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,4, My biggest complaint would be the sizing. I am a 10.5 in everything (with a slightly wide foot) and the 10.5 in these were down right painful. Even after sizing up to 11 it still took awhile for them to break in.  How did you find them durability wise? I got about 6-8 months out of mine before they started to look like this. Admittedly I wore them as street shoes as well but only because there is a limited amount of space in the van! They did well on approaches throughout red rock~ cochise~ zion~ moab~ etc... but they are pretty slick on sandstone now that they are worn out and I've lost my footing a couple times. The rubber isn't quite as sticky as stealth. I feel like if you are the kind of person that wears multiple shoes~ this is the perfect dedicated long C2C approach shoe. If you wear them all the time~ don't expect them to last very long..,Feb 2014,Aug 9 2017,1
3356,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,5, yah.  they certainly are pretty lite weight and that usually doesn't go hand in hand with long term durability.,Jul 2015,Aug 9 2017,0
3357,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,6, 6-8 months is extremely good durability for a lightweight shoe worn daily and in the mountains. The average consensus goal in running shoes is that they last 300-500 miles~ depending on how burly the construction. Most midsoles get pretty shitty after 300 miles. As someone who puts 100-200 miles and 100-200 pitches a month on my shoes~ I would love for a pair of shoes to last more than a few months,Oct 2007,Aug 9 2017,4
3358,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,7, ng C2C approach shoe. If you wear them all the time~ don't expect them to last very long.. Yup~ I bought them just for the Black and walkoffs. My theory on shoes (and ropes) is that you can either have few pairs that you replace often~ or a lot of specialized pairs that you don't replace as often. The latter option allows you to enjoy the benefits of activity-specific products. For example~ I could own one 70m rope and use it for everything and replace it every year for five years. Or I could own five ropes and replace them all once every five years. Same expenditure~ just requires more up-front capital.  (Of course~ I just sold all my ropes to get a 90m Joker that will be my one and only~ but that's because we have limited space moving into the van. No more toprope parties on my cord!),Mar 2012,Aug 9 2017,1
3359,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,8, I totally understand that these are lightweight approach shoes. I was not complaining about their durability just stating how much use I got out of them in my situation. I guess let me rephrase my question about durability to the OP: as an exclusive approach shoe~ how has the durability been? In my pics obviously the worn soles are from wearing everyday but the holes where my pinky toes are are from climbing in them. Have you had any similar wear caused specifically from approaching/climbing/descending? How long have you been using them?,Feb 2014,Aug 9 2017,0
3360,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,9, as an exclusive approach shoe~ how has the durability been? Still in the early stages of testing (a couple days of trail running~ a couple days of single pitch). Weather permitting~ I have two trips to the Weminuche and one to the Black in the next month that should provide more data to respond accurately.,Mar 2012,Aug 9 2017,0
3361,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,10, just published Part 3: Alpine Test. North Face of Storm King.  TL;DR? The TX2's excelled~ but I'm pretty sure now that I got a size too small. I bought a 43 because that's my TC Pro size and didn't realize that these approach shoes don't stretch like climbing shoes do. Anyone else get chafing on their outside ankle bones from wearing these things? http://aperfectweakness.com/2017/07/14/review-la-sportiva-tx2-approach-shoe/,Mar 2012,Aug 22 2017,0

3363,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,12, My two cents: I wore a pair every day for 8mos straight~ they were extraordinarily comfortable~ crazy light~ breathable and grippy. Only downsides were the soles started coming kff at the end~ and the pull straps broke in the first few months. I love and still wearing them (with a bit of glue) but probably won’t buy a second pair unless I end up somewhere with long multis followed by long walkoffs.  As everyday shoes: tx3 or 4 As approach specific/not every day shoes: tx2,May 2018,Mar 20 2019,1
3364,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,13, Any word on durability comparison between the leather and synthetic tx2? Wouldn't resolve the rubber wear but seems more practical for daily use and more durable for scree/cracks,Mar 2016,Mar 27 2019,0
3365,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,14, mmmmm I just looked at the leather Tx2... I think the synthetic version was the whole point of the tx2 to begins with.  the leather version is just a TX3 or 4 with the heel bungee.  As Sawyer mentioned above~ the TX2 is perfect for long multi-pitch with long approaches or walk offs.  they are damn near chacos with toe protection.,Jul 2015,Mar 27 2019,2
3366,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,15, I mean: the leather TX2 is a synthetic TX2 but with a leather upper. Both TX2's are quite different than the TX3 in terms of stack height~ cushion~ thickness of the upper~ laces~ weight~ roominess of the toebox~ stiffness~ fit etc. Both models come in leather~ or synthetic. ,Jan 2014,Mar 27 2019,1
3367,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,16, The leather seems to stretch a little more than the synthetic - I find the leather much more comfortable with a pair that's sized pretty tight. If you're worried about durability though~ go with the TX3. ,Jan 2014,Mar 27 2019,2
3368,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,17, I like them~ but the laces started fraying after a couple wears. The laces are really thin and the materials in the system cause a lot of abrasion. There are spare laces in my pack because it is just a matter of time until I need them.,Sep 2018,Mar 27 2019,0
3369,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,18, Laces are def. weaksauce on the TX2 (TX3 seem fine). I replace them pretty quickly. Best $1.50 upgrade you can make!,Jan 2014,Mar 27 2019,1
3370,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,19, These seemed great in every way in the store until I noticed that same ankle thing (thankfully before buying them).  To me it's pretty clearly a design flaw.  I've owned a whole lot of shoes (I'm 51) and I've never encountered this before.  I've checked various other shoes that I own and any low top shoe I have (approach~ running~ dress shoe~ whatever) all keep about an inch away from that bone (the lateral malleolus).  Bummer~ because these otherwise really ticked all the boxes in terms of light~ packable~ and (reputedly) good climbing performance.  Anybody else encounter this problem? I had the same problem on the TX4s - and have had that issue with a lot of LS trial runners too. I put a superfeet (blue) footbed in there which raised my heel up just enough so it wasn't an issue. ,Feb 2012,Mar 27 2019,0
3371,La Sportiva TX2 Review,1,20, I've had my TX2s for seven months. The tread is doing great. No rubbing around my lateral maleolus~ no heel slipping blisters~ good fit for my narrow/low volume feet~ little support~ low heel drop. I had some qualms about rubbing around the ankle etc when I first got them. But~ like most shoes~ they break in and become very comfy! They are almost all I wear outside of flip flop season. I have been impressed by the mesh's durability (but I'm not trying to jam in them). I sized them comfortably for longer approaches/hiking (used the same criteria as for my trail runners and ended up in the same size as my beloved sportiva Helios SR). They kill it on approaches.  I haven't had a shoe delaminate or wear out in the heel rubber very quickly in a long time. Some durability issues are actually biomechanical issues (don't drag your heels or toes) or storage issues (foot wells of my car stay cooler~ hopefully helps prevent delamination). I haven't owned the TX3 or 4 but sold more of them than any other shoe on the wall while working outdoor retail. Their narrow heel and wide forefoot fit a great variety of feet well. They're also a safe bet. ,Apr 2016,Mar 27 2019,0
3372,La Sportiva TX2 Review,2,0, My favorite “approach” shoe~ in the literal sense - IE I wear them when I know I’m going to need something to approach a rock climb and bring up with me in a pack or on my harness.  For that~ they’re great; super sticky~ secure for tricky approaches~ and very light.  My only compliant is the whole cord system for hooking the shoes together is very flimsy and broke within a few months; I probably stepped on it or something~ which is easy to do because the cord can slip out of its track.,Jul 2014,Mar 27 2019,0
3373,La Sportiva TX2 Review,2,1, I had the same problem on the TX4s - and have had that issue with a lot of LS trial runners too. I put a superfeet (blue) footbed in there which raised my heel up just enough so it wasn't an issue. Thanks~ maybe I'll take the plunge and give that a try. I'd thought of that~ but then was kind of bummed at the idea of taking such awesomely light shoes and adding weight to them. Guessing that the weight of the superfeet is not going to be a deal breaker! ,Aug 2007,Mar 27 2019,1
3374,La Sportiva TX2 Review,2,2, My feet got pretty banged up in TX2s last summer in Tuolumne. Next time I am going to try cutting up milk jugs to use as rock plates.,Jul 2013,Mar 27 2019,0
3375,La Sportiva TX2 Review,2,3, I'm thinking about ordering my first pair of approach shoes using my pro deal and I'm a bit confused on the sizing. I usually wear a size 42-43 for my street shoes~ but size down to 41 for my TC pros and Miuras. I understand that the sizing is a bit dependent on what type of performance I want out of the shoes~ but will it be unbearably tight if I get them to my actual climbing shoe size? If I want them for moderate hiking and approaches to crags~ should I just size them like my street shoes for comfort or will my feet flop around in them?,Apr 2018,Apr 4 2019,0

3389,On Ode to the Metolius Session,1,0," At least in the climbing world~ I was born a boulderer. Destined to slink off into a secret spot in the woods~ pad on back~ to climb without ropes. These days I enjoy roped climbing as well but my first crash pad~ the Metolius Session has recently hit the ripe old age of 2 years old. I figure this is a good age at which to really assess its longevity and give it a proper review as I recently got a second one which will help in comparing.  If you search ""best bouldering pads"" you're bound to come up with list upon list from different websites all of which list the Metolius Session as the ""Bargain Buy""~ ""Beginner Pad""~ or ""Good Value for the Cost""~ and I have to say that I wholeheartedly disagree with that sentiment. In my opinion the session is a high performing light versatile crash pad that while affordable~ will fit well into any boulderer's kit. Coming in at 9 pounds unloaded this pad beats out all but the half pad variety of all other available crash pads besides the mad rock pads which do not cover an equal amount of area. Additionally~ the feature which really drew me to the pad is the 45 degree cut for the middle hinge. This means you don't have to decide between maybe bottoming out in the middle on a classic straight hinge design or having an unwieldy bend from the taco design. Many people have claimed that the foam in the session is particularly soft and wears out fast~ however I have found that for all but the highest of boulders I'm willing to climb the foam is plenty stiff. Additionally it holds up over time~ after two years the overall feel of the foam is only marginally softer than a brand new pad and there are no concerning soft spots of concentrated wear. Working on a ~16 foot tall project yesterday I slipped off the lip and came crashing to the ground in the center of my old pad~ and besides a bruised ego I walked away unscathed. On a particular review I found the author remarking on the low durability of the nylon shell on the session...I'm not sure if the author put their crash pad through a paper shredder or cooked it in the oven or some shit because that is just straight up false. I've dragged~ scraped~ pulled~ and shoved my pad through the many tiny passages through the coarse as grip-tape sandstone at Hunter's Rocks as well as dragged it bushwacking through the PA forests and at two years old there are no tears~ noticeable scratches~ or any signs of wear on the shell besides some dirt and some small slightly fuzzed areas. Standing out as well is the price; at $149.99 MSRP this pad is one of the few that frequently has sales on it~ and combined with coupons~ member discounts~ etc~ you can have a full sized pad for as little as $105 (what I managed to get my second pad for). As a final cherry on top of the good stuff~ who doesn't want a carpet square to wipe off shoes on the pad? It seems gimmicky but its very nice to have if you frequently climb in a damp climate or on dirty rock. Now for what can be improved. Because of the geography of the region I climb~ I have the tendency to find boulders with steep landings. I have found on the steepest of them that the pad will slide on leaves and other debris~ and on slightly less steep areas where the pad doesn't slide I slide on top of the pad while putting shoes on. I believe that this could be solved with some kind of rubberized coating like the recent BD pads have~ however this isn't likely to be a problem most people have frequently. Another area I would change if I could is the closure system. Now depending on what version of the session you're looking at this can be slightly different; however both versions feature an elastic fabric that wraps up and over the bottom right corner of the pad and tensions with a strap to the upper left corner. Not terrible~ but when you're already tired as dirt it can be a damn chore getting the corner pulled over. However this system keeps everything nice and secure inside~ and the newer version of it features some velcro releases that make getting around the corner easier and will allow you to cover up the shoulder straps when the pad is open.  Summary: The Metolius Session is a great pad whether you're new to climbing or have been in the game for a long time. Don't be deterred by the ""bargain"" titles placed on it~ this is absolutely a full sized pad for full sized bouldering. I wouldn't go dropping 25 ft. onto a single session~ but with reasonably sized falls you're not going to bottom out through the angled cut hinge. The shell can stand up to just about anything you through at it~ or throw it into~ and if you have to walk through the dirt in your climbing shoes the carpet square makes a convenient place to wipe them. I have taken countless solo single pad bouldering trips and as long as you're careful a single pad will let you climb a great deal.",Mar 2017,Mar 28 2019,3
3390,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,0, Hello Everyone~Im looking to buy a rope for myself and I'm limited to buying ropes through REI with a gift card. On the website the Maxim Alex Honnold Glider 9.9 has 5 UIAA falls rated but is thicker in diameter than this Edelrid DuoTec 9.6~ which has a rating of 9 UIAA falls. To my understanding the thickness of the rope correlates to its durability as well as how many falls it has rated. Regarding the diameter and fall rating~ these two ropes are almost opposites. Which rope is going to be more durable? I would like to keep this rope as long as possible and and use for a wide range of activities. Cheers.,Jan 2019,Feb 13 2019,0
3391,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,1," Sheath percentage plays a larger role in rope longevity than UIAA falls. UIAA falls is a ""rating"" (and an odd one at that) of the core.",Jan 2017,Feb 13 2019,2
3392,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,2, Ok thank you. I don’t know much about sheath percentage and what is more beneficial. The Edelrid rope was the only one that seemed to have that information.  Core proportion [%]: 60~00 Sheath proportion [%]: 40~00,Jan 2019,Feb 13 2019,0
3393,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,3, That's the crux of the matter. If you plan to do a lot of slingshot toproping~ get more sheath and an overall fatter rope. If you plan to do long alpine routes~ go skinnier. If you plan to redpoint hard stuff~ keep it as light as possible (but don't expect it to last very many seasons...),Aug 2004,Feb 13 2019,2
3394,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,4," Thicker is typically better assuming equal proportions of sheath %.  Don't worry about UIA falls that rating is meaningless to most climbers.    If you're toproping get a thick durable rope.  Searching the forums for ""durable rope"" etc. will turn up good results.   If it's your first rope go cheap.  Expensive ropes do not necessary equal better durability",Apr 2016,Feb 13 2019,1
3395,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,5, That's the crux of the matter. If you plan to do a lot of slingshot toproping~ get more sheath and an overall fatter rope. If you plan to do long alpine routes~ go skinnier. If you plan to redpoint hard stuff~ keep it as light as possible (but don't expect it to last very many seasons...) I’m leaning towards trying to rappel off of routes as much as possible and avoid toprope lowering. But if durability mean’s more weight then I would rather become a stronger climber to accommodate for the weight rather than rely on the weigh loss of a lighter rope in order to redpoint harder routes. ,Jan 2019,Feb 13 2019,0
3396,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,6," There are a lot of factors at play when you talk about different types of ropes.  1. What is its primary utilization going to be? Top-Rope~ Sport Climbing(Lead)~ Rappelling..etc.. 2. I think it's best to try and target a rope based off of the things you want to do with it. 3. How much use are you going to get out of it? Are you a weekend warrior? Are you going to use it in the gym and outside or just outside only?  For example~ I have an Edelweiss 9.8 60m rope. I primarily use this rope for leading indoors and outdoors~ and some occasions for a Top-Rope outside. In my opinion this is a ""middle of the road"" type rope~ its thick enough to handle some Top-Rope routes and light enough for me to handle the majority of sport routes I encounter. It's not dry treated~ so I make sure it doesn't get wet.  To maintain the life of the rope~ I make sure to inspect it after I take outside because the inevitable of it running over rocks will ""weather"" the rope~ it's just a fact. The rope is only durable if you take care of it~ i.e.- keeping it in a rope bag~ resting the rope after big falls~ cleaning the rope after a couples days of outside climbing use(dirt and aluminum build up within the fibers of the rope).  I would say that BOTH UIAA ratings and thickness of the rope are important for determining what you should buy~ but keep in mind other factors too and you will have a rope that can meet all your needs.  Another good idea is to read read read~ you can never go wrong with researching~ googling or Youtube(ing) companies or equipment providers who provide info on ropes and their uses. Even research what UIAA means and how they determine those fall ratings!  Best of luck! ",Feb 2018,Feb 13 2019,1
3397,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,7, I’m planning to mostly lead and rappel off routes. This will be my first climbing rope that I have bought but having lived on a sailboat for a couple of years and crossing the Atlantic~ it will not be the first rope I have bought. That being said I’ve always kept a close eye on the environments my ropes have been used in and on top of that I have a gift card for this purchase so I would like to get a rope with more features if possible. ,Jan 2019,Feb 13 2019,0
3398,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,8, Yeah that isn't true.  Beefy hard wearing rope has a thicker sheath percentage. UIAA falls is not something you will ever experience and is kind of a bunk number.  The number I pay most attention to is Impact force~ the force the fall will inflict on your body.  ,Jul 2015,Feb 13 2019,1
3399,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,9, Yeah that isn't true.  Beefy hard wearing rope has a thicker sheath percentage. UIAA falls is not something you will ever experience and is kind of a bunk number.  The number I pay most attention to is Impact force~ the force the fall will inflict on your body.   Ok the impact force is half a kilonewton less on the Edelrid rope than the Maxim rope. I understand that is for a softer catch. As for the UIAA falls I realize that I will never experience fall factor of 1.77 but it makes sense to me that if a rope can take more of those high factor falls than another rope then it sounds like it is more durable in the long run and can take more of a beating. Is that true?,Jan 2019,Feb 14 2019,1
3400,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,10, Thank you for your detailed response. I plan to mostly sport climb and rappel off routes. I am very soon going to transition to multi pitch sport routes and eventually in the future trad routes. I do plan on using it weekly outdoors and maybe on very rare occasions I would bring it to the gym due to the convenience factor. I understand that when outdoor climbing the wear from running over rocks is inevitable. I do intend to care for the rope with as many different practices as I can. Both of these rope are dry treated but I will try too clean them every number of outdoor sessions. As for research I have messaged REI this question and they referred me to the manufacturers . . . I own and have read the Mountianeering Freedom of the Hills book and watched many YouTube videos. And now I am trying this avenue. Maybe with this information you might be able to give me some more insights as to what rope I should choose?? Thanks so much.,Jan 2019,Feb 14 2019,0
3401,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,11, Ok the impact force is half a kilonewton less on the Edelrid rope than the Maxim rope. I understand that is for a softer catch.

Is that true? It sounds like it should be true~ but isn't. The UIAA test is a series of extremely brutal falls with hardly any rest in between. A person would never~ ever do that~ the first fall would probably make you shit your pants. ,Jul 2015,Feb 14 2019,2
3402,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,12, More falls means your core is going to be more durable~ and generally indicates a higher core %. A more durable core means it will be longer before your rope becomes squishy (when you can bend your rope without a twist which indicates the core is damaged) and also means it will retain its elasticity for longer. This usually comes at the cost of less sheath~ however~ which will make your rope less resistance to abrasion~ which is bad for vertical and low angle terrain~ but doesn't matter quite as much on steep overhanging terrain.  If this is your first rope~ I would get something with a high sheath % around 9.8mm because you're going to beat the shit out of your rope until you learn how to take better care of it. Especially if you're going to be doing a lot of TRing and/or sport climbing on low angle or vertical terrain. If you climb a lot of steep sport and you're falling a bunch~ you're probably going to get squishy sections before you get a coreshot so I would get a second line that has a higher fall rating and lower impact force (which typically indicates a higher core %) to be used exclusively for steep sport climbing. I know buying a second rope can be hard to swallow financially~ but having two ropes for two different purposes will give you a lot more durability~ which will save you money in the long run.,May 2014,Feb 14 2019,1
3403,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,13, I agree with everything Eli said....BUT~ that BD rope is a screaming good deal~ and it is BD's burliest rope.  Anyway~ all BD ropes are 25% off at Backcountry. I believe that Black Diamond ropes are made by Roca~ don't quote me on that though. You can get a 60M for $120!!! ,Jul 2015,Feb 14 2019,1
3404,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,14, meh - he's relegated to REI for the gift card use there are better deals at epic tv shop for ropes or when campsaver has a sale/coupon combo. You can get a double dry 70m for the price of that BD 70m but for the OP~ we need to recommend REI sales/ropes: seeing as REI doesn't price match~ I don't see any deals currently. OP~ you should wait until the next REI sale~ if you can. Best bet is a coupon that works on the outlet pricing... If you HAVE to buy now~ at least this comes with a cool rope bag: https://www.rei.com/rei-garage/product/130456/edelrid-ceuze-98mm-x-60m-non-dry-rope-and-caddy-light-rope-bag-package ,Oct 2010,Feb 14 2019,0

Maybe with this information you might be able to give me some more insights as to what rope I should choose?? Thanks so much. Good! Due diligence is key to finding the right product for the right price and right application. From what I gather from the other posters and from you~ breaking into multi-pitch and trad later on~ I think you couldn't go wrong with a 70m rope. 70m will provide you enough length for rappels and enough length for longer pitches with out having to break a pitch into two(depending on where you plan to climb). ,Feb 2018,Feb 14 2019,0
3407,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,17," I feel like each time I purchase a rope~ I learn more: more about what I want out of my next rope and what to look for.  e.g. - weight vs diameter. I recently purchased a Beal Tiger 10.0mm - it weighs 61g/m~ which is less than many 9.8s and even some 9.5-9.6 ropes.  do you really want a ""skinny"" rope or a lightweight rope?  Buy what's on sale and then you'll have more $ to put towards other items~ and save towards your next rope~ which you'll then have a better idea of what you want. Its nice to have a lighter 70m for multipitch vs a beefier 60m for cragging~ etc",Oct 2010,Feb 14 2019,1
3408,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,18, the problem is the grams/meter thing is also kinda bogus. there was recently a thread about the triple rated ropes and the beal opera which supposedly weights 48g/m was much closer to 55 or so in real life. they get to measure weight *after* the rope has been stretched a little bit.,Sep 2016,Feb 14 2019,1
3409,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,19, I've owned three Maxim Gliders and another Maxim with the same sheath and while I love the handling of the rope they are by far the least durable ropes I have ever owned.  They tout the sheath being more wear resistant but in my experience it is the opposite.  The tightness of the weave of the sheath results in it being more susceptible to damage.  Think about how hard it is to cut a rope in two without any tension in it versus pulling the rope taut to be able to cut it. ,Aug 2012,Feb 14 2019,0
3410,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,1,20, I dunno if REI carries edelrid ropes but if they do I would highly recommend the 9.8mm boa (or the eco boa that is made from shorter yarns that would otherwise be wasted). That was my first rope and she's about to start her 6th year~ still going strong~ although I no longer use it for trad climbing because it's lost a small amount of its elasticity. ,May 2014,Feb 14 2019,1
3411,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,2,0, You are overestimating how long this rope will last you~ even with the best of care. And overthinking the effect the differences in rope specs will make on your enjoyment and use of the product.. Impact forces are important~ to an extent. But the conditions under which the impact forces are tested do not replicate the conditions encountered in an average climbing fall~ and factors such as rope drag~ terrain~ how many draws are clipped~ how much rope is out~ and how far you fall~ will make a difference of 1kN in the rated impact force completely irrelevant. So I look for a rope that is in the 6.5-7.5 impact force rate for sport climbing~ but I wouldn't refuse to climb on a rope that is 7.5-8.8 kN impact force. Your weight also matters. You might choose a rope with smaller dynamic elongation if you are heavier~ but I prefer dynamic elongation about 30% or more. And while dynamic elongation and Impact force are related~ they don't have a one-to-one correspondence. You can find ropes out there that have the same impact force rating~ but one has dynamic elongation of 25%~ and the other one is 35%. The bottom line is that all dynamic ropes currently on the market work pretty well. And a lot comes to personal preference of how the rope feels/handles. I don't care that Sterling is a very highly rated company that makes excellent product that a lot of people really like. I'll go with Bluewater~ PMI/Trango~ Beal~ Edelrid~ Mammut~ Edelweiss~ Black Diamond~ in approximately that order~ before I would pick up a Sterling rope for the same sale price. Unfortunately~ I have to belay on a Sterling regularly~ because some of my partners like them. :),Mar 2011,Feb 14 2019,3
3412,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,2,1, Between those two choices... id picm which color i liked more. Both brands are solid~ maxims last forever. So do edelrid ropes.  The maxim will be very stiff. The weight difference is negligible. ,Sep 2009,Feb 14 2019,0

But if durability mean’s more weight then I would rather become a stronger climber to accommodate for the weight rather than rely on the weigh loss of a lighter rope in order to redpoint harder routes.  If you're sport climbing~ you shouldnt ever be rappelling. The only time is when the rope is running over a dangerously sharp edge~ or if the anchor is done poorly and are too far apart where it will twist your rope when lowering. Not sure why new climbers have in their head that they should be rapping on a single pitch climb. Is that in some gumbie manual somewhere? If so~ that needs to be burned.  Top Rope climb through YOUR OWN GEAR~ lower from the climb off the FIXED GEAR. You should learn how to rappel~ and then never do it unless it's absolutely critical~ or you get into multipitch climbing. There's more accidents due to rappelling than any other reason in the entire field of climbing~ including mountaineering. That should be enough of a reason to avoid it. Plus~ cleaning a route on a rapp is 10x harder than being lowered.,Sep 2017,Feb 19 2019,5

3415,Rope Diameter vs UIAA Falls,2,4, lots of sound advice here on a first rope purchase. one thing not discussed thus far is the ease of belaying with various ropes and their relationship to your belay device. a softer sheath is much easier to handle in a tube type device than a stiff one~ especially if your belayer is relatively inexperienced. like wise a soft rope is easier to rap on than a stiff one. with a grigri~ a stiffer rope is fine and they do slide more easily over rock and through biners. dry treated ropes are also slicker than nondry~ regardless of flexibility. it will take you a few years to zero in on your own preferences~ from gear to climbs you enjoy most. it's a great ride. ,Aug 2010,Feb 19 2019,2

I really enjoyed climbing with the Reactor...eventhough I still prefer my Grivel Tech Machine~ haha!,Mar 2018,Mar 4 2019,0
3447,How good is the new Black Diamond Reactor?,1,6, Wasn’t impressed. The offset handle shape doesn’t work when using the upper grip. It gets in the way with the heel of your hand. The new ergonomic handle shape works a lot better. The swing I found meh. Best so far I think is Grivel master alloy and Ergonomic with pur ice pick,Jan 2016,Mar 5 2019,1
3448,How good is the new Black Diamond Reactor?,1,7, Just my two cents; I thought that the handle shape would be a nuisance. I figured I’d try them out for a few laps but I was a skeptic. The way the sizing insert works means that there is a bit more material and a less rounded shape on the back side of it. Honestly never noticed it though. Really nice easy natural swing for me. Not as much wrist flick as x-dreams. Haven’t had recent experience with Nomics so I can’t compare there. I think ice tool choice really comes down to matching the right tool for your swing so festivals are great to demo gear. I absolutely loved them after a few laps and I think I’ll be getting a pair. ,Feb 2019,Mar 5 2019,2

3450,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,0, Curious if anybody has tried a few sat com devices out there and what their thoughts were? Im looking at getting either a spot~ or a garmin inreach device. I heard a few horror stories about the spot not working when the time came for it to perform its job. Just curious if anyone has had this happen to them with either device~ and if anyone had any recomendations~ even if it is some other brand. Thanks!,Apr 2013,Mar 6 2019,0
3451,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,1, I have an inReach mini - it works great~ and has 2-way texting via satellite so you can always get a message out. I originally bought it for paragliding tracking and SOS options~ but it was just used for a winter week in Yellowstone and allowed for daily texting~ since service is thin in the Lamar Valley. Not sure it's worth paying the monthly access fee for casual use ($15-$20 per month)~ but if you're going to bother with one~ I'd definitely go with the inReach. I can't speak to Spot's reliability (or lack thereof)~ but the inReach has always been on point~ the live tracking is great~ and the 2-way texting is a big bonus.,Apr 2010,Mar 7 2019,1
3452,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,2, I have the Garmin inReach. It's worked for me but I haven't been anywhere super remote (Sierra Nevada mostly). My main comment is to make sure you turn it on and have it connect to satellites somewhere with open exposure to the sky prior to even getting to the trailhead. I've found that if I forget to turn it on and I'm out in the backcountry sometimes it's taken awhile to gain connection to satellites.,Feb 2012,Mar 7 2019,1
3453,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,3, I was the rep for inReach before (and a bit after) they were bought by Garmin.  I have used quite a few different devices and inReach is still the best.  subscription kind of sucks but it is worth it - plus~ it's pretty flexible and very reliable.  I have used it all over the world with great success (borat accent!),Feb 2014,Mar 7 2019,3
3454,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,4, InReach works well. Sometimes it takes a while to send/receive messages but it works everywhere.,Oct 2018,Mar 7 2019,0
3455,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,5, I'll be buying an inReach Mini as soon as possible. The Spot two-way unit is complete garbage.,Jan 2014,Mar 7 2019,1
3456,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,6, +1 for the inreach. In an emergency~ you really want to be able to tell them what's going on. If you're like me~ you'll end up using the texting a lot casually too. We had a non-emergency situation with a wildfire in the wind rivers that broke out near the trailhead a few hours after we embarked. We were able to get updates on the fire~ enjoy our trip~ and know that the fire was out and it was safe to go back to the trailhead at the end of our trip. Without the inreach~ we might have had quite an epic and miserable trip.,Nov 2013,Mar 7 2019,0
3457,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,7, +2 for inreach. used on an expedition to Aconcagua to keep the family updated via texts.,Dec 2014,Mar 7 2019,0
3458,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,8, A major advantage of the InReach is that it uses the Iridium satellite network~ which is more robust than the Globalstar network used by Spot. The problem with Spot is that a message can only be transmitted if a Globalstar satellite is in view of both the Spot device and a Globalstar ground station at the same time. Depending on your location or view of the sky such a satellite may never appear~ no matter how long you wait. (That's why Spot doesn't work at high latitudes or in mid-ocean). The Iridium system doesn't have the same limitation~ because Iridium satellites can relay messages between themselves. All you need is an Iridium satellite to be in view of your InReach device. There are 60+ Iridium satellites in various orbits~ so even if your view of the sky is somewhat limited chances are that one will come into view at some point. You may have to wait but rarely more than 10-15 minutes or so.,Jul 2003,Mar 7 2019,3
3459,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,9, +3 for InReach.  Just used it on a trip to Kathdin and it worked great. Family was able to track our progress and I was able to send them preset messages that we were safe every night. Luckily I didn't have to test the SOS feature. ,Apr 2018,Mar 7 2019,0

3469,2 Way Satelite Communicator,1,19, This topic is so heavily one sided~ that I went ahead and bought the inreach mini. Every where i look~ it seems to be the favored devoce hands down. Plus i love the fact that you can have a freedom plan~ no commitment~ only downside i seem to notice is the 50hr battery life for tracking but~ you dont really need that feature going on. From what ive read~ test it~ turn it off~ turn it on if you absolutely need it to save battery if thats what your worried about. Ill be back to give my two cents on the thing after i take it out and give her a test run. Thanks all who chipped in...,Apr 2013,Mar 7 2019,2

3481,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,0," after 5+ years using the original ocun crack glove design~ I finally got my first pair of the ""new"" design. TLDR: the redesign is terrible. 1) they fingers holes are cut way too small--what were they thinking? they cut same size hole for the thumb as the index finger!!! 1) sizing is way off-- I used to be a large. The wrist is now too small on a large~ but the whole glove is too baggy in an XL. 3) they made the wrist strap shorter. 4) the rubber they added over the wrist area makes the gloves too bulky. 5) the older gloves had a non rubberized area over the part of the hand that needed the most flexibility. The new gloves moved that area to the middle of the glove!?!? Very sad that they screwed up a design that worked well. If anyone has the older style glove in size large~ please contact me~ I will happily buy them.",Sep 2013,Oct 28 2018,1
3482,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,1, Finger holes are on the small side~ but I have been using them for two years without issue. I’m sorry you preferred the old model~ but they still get the job done and they are still better than the OR gloves. It looks like Barrabes still carries the old style:https://m.barrabes.com/en/ocun-crack-gloves/p-11666?idvariedad=42081&opt=d&utm_source=Google.eeuu&utm_medium=Shopping&utm_campaign=producto&gclid=CjwKCAjwvNXeBRAjEiwAjqYhFoeBrr7l0Vlex3OSRFYy8drp3slnQ52JRSrS7YmFr5BmDdsmWckZzBoCXckQAvD_BwE,Jun 2016,Oct 28 2018,0
3483,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,2, They had a design that worked~ yet managed to ruin it in a redesign. That's what's so frustrating.  I don't think the person who redesigned the gloves has ever crack cimbed- it has bulk in all the wrong places. ,Sep 2013,Oct 29 2018,1

3485,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,4, They stretch a lot~ so just idk...climb more crack? oh~ and gloves are aid,Mar 2016,Oct 29 2018,19
3486,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,5, I blew through the old models after a month of crack climbing in Liming~ China. The hole where the wrist-strap threaded through the rubber tore out~ rendering that glove useless. The leather between the rubber and the velcro ripped away. The velcro on the wrist-strap frayed to the point that every time I put my hand in a crack it detached from the velcro on the glove. All of these issues have been addressed with the new gloves. If I'm climbing tight hands or fingers then I don't wear gloves because of the bulk. If I'm doing laps on perfect hand cracks then the new gloves are awesome. It's too bad your particular issues make them unusable for you.,Aug 2010,Oct 29 2018,8
3487,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,6," They do seem to be more tightly ""fitted""~ but I am still able to wear the same size with no problems. I haven't noticed any other significant performance problems personally.... the strap design on the previous versions was really terrible. The strap was too long for my wrist size and it wrapped the wrong way for the most-used hand jam type - thumbs up. The straps were consequently always being peeled back by the crack with every jam. It got to the point that the velcro'd anchor end was literally being peeled back and released during hand jamming~ rendering the glove useless. It got to the point for me where the gloves are still in perfectly useable condition but the anchor strap on my dominant hand glove is separating from the velcro strip and is permanently curled back so much that I can't get it to secure anymore. The new strap design solves this silly oversight design~ but I do agree that the method of securing the strap is a bit tricky to do oneself with one hand.  Edited to add: I agree with Nate Ball^^^ in almost everything he said.",Mar 2007,Oct 29 2018,0

3490,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,9, Same thing happened to my new model after 2 years of pretty heavy use. I had been reinforcing with tape~ but having to fix them mid climb in an OW today was the last straw. Using tape on your gloves is kinda ridiculous. Still like them though.

3491,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,10, Might not be what you want to hear~ but I’d say just pick up the OR ones. I think they’re a better product anyway. Much less bulky~ but the extra tape wrap at the wrist you describe is pretty key with them. ,Oct 2007,Oct 30 2018,0
3492,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,11, Tape still works and you can make gloves however you want... edit: back to OP - sorry for the drift.

3498,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,17, I have fat hands and I think they are fine. They are leather/fake leather and stretch a bunch in the first 300-400 ft of crack to be really comfy.

3499,terrible ocun crack glove re-design,1,18, Disclaimer: Never had the old ones. But they're probably not as good as the new ones. I like that the strap is covered by the rubber. Have you ever climbed a hand crack with Velcro shoes~ Velcro gets destroyed. So that seems like an upgrade.  As for the bit with less rubber(flexible bit?)~ I would imagine that it's cosmetic or bulk reduction as the hand doesn't flex there. Maybe if it was at the knuckles~ but then it would probably wear fast with thin hand cracks.  Cut the excess rubber~ enlarge the finger holes~ or design and sell your own! There isn't enough competition in the crack glove industry.,Feb 2016,Mar 6 2019,0

3503,Kayland Mountaineering Boots,1,0, I recently went through the process of getting a set of 3 season mountaineering boots and ended up settling on a pair of Kaylands. These don't seem to be very popular in the US and I ended up getting them for a steal through Sierra Trading Post ($189). Kayland is an Italian company that seems to sell mostly into the UK and Europe - that's where I found a small amount of info on them. One of the struggles was getting info on these boots - since they're not extremely popular there are very few reviews out there from folks who have actually gotten their hands on them. I ended up ordering in 4 different pairs of the Kaylands to compare: -Apex Plus GTX (don't have photos of these~ sorry) - $150 on STP -Apex GTX (the pair that I'm keeping) - $180 on STP -Apex Rock - $200 on STP -Cross Mountain - $150 Overall I will say this - Kayland puts out a product that is absolutely on par with Sportiva~ Scarpa et al. Just because they aren't very popular in the US doesn't mean they are 2nd rate~ fit and finish as as good or better than all other brands I tried.Apex Plus GTX: I don't have photos of these~ but here's a stock photo:,Sep 2017,Nov 15 2018,3

3513,Kayland Mountaineering Boots,1,10, I have a pair of Aku (Serai boot) and Kayland (mid approach forget name; update soon.) The Aku was a dream from day one. Amazing! The Kayland are nice too but~ have zero padding in the heal. In fact~ it's hard as a rock back there. That said~ and after some blisters to toughen up me heals~ I've grown to like them. They are tough and grip the rock very well~ unlike my Garmont (name coming soon.)  That leads into a side note~ I also have a pair of Garmont; they are a bit wide for me and the particular choice of Vibram rubber was a crappy one but~ seem well made otherwise. I'll update model and rubber soon. I'll wear the soles out soon (very thin soles) and get them re-soled. ,Feb 2016,Dec 17 2018,0
3514,Kayland Mountaineering Boots,1,11, I like the kayland boots I’ve tried.  Unfortunately I bought something else that’s never been as good as I remember the demo kaylands to be.   As far as lace pressure.  A common trick against lace bite on ice hockey skates is to make sure the laces are routed from the outside in - not inside out.  This made a huge difference in my lace bite problem and you lace up ice boots similar to the way you  lace up hockey skates. Maybe try changing up the lacing direction if that’s the only hotspot in otherwise well fitting boots.  Lacing outside in pulls the boot in closed instead of just cranking down on the tongue.  ,Aug 2009,Dec 31 2018,1

3519,Rab Latok Mountain 2 FR summit tent,1,0, I have been looking for a lightweight single wall summit tent for some time~ and finally after a good bit of research settled on the Rab Latok Mountain 2. My main reasoning for choosing this tent was the size (just enough extra room over the Mountain Hardwear Direkt 2 and the MSR Advance Pro 2) as well as it being made from EVent fabric. I have now used it once~ for two nights~ and wanted to give my initial impressions here.  The tent seems super well made~ with no extra details or frills. The weight comes in at just over 4lbs~ which for me seems pretty reasonable. The room inside is noticeably bigger than other summit/bivy tents that I have slept in~ specifically the Direkt 2 which seemed to have no extra room to roll over. Two average size people in the Rab fit well~ with room for a little gear and you can sit up fully in the middle. Tie downs seem sturdy and able to withstand a pretty good storm when properly guyed out. I have experienced condensation in summit tents before and expected some here as well~ but both mornings we awoke with zero water on the walls of the tent. This could in part be due to the EVent~ but in full disclosure we did have the door vented a good couple inches all night due to mellow temps.  I'm looking forward to spending more nights in this tent~ am very happy with it overall~ and would certainly recommend it for anybody looking for something similar. ,Mar 2014,May 6 2018,1
3520,Rab Latok Mountain 2 FR summit tent,1,1, the problem i have with rab latok mountain 2 tent is that it is very cold inside~ i feel like there is no barrier between me inside the tent and outside~ for example if outside temperature is -10 c inside would be -8~ probably this is because of the high breath-ability of the event wall~ unlike nylon wall tents ~ nylon wall will keep inside tent much warmer and you control the condensation via available vents.  I used the tent twice in winter mountaineering in an 3600 meter mountain~ we camped at altitude 3000 meter. and I still get a lot of ,Feb 2019,Feb 27 2019,0
3521,La Sportiva Trango Tower Extremes~ any thoughts?,1,0, Hello folks~ has anyone gotten their hands on some of those fine super car lookin boots and drove them yet? I would love some feedback on these as they seem to be perfect for the north cascades. I have also been thinking about the Mammut nordwand light mid gtx boots as they also seem that they would perform well. I just have never tried them on and have an old pair of trangos that have held up but are not super waterproof.,Aug 2016,Dec 4 2018,0
3522,La Sportiva Trango Tower Extremes~ any thoughts?,1,1, Bump for curiosity as well. The Trango ice cubes have consistent negative reviews all over the inter webs. The extremes looks promising though without those wimpy plastic eyelets...,Jun 2011,Jan 3 2019,1
3523,La Sportiva Trango Tower Extremes~ any thoughts?,1,2, I bought a pair a few months ago from the LS shop in Boulder. They feel pretty solid so far. Was originally looking at the Nepal Cubes~ but was attracted by the lower weight. The guys in the shop figured that the extremes would be perfect for 1-day missions in CO in winter. I've been out in them a few times now. I got mine a little big and typically wear them with a thin wool liner and a pair of mountaineering socks. I've been out on St. Mary's Glacier with them twice~ hiked up and down Square Top Mountain with them~ and used them in Guanella Pass this past weekend in a variety of conditions~ from 5F and -15F windchill to 25F and calm and have been pretty comfortable in them throughout warmth wise. Haven't had any issues with water resistance~ but also haven't really been in conditions that would stretch that super far. Postholing in thigh deep snow with OR Crocs over them was totally fine. Durability over the Trango Ice Cubes was definitely a big selling point for me. I think you do lose a little bit of the dexterity that comes from that lighter and more flexible design~ but since I was looking for a long term and multipurpose solution~ I'm fine giving up some of that sensitivity. The synthetic honey-comb looking sections on the sides seem really solid~ as do the leather eyelets and metal hooks for the laces. I have noticed some scratches on the rand already~ but that's probably more do to being a novice crampon user than anything else.  I've done a little walking around with them in crampons~ Petzl Sarkens~ and they have been doing fine. Fit is pretty reasonable as far as I can tell. I haven't used them for any technical climbing yet~ but should be getting on some ice tomorrow evening and can update if you're interested.  I've never been to the PNW~ so I can't really comment on how that compares to their use here. CO is obviously drier. With the double sock system~ my feet have stayed pretty happy. Like all mountain boots~ long walks on mostly flat terrain can be a bit of a pain. They're more flexible than some~ sure~ but they're still pretty darn stiff.  Wavie Dave~ since you're in Boulder~ I would definitely recommend going to the shop to check them out.,Apr 2018,Jan 24 2019,2

3526,La Sportiva Trango Tower Extremes~ any thoughts?,1,5, Mine are sadly too big. Got heel lift while climbing~ so can't really comment on how good they would be for that if the fit works for you. I did recently try on a pair of Mont Blanc Pro's while looking for replacements~ and I would agree with Sterling Falconer that they to be in the same overall class of boot. If you happen to want a pair in 46.5 EU~ I'll probably be posting them on here tonight.,Apr 2018,Feb 6 2019,0
3527,La Sportiva Trango Tower Extremes~ any thoughts?,1,6," Hi Christian~ I think it depends on what you want to use the boots for in the North Cascades.  I think of this boot as more of an ice/mixed cragging boot~ with great ankle flexibility to make the weird moves necessary on funky icy and mixed.  I almost pulled the trigger on these boots~ but decided in the end that I wanted more of an ""all-mountain"" boot~ so I got the G5 which is much warmer~ has more ankle support (nice for long sections of moderate alpine ice)~ and has the integrated gaiter.  The G5s are great for routes like Mt Baker - North Ridge or Mt Rainier - Liberty Ridge.  I think you could do either of those routes in the Trango Tower Extremes~ but they aren't optimal for mountaineering in my opinion.  ",Jun 2013,Feb 6 2019,1

But it sounds like the tte's might be too similar to what I already have so Ive been thinking of getting a super gaiter boot for alpine ice stuff and having a boot like the zodic techs for rock stuff.",Aug 2016,Feb 16 2019,0

3531,Patagonia Ascentionist 40 vs. TNF Phantom 38,8,0, Looking for a technical Ice/alpine pack~ something that can be low-profile enough to not get in the way but also carries well enough to haul rope/rack/tools etc. some camera equipment and potentially gear for overnight missions. I'm really torn between the two~ the Patagonia seems a little more lightweight and low-profile~ but the North Face Phantom has a few nice features lacking on the Ascentionist (sleeves for tool picks~ fully removable brain and waistbelt) and seems like it might handle loads a bit better~ which is important for that bulky~ heavy camera equipment. Anyone have any experience with either? Thoughts~ impressions~ full reviews all appreciated.,Aug 2015,Jan 31 2019,0
3532,Patagonia Ascentionist 40 vs. TNF Phantom 38,8,1, You may want to give the Mountain Equipment Tupilak Pack a look.  I don't own one~ but I looked into one hard at the beginning of the season and they get phenomenal reviews.  Super lightweight~ on-route alpine packs.  If comfort is more what you're looking for~ take a look at Osprey's new Mutant series.  Some people love the Ascensionist Pack~ and some hate it.   I ended up going with an Arc'teryx Alpha FL 30 for an on-route winter alpine pack and so far~ it's been great.  Arc'teryx just dropped their brand new Alpha AR 35 Pack. If I was doing anything where I was hauling more gear ie: stove~ tent~ sleeping bag~ etc. on technical routes~ I'd probably order a Tupilak.,Mar 2011,Jan 31 2019,1
3533,Patagonia Ascentionist 40 vs. TNF Phantom 38,8,2, I was in this boat not too long ago~ looking for a good technical alpine pack. I can't really stress fit enough. A pack can have all the nicest features and the lowest weight~ but if it doesn't fit you well~ you'll still be miserable in it.  I looked at several packs:  Patagonia Ascensionist~ TNF Cobra~ Arc'T Alpha FL~ Gregory Alpinisto~ Osprey Variant~ Osprey Mutant~ Black Diamond Mission~ and Black Diamond Speed.  The Speed quite simply fit me the best. Alpine packs typically don't have adjustable torso length (weight)~ but the BD fits my back perfectly~ so that's what I went with. Loaded it up with 30 lbs in the store and carried it around for about half an hour while I looked at other stuff just to make sure. Highly recommend trying stuff on with weight if you can~ whether that means ordering several packs and then returning~ or finding a store that has a good selection.   I do have some other general thoughts though. I thought I would really like the Ascensionist~ but I didn't really like the closure system or the fact that it's less strippable than other packs. I can get the BD speed down to just a tube with some shoulder straps if I want~ and I like that flexibility. I think you're kind of hitting on that idea noticing that the Phantom has a removable waist and brain.,Apr 2018,Feb 1 2019,2
3534,Patagonia Ascentionist 40 vs. TNF Phantom 38,8,3, I use the BD Mission 45 for most climbing use. It pretty big for a 45l in my opinion but the strippable design and removable brain is super nice. If you plan to do more hard climbing with a pack on~ maybe get the 35 or a speed. If you carrying it mostly on approaches~ occasionally over night I highly recommend. ,Apr 2017,Feb 5 2019,0
3535,Patagonia Ascentionist 40 vs. TNF Phantom 38,8,4, I was debating the same~ since these packs are at a steep discount on backcountry.  Looking at both and reading reviews both packs have drawbacks.3rd option I feel cilo gear 30 guide is worth the extra money for me.,Aug 2018,Feb 9 2019,1

3561,Friend vrs camalot,1,1, I bought a set of .5-3 about a month ago and like them as they can go with the C4's pretty well as a  double rack. Some things I have noticed are: The extendable slings on the friends are nice~ but not long enough to be the full extension most of the time. The friends all feel lighter~ although I have not checked the actual stats to confirm~ but that can be really nice if its something that concerns you. The individual lobes are all wider on the friends for more friction.   They seem to fit slightly different placements that the C4's will. I believe the heads are a little wider on the friends~ so that could be why they fit slightly different in some areas. I personally like the way the trigger feels on the friends more than the C4. The triggers are bent a little more and it feels better to grab onto. As to which is better~ I think they are equal~ just different. If you can find a cheap set they are worth looking into. Like I mentioned~ I've only had my set for about a month but I don't have any complaints.,Apr 2016,Apr 23 2018,8
3562,Friend vrs camalot,1,2, The new Friends are lighter than C4s.  They are between the Ultralights and regular C4s.  I used to like that the Friends were slightly different in size but~ now they are not.  It was good to have them as slightly different sized cams from C4s~  now not so much.,Feb 2003,Apr 23 2018,2
3563,Friend vrs camalot,1,3," That is like asking what is better - a ford or a chevy?  For the camalot vs friend debate it comes down to personal preference and there is no right or wrong answer. My rack is 90% BD so I buy more BDs because I know the colors and sizes and I have grown accustomed to them. Sambo who posted above has lots of comments with ""I feel like"" or ""I believe"" and ""They seem"". None of this is concrete and not worth anything in a hard comparison. There are about 1000 threads on here comparing cams so I recommend searching through those for more beta on this.  Just know that BD C4s are the gold standard for cams. ",Aug 2012,Apr 23 2018,3

3572,Friend vrs camalot,1,12, Well to get back from the thread drift~ I will say that the new friends are really great cams and~ as far as I’m concerned~ much better than C4’s. They tick all the boxes for what people want for the most part.They are almost as light in the hand as an ultralight C4~ has them both on my harness yesterday~ but they don’t have the limited lifespan like the ultralights.  They have a thumbloop which seems to be very important to some~ I don’t care either way~ I have owned dragons for years so I’m used to the lack of a thumbloop. The extendable sling isn’t quite as long as the dragon~ but it does give you the ability to adjust length to get a biner that might be loaded on an edge off said edge.  The lobes are grippy like the lobes on Dragon 2’s and inspire confidence when you place them.  I’m interested in long term longevity~ and I’ll find out in years to come. C4’s are long lasting for sure~ as are Dragons~ so if these last the same~ they are contender for one of the best cams.  ,Mar 2014,Apr 25 2018,2
3573,Friend vrs camalot,1,13, I am a big fan of the new Friends for all of the reasons people have already mentioned. I will say that one thing I have noticed (user error?..) is that the Friends seem harder to clean than the BD cams. I initially attributed this to the non-anodized lobes being stickier~ but someone above mentioned they may be slightly bigger than the equivalent C4's (which I used for years and still use)~ so maybe I am over camming them more frequently? This observation does not change my opinion on the cams at all~ and I still reach for them first~ but since we're picking nits...,Mar 2010,Apr 25 2018,0

3580,Friend vrs camalot,1,20, Was.  Gold standard is a term for the bar/standard that everyone else is measured against.  Its the most recognizable of the good designs~ not necessarily that it is the absolute best.  In that regard BD's are clearly the gold standard in cams.  1) Guide books (most notably Indian Creek) are switching or have switched to using Camalot sizes in the gear descriptions~ no longer crack size or Friend size.  2) Most MP.com cam discussions are comparing some cam against the BD (Totems vs. BD~ Dragon's vs. BD~ etc.) case in point this thread.  3) WC moved towards the BD design~ not the other way around. 4) BD's current Camelot design have just been around a lot longer than most other current designs (Yes I know original friends came out way before Camelots~ I'm talking about current gen C4 Camelot design vs. current gen Friend/Totem/Dragon/etc. design).  5) I thought I saw a statistic that Camelots have more market share than all other cams combined.  That could be made up but take a walk around any cliff at Indian Creek and its hard to argue.,Jan 2009,Apr 25 2018,9

3586,Friend vrs camalot,2,5, Owning a single rack of both~ I feel the WC's are a small incremental improvement upon the C4.  Would the small differences justify unloading all my C4's to buy new WC's?  Nah~ they aren't that different. If the next design is of BD origin~ chances are I'll spring for those instead~ providing I don't run into and/or fall in love with totems along the way.  Sometimes new products are innovative and revolutionary~ other times they are iterative and nuanced.  I don't think that the latter necessarily justifies jumping ship~ whether that's because of financial factors~ brand loyalty~ etc...

3599,Friend vrs camalot,2,18, If your not tied to a thumb loop~ i feel the dmm dragon cams are a significant upgrade over the camlots or friends.  the extendable loop is long enough to be truely useful and the lobes are quite a bit wider without adding weight.  It may be psycological but i reach for them first (unless im reaching for a totem..) i would buy whatever is cheaper between bd and wc.  the wc is a litter nicer but not much.  it is mostly personal preference.  ,Jan 2016,Apr 25 2018,3

3602,Friend vrs camalot,3,1, Really?  For double axle cams~ BD~ WC~ DMM~ Totem Basic~ Trango~ the expansion ranges are just about identical and east to translate from C4 size to the other makes.,Jun 2014,Apr 25 2018,0
3603,Friend vrs camalot,3,2," Try the Wild Country cams you may like them.  The lobes are wider than BD~ nice for soft rock like sandstone.  The hollow axles not only save weight but create a larger contact area for the cam lobe to rotate on.  This means over time the lobes shouldn't wear as quickly on the axle producing sideways ""slop"".   I've used BD Camalots for 20 years but now purchase WC when wanting a new cam (plus a few BD ultralights!)",Mar 2010,Oct 5 2018,1

3607,Friend vrs camalot,3,6, To try and get back to your question~ I just bought a full set of new friends and I absolutely love them. I've been climbing the same double rack of BD for six-ish years~ and my new go-to for long routes is a double rack consisting of one set BD~ one set WC. I'm not sure if my BD's are just showing their age~ but the WC's seem ever so slightly larger and the two just compliment each other well. I personally really like the extendable sling and the light weight of the WC's. Good action and holding power. Familiar colors. It seems like they've been on offer quite a bit around the internet stores too. If you happen to be around Smith next week you're welcome to try them out.,Nov 2014,Oct 6 2018,0
3608,Friend vrs camalot,3,7, The cam of the future is available now. Why not choose the Totem cams. ,Sep 2016,Oct 6 2018,5
3609,Friend vrs camalot,3,8, This sounds like a car ad... and no surprise because you sell Totems and have an obvious agenda to be partial to them. Hardly appropriate for a gear review thread about camalots and friends. And with no information to support such claim~ it's quite a worthless contribution. I don't have a problem with pedaling your Totem business on the For Sale forum~ but keep your advertising out of the rest of the forum -- simply poor class. Back on topic~ it is a critical distinction whether we are talking about old Friends (single axle) or new Friends (dual axle). Tech specs between new Friends and C4s have been outlined correctly up thread (between all the chest beating). I agree with the general consensus that new Friends are almost the same as C4s with a few minor improvements. If I were buying new and prices the same~ I would choose new Friends. However I don't often buy cams new and thus most of my creek rack are C4s -- cheap and easy to find.  The difference between old Friends and C4s is significant~ and furthermore the differences between classic rigid stem Friends~ Tech Friends~ and Helium Friends (other than camming range/angle) is also significant. Generally speaking the older the version~ the stiffer the springs and more rigid the stem. The Helium Friends (latest version) are basically the C4 stem and trigger design~ but with a single axle and a bit lighter. Some people really like them~ but I never carry them part of my standard double rack because the lobes sometimes do wonky rotating. The only place I've found the range difference to be of critical use is at Indian Creek. I have a rack of Helium Friends and a rack of Metolius Fat cams to fill sizes between C4s/Dragons/New Friends. It's not consistent or precise throughout the entire range~ but for example with a C4 #2~ a #3 old Friend will fit great when the C4 is tipped out and a #8 metolius fits when the old Friend is tipped out but still fits just smaller than a C4 #3.,Dec 2016,Oct 6 2018,8
3610,Friend vrs camalot,3,9, Not reading all of that^^^ The single axle helium friends sucked ass. The new ones are nice~ but I find the extendable slings really don't provide much benefit. My ultimate rack~ Single C4's with UL #3's & #4. Single totems blue-red. At first I wasn't a believer in totems~ but if you can get a deal on them~ don't hesitate.,Jul 2014,Oct 6 2018,2

3613,Friend vrs camalot,3,12, One thing to note is that the Friends have no anodization on the contact area of the lobes. I have only climbed with the Friends a few times~ but the DMM Dragons also have the anodization removed in the same spot~ and I often climb with a blue dragon and a blue camalot on my harness~ so I can compare the two. The lack of anodization and texture seems to make a significant difference in preventing the Dragon cams from walking. Specifically~ these large-ish cams seem to like to rotate~ and the Dragon Cam rotates less in my experience. The extendable slings are nice but don't really remove the need for slings to extend~ and I don't care about the thumb loops. So to me~ the lack of anodization is the biggest difference between the Dragon Cams and the Camalots. As I said before~ I haven't climbed as much with the Friends (only when climbing partners have them) but they also seem to rotate a bit less due to the removed anodization. The anodization does come off of the Camalots over time~ but if you can get cams that work optimally right out of the box~ I'm not sure why you'd settle for less. I've had my camalots longer than I've had my dragons~ almost 2 years~ and the C4 still has some anodization left~ and still walks more than the dragons.,Jan 2017,Oct 8 2018,2
3614,Friend vrs camalot,3,13, I did notice while aid climbing that the stem on the WC New friends can twise out of alignment with the heads. It was more annoying than concerning~ but I still ordered another full set of them when I hit the ground cause I get a good deal on them and they compliment my rack of C4s well,Mar 2016,Oct 8 2018,0
3615,Friend vrs camalot,3,14, Marc~ your grammar is excused; I would surely sound much worse if I tried to reply in French-Canadian. The foundation of my complaint is that you provided a response without any supporting reasons~ same complaint I have with Max's comment and many other's. Granted~ I could have expressed this in a nicer tone with less accusations~ so my apologies on that. However~ it leaves readers to make assumptions on your reasoning for making the claim. If you were assuming most readers are aware of your review on that page 4 (as I was)~ then it would be safe to assume most readers also know you sell Totems~ and mentioning such or including a link would not be necessary for your comment to be interrupted as an advertisement~ if partially subliminal. I've seen countless ads that do not contain a place to purchase or even the product name. I personally think if you're actively engaged in the sale of products~ you should not give reviews on such products without at minimum an honest disclaimer. I will admit I was not aware you also sold DMM or WC~ but you are known around mp as the guy who sells Totems. I do thank you for including in your response why you think Totems are the cam of the future. I was also unaware of any philanthropy your business is engaged in~ and while I and the community greatly appreciate any contributions you make~ it does not omit you from the possibility of being called out on mp. Responding is a personal choice -- welcome to the blackhole! ps - this is not personal. I'm sure you're a great guy~ but to me~ on this forum~ you're more of a retailer than a fellow user. My perception could be wrong~ but I read the latest threads weekly and I'm not sure I've seen a post (or very many) from you not related to praising or selling Totems. At a certain point (ie this thread) I think it to be poor business class~ but not to be confused with ethics. Honestly~ I encourage you to not engage in any of the forum and instead spend that time with your family or climbing~ as we all should. If you would like to discuss anything further~ please feel free to pm me so as not to dilute this thread any further. My apologies to the greater mp for two posts of irrelevant nonsense.,Dec 2016,Oct 8 2018,4
3616,Friend vrs camalot,3,15, I don't know how much effect anodizing really has on walking.  In looking at metal on metal wear~ it appears that anodizing can reduce initial friction but also decreases wear~ so it looks like anodizing offers advantages in one area and disadvantages in the other.  But overall~ I expect it to more of a marketing issue.  The texturing on the Dragons are far more likely to reduce walking than the effect on anodizing.,Jun 2014,Oct 9 2018,0

3620,Friend vrs camalot,3,19, Is there a clear performance winner of Dmm dragon vs Camelot c4 vs wild country or just personal preference? Personal preference~ and in my personal opinion~ it's really nice to mix up brands when doubling up your rack~ the colors correspond~ but the sizes are slightly off~ if you know that one set of cams is always slightly smaller than another~ you've got a little more options in your placements.,Mar 2015,Dec 26 2018,1
3621,Friend vrs camalot,4,0, It's not JUST personal preference. Some things~ like thumb loops~ are personal preference~ but there's a pretty clear difference in how much Dragons walk/rotate versus how much the C4s walk/rotate in the larger sizes (the C4s walk/rotate more). There are also price differences~ which are fairly objective. If you're just buying on price~ it's hard to beat buying used C4s off MP~ and they're perfectly adequate for most things. But there are real advantages to the other cams.,Jan 2017,Dec 26 2018,3

I advised him not to do that and offered to let him use my rope. He declined.   A month later I saw him with a real climbing rope. BUT~ he was using the Home Depot rope to build a TR anchor. Again~ he declined my sage advice.   Ran into him a third time and he told me he got his ""certification"" and was going to take out his son's Boy Scout troop. After some questions~ I realized that ""certification"" meant he passed the belay test at the gym.",Mar 2012,Mar 9 2014,0

Fairly good info here as well: ​https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/camping-and-hiking/best-ultralight-sleeping-bag/ratings The highest rated is 19.1 lbs and made in USA.

3688,Thermarest Vesper first impressions,1,6, Shit Bill~ 19 lbs to be comfortable on a summer night?!? Seems a little heavy. I think carrying in a cord of wood would be lighter~ since you wouldn't have to pack it out~ and no geese would need to be pucked.   ,Apr 2014,Jan 23 2019,6
3689,Thermarest Vesper first impressions,1,7, Your liner (14 oz) and quilt (19oz) together weigh 33 oz. That's the same weight as a lot of 10 degree bags. Is this going to be that much warmer?,Nov 2014,Jan 23 2019,2
3690,Thermarest Vesper first impressions,1,8, The idea is to use only the quilt for most things down to just below freezing~ being as light as possible.  Then if it gets closer to zero~ I can add the liner and puffy (as shown). It mostly comes down to the cost of owning two bags. This setup will allow me to be ultralight in the higher temps~ while still being moderately lightweight down to 0°.,Mar 2016,Jan 23 2019,1

3696,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,0, Basically the only ski boot I've ever enjoyed ice climbing in!,Nov 2012,Nov 1 2018,2
3697,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,1," Thanks for the review! Regarding size~ if your foot is size 9 which is 25cm~ shouldn't you have chosen a Procline Boot with Mondo Size 25? I hear the Procline Boots do fit small~ low volume and narrow~ and most reviews I've seen sized up by 0.5 from their typical downhill Ski Boot Mondo Size~ but you sized all the way up to Mondo Size 27.5! Did you size up so you could wear warmer and thicker socks and so your toes don't get hurt when ice climbing? If so~ based on your review~ that larger size didn't seem to impact your downhill skiing performance. Also~ do you do what this reviewer did when ice climbing with these boots? ""I also found that locking in the ski mode allowed me to lean into my boot and relax those calf muscles. Amazing! ""http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web17w/ms-arcteryx-procline-boots Thanks.",Mar 2017,Nov 3 2018,0
3698,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,2, You're welcome! Size chart lists a US Men's 9 = Mondo 27. I went up .5 in Mondo size for perfect fit. As mentioned in review I wear my Darn Tough ski socks~ linked in review.,Nov 2012,Nov 4 2018,0
3699,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,3, Wouldn't the nature of the boot's shape in ski mode force you to drop your heel? Itd be impossible to point your toes down if anything right? ,Sep 2017,Nov 8 2018,2
3700,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,4, Wouldn't the nature of the boot's shape in ski mode force you to drop your heel? Itd be impossible to point your toes down if anything right?  Force? I guess~ but in walk mode you can drop your heel even further. The more I think about it I'm 100% sure climbing in ski mode would suck compared to tour mode. No thanks.,Nov 2012,Nov 8 2018,0
3701,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,5, True true. More articulation but less lock. I have the non carbon version of the boot and absolutely love them for ice. Glad to see a review that backs up my observations. Woulda went with carbon if I didn't find these new for 250$. I wish the buckle didn't go over the top of my foot. I woulda taken a small weight penalty for 2 buckles over the foot. ,Sep 2017,Nov 8 2018,2
3702,Arcteryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boots Review,1,6, Are these boots flexible enough in walk mode to use while driving (an automatic car) to and from the base of the approach or ski resort? Thx,Mar 2017,Jan 18 2019,0

3706,Wild country Ropeman,1,0, Can someone who’s used this device give me a review on it?  What are your thoughts from the Ropeman 1 vs 2?,Oct 2017,Jan 16 2019,1
3707,Wild country Ropeman,1,1, I bought a Ropeman 2 several years ago as an economical ascender~ but have never used it.  I think if you are hauling up a bag it might come in handy.  What are you planning to use it for?,Apr 2016,Jan 16 2019,3
3708,Wild country Ropeman,1,2, I used the new ropeman 2 as my secondary for tr soloing the last two weekends and it was good~ but needs more line tension to glide smoothly compared to the MicroTrax,Mar 2016,Jan 16 2019,1
3709,Wild country Ropeman,1,3, Both are great devices in my opinion~ but I think I prefer V1 because it doesn't have the ascender like teeth. I always feel safer simul climbing knowing you probably won't strip the sheath with the wedge toothed version. However~ if you are only using it for an ascender I think the V2 is great because it generally slips way less when stuff gets weird. ,Jun 2009,Jan 16 2019,2
3710,Wild country Ropeman,1,4, I’ve used both. They both work fine as backup ascenders~ but you really want a real ascender.  I mostly use them as a secondary tr solo device~ where they shine. You can’t forget to engage the cam~ so if it’s on~ it’s on. You do need line tension~ as John mentioned. I usually use a nalgene~ which works fine.  I think I have a slight preference for the toothed one~ the mark 1? But they feel pretty interchangeable to me ,Nov 2006,Jan 16 2019,2
3711,Wild country Ropeman,1,5, Thank you everyone ,Oct 2017,Jan 16 2019,0
3712,Wild country Ropeman,1,6, I have a V2 that I keep on my harness pretty much all the time~ in lieu of a prussic cord.  I've only had to use it twice for real~ once when bailing off an overhanging route I was TRing and couldn't make it to the next bolt with the directional~ and once when I got my shirt caught in my rappel device.  I've also practiced rope-soloing in a simul-climb like set-up.  It worked well in all cases.  Light and compact and easy to use and the teeth don't bother me since I don't see myself using it in an application that risks destroying a sheath.  I've picked up a Micro-trax for those times.,Dec 2016,Jan 16 2019,1
3713,Wild country Ropeman,1,7, The ropeman2 is rated for a wider range of rope diameter (8-11mm??).  I want to say the ropeman1 is rated for ropes 10mm and larger~ but I don't have it right in front of me.  That being said~ I use both to TR solo and have not had any issues with the ropeman1 on my 9.6mm rope.  As mentioned above~ you need a lot of rope tension for both v1 & v2 to feed smoothly.,Jun 2004,Jan 16 2019,2
3714,Wild country Ropeman,1,8, I've got a ropeman 2 for a pocket 3 to 1 when combined with a grigri and pulley~ it does the job and doesnt take up much space~ would buy again.,Mar 2015,Jan 16 2019,1
3715,Wild country Ropeman,1,9, they do their jobs well! Better options out there though (roll n' lock) that won't give you as much rope drag if you are using them for simul climbing,Aug 2017,Jan 19 2019,1
3716,Wild country Ropeman,1,10, Agreed~ rollnlock is far and away the best simul climbing device.,Oct 2017,Jan 19 2019,1
3717,Wild country Ropeman,1,11, I’ve been happy with mine for TR solo~ rigging 3 to 1 hauls and protecting simul climbs. That said~ I don’t have much to compare them to. I’ve practiced using them as emergency ascenders~ but that was not so great. ,Nov 2017,Jan 19 2019,0
3718,Wild country Ropeman,1,12, Oh shit~ Nick~ I didn't realize you'd posted this. Let me know if you want to borrow mine. ,Mar 2015,Jan 20 2019,2
3719,Wild country Ropeman,1,13, Sweet~ I’ll contact you or see you at earth treks,Oct 2017,Jan 21 2019,0
3720,Wild country Ropeman,1,14," I've used Ropeman-2 for years for top-rope soloing.  Works great. I'd give it "" 4 1/2 stars"".   I also ALWAYS carry one on my harness...figure in an emergency it's a lot better than a prussic and it weighs next to nothing. I carry 2 (or sometimes 3) on glaciers.   I picked the ""2"" because when I was buying them the ""1"" was plastic. I've not used it for ""running"" belays while symul-climbing.  Only negative comment is that with some thicker biners it is more of a pain to work with~ so I have dedicated biners that I use with mine.",Aug 2013,Jan 21 2019,2
3721,Wild country Ropeman,1,15, That’s really helpful~ thanks Robert,Oct 2017,Jan 21 2019,0
3722,Wild country Ropeman,1,16, Forgot to mention~ I usually move the ascender up manually ahead of me on the rope as I climb up.   I use an 8mm sling~ girth hitched to my harness. I always carry a second one~ and independently put it on the rope (with 2nd sling) at overhangs~ etc.~ where if I fell the ascended might slam into/over an edge. I'm usually climbing less-than-90-fegree slab.  As with all such set ups~ you need to weight the rope ( I used an old~ 1/2 liter water btl filled with water) or~ for the first 30 ft or so you'll just pull up rope when you try to move it up.  Folk who use the Petzl small ascender have a slightly easier time of it.,Aug 2013,Jan 21 2019,1
3723,Tenaya Mundaka,1,0, Picked up a pair of these yesterday~ sized 2 full sizes under street shoes. Tight but zero discomfort. Very sticky and confidence inspiring. The design of the shoe does not have an extremely downturned toe~ so no toe knuckle pain. I let my wife try them who is 1 foot size smaller~ she absolutely loved them~ we are buying her a pair today. I would not hesitate to recommend this shoe to any climber intermediate and up. I've heard they lack durability~ I'll update this if they fall apart.,Jul 2017,Jan 21 2019,0
3724,Tenaya Mundaka,1,1, I climb with two people who use them and love them for inside climbing.  I can also attest to the short term life on the rubber~ especially if you boulder in them.,Oct 2017,Jan 21 2019,0
3725,Tenaya Mundaka,1,2, They don't necessarily fall apart~ the soft rubber just blows out quickly. After a resole in another rubber~ they'll last as long as you would expect. ,Mar 2015,Jan 21 2019,0
3726,Evolv Oracle,1,0, I picked up the new shoe from Evolv a couple weeks ago and really like it.  I used to wear the Shaman~ three iterations ago~ then they changed the toe rubber and the toe box and I switched to the MR Shark 2.0 for a few years.  I'm still climbing the Sharks~ but after a couple weeks I am liking the Oracle much better.  I have only climbed them in the gym so far~ and my impression is that they are a bit softer in the arch than the old Shamans but a little stiffer than the Sharks.  I am able to flex my foot enough to use the shoe on vertical to slightly slabby terrain without feeling like I'm walking in ballet point~ and they feel super secure on overhanging terrain and roofs.   I size the Oracle one full size up from my street shoe and they are snug~ but not painful.  The full lace is really nice and the lace system they use makes them hold the cinch really well~ so even if I just pull them tight but don't tie them all the way for warm-up periods they still feel secure.   My foot shape is broad toe~ average heel~ high arch.  Other shoes I've tried but not liked are the Solutions (heel did not feel secure) and the Butora Acro (destroyed my ring toe and big toe~ even in the wide version).   Another bonus~ they make my feet sweat about half as much as the Shark.  My Sharks go funky quick~ but the Oracle hardly seems worn even after a half dozen sessions in them.  The Oracle makes me really curious about the General as an alternative to the TC Pro...  ,Dec 2016,Apr 6 2018,5
3727,Evolv Oracle,1,1, good review! they're on my list of possible new shoes.,Dec 2017,Apr 6 2018,0
3728,Evolv Oracle,1,2, Thanks for the review. I use Shamans for overhanging sport stuff and love my Luchador laces for more moderate terrain. Seems like the Oracle might fall in between. ,Jan 2016,Apr 7 2018,0
3729,Evolv Oracle,1,3, For size reference I bought these in 10s same as street shoe. Too small for me. I'll probably bump up to 10.5. I'm a 42 in most sportivas.  To tight for my toes but the rest of the shoe felt great. I can see someone that likes really tight shoes and dealing with break in buying street shoe size.,Mar 2015,May 1 2018,0
3730,Evolv Oracle,1,4, ^^^+1^^^ regarding Paul L's recommendation to size up one size from street shoes for a snug painless fit.,Jan 2007,Nov 12 2018,0
3731,Evolv Oracle,1,5, Great shoe. They do great on steeps but also manage to edge well. I typically prefer stiffer shoes but these have surprised me with how well they perform. The heel also fits nicely~ which I have had trouble with in the past. My feet are pretty narrow and the heels of most shoes feel too boxy for me. I got them in my street shoe size and they feel quite aggressive~ which I like. ,Nov 2011,Jan 11 2019,0

3734,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,2, I found them to be narrow and difficult to get my foot through the gaiter.,Jan 2003,Dec 19 2018,0
3735,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,3, I wear a US 10 in the boot and wear a 44 in the batura. Great boot for long approaches with technical ice involved for those with a narrow foot.  The rubber on the acrux is crap though. Really slick on rock and hard. ,unknown,Dec 19 2018,0
3736,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,4, @harold sutton I wear a 12.5 in brooks and hoka and wear a 12.5 in the Acrux or a 46 in the G5. I also have room to put in superfeet. I'm not really sure how people can't manage the gaiter~ maybe i got lucky but you toss the inner on~ roll the gaiter down~ pull the tongue out for space and it slides in. Reasonable boots for mountaineering but nothing special. i like the g5 more for ice however. ,Feb 2018,Dec 20 2018,1
3737,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,5, I'm a medium US Size 9 street shoe and the 42 fits me perfectly. Ditto other comments about the gaiter~ just put the liner on first~ roll the gaiter down~ and slip on in. Easy peezy. I love these boots~ but I am hoping to try the G5 soon!,Nov 2012,Dec 22 2018,0
3738,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,6, Arc's sizing can be a little frustrating.https://arcteryx.com/sizing-chart.aspx?country=us&language=en&article=sizing-chart-fit-guide-popup-footwear  In Acrux I wore 12.5 US which they translate as 47 and 1/3 Euro. In LS Batura I wore 13 US which they translated at 47. Most of my street shoes are 13. Richard wears the same size Acrux but one size smaller LS. Dave is a 9~ wears a 42 which Arc says is 8.5 US. As you can see it's a crapshoot :-) If you're buying online best to order 3 sizes to compare. I personally found the boots too narrow and the lateral footbox short (vertically) so my little toes couldn't wiggle enough. YMMV. You can see the lateral side of the boot is pretty angular when viewed from the front. Maybe your feet will love it though. ​https://i0.wp.com/www.thealpinestart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Arcteryx_Acrux_AR_Boot_Review-8.jpg?ssl=1​​​,Sep 2013,Dec 22 2018,0
3739,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,7, good point~ my foot measures 28.5cm long and 10.5cm wide at its widest. Hope that helps.,Feb 2018,Dec 22 2018,0
3740,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,8, Thanks so much for all replies folks.  I really love the climbing community.   Its one of the few you can post a question~ and get thoughtful detailed answers.  Either way it looks like i am just going to need to find a store that has my size range in stock~ and then try a bunch on. When i called around on Friday the only store that had enough on hand was OGE up in Vermont.   Right now i am a toss up between the Acrux AR~ the LaSportiva G5 and the SCAPA Phantom Tech.  From what i have been reading the Phantom is actually colder than the rest.  And the one thing i really do not like about the G5 is that they are not waterproof.. I have a friend that dunked his foot while on a approach~ and got the inside of the boot totally wet.  They seem like an awesome boot but i would get nervous doing anything more than Front country cragging in them.  And that's a steep price for a boot that i don't feel comfortable taking in to the back country.  ,Jun 2018,Dec 24 2018,0
3741,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,9, I've had the Acrux and the Phantom Tech~ I don't think the Scarpas are colder on my feet but again fit is important.  My Acrux 12.5s are on consignment at OGE if that happens to be your size.  G5...meh. No boas for me. I didn't bother to try them on. ,Sep 2013,Dec 24 2018,1
3742,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,10, If you're not going to be standing on your front points for long periods or spending tons of time on ice i'd stay away from the G5. The scarpa and the Acrux have fewer failure points and are waterproofed. Theboa  anchor near the toe came apart on my first G5s~ but they warrantied. They are stiffer and the Boa is great when it works. Take that for what it is,Feb 2018,Dec 24 2018,0
3743,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,11, The acrux has a much narrower fit than either the g5 or phantom. Keep that in mind with your decision.,Nov 2017,Dec 24 2018,0
3744,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,12, how is the warmth on the Acrux? ,Apr 2011,Dec 24 2018,0
3745,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,13, Yeah~ another poster had issues too. ,Sep 2013,Dec 24 2018,0
3746,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,14, how is the warmth on the Acrux?  For me suboptimal due to the fit - too narrow overall and not enough wiggle room in the toe box. I could only use a very thin sock which didn't help~ thicker socks aggravated the issue. I don't think another size would have helped~ the length of the boot was fine. They're just not for everyone. If they fit you well I imagine they'd offer comparable warmth to the G5 or Phantom Tech~ but certainly not the warmth of the Phantom 6000 or G2. ,Sep 2013,Dec 24 2018,1
3747,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,15," Agreed on all above.The outer shell does seem to soften a bit~ affording moderate accomodation to varying foot sizes but shes narrow.

3748,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Long Term Review,1,16, I will echo the sizing point for future readers: I really wanted to buy the Acrux~ and I tried on a pair.  They were simply too narrow for my foot.  If you are a traditional Scarpa fit rather than Sportiva fit~ you probably can't wear these boots.  It was absurd how narrow they were (for my foot).  It was a bummer because I think they are a great idea.  I won't be surprised if Arc'teryx  has created a new market niche with these boots~ but I'll have to wait for other manufacturers to make something similar.  FWIW~ I ended up getting the Phantom Techs~ and I couldn't be happier.  ,Jun 2018,Jan 6 2019,1

3751,Petzl Quark New 2018 Review,1,0, Every new winter season~ I try to upgrade some of my old mountaineering gear and change my old gear to new models. Mountaineering gear can be rather expensive and therefore I do such upgrades gradually. Like always~ prior of purchasing a new item~ I do an extensive market research. For the new ice axe~ I had specific needs and wishes. I wanted the new ice axe to be a multipurpose ice axe that I could use it for general mountaineering~ but also on more technical terrains~ such as on couloirs and more mix climbing activities.Read full review here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2018/12/31/petzl-quark-new-2018-review/ The ice axes I was looking for where the following ones:,Oct 2017,Jan 5 2019,1

3757,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,2, Prices I've seen for most Rock Empire cams (other designs~ models) have always been very very reasonable. Direct from the manufacturer~ as most places and internet sources often don't carry them. Nice review.,Nov 2007,Nov 13 2011,0
3758,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,3, Is there a particular reason you're flogging this horse~ Killis?  (saw you bashing RE undeservedly in snother thread the other day...)  From the sound of it you have a very strong opinion regarding RE and are letting it run your mouth in spite of never actually having used the cams in the review.  Quite simply~ RE has seemingly set price pionts for their *multiple* cam lines and you're bashing on thierry flagship model based on experience with their value line.  Furthermore~ if a slight improvident in ergononomics of your gear is all it takes for you climb harder it's clearly nor the gear that's the problem.  Plenty of people in Eastern Europe (and *gasp!!!*) Pakistan pull down plenty hard with gear like this~ so step back a moment and actually think about things before you spout off repeatedly.  Hell~ 20/30 years ago folks were getting by just fine without cams altogether~ so why the absolute need for smooth actions and refined ergonomics?  More dollars than sense~ near as I can figure.   Full disclosure: I have quite a few RE cams~ which get used just as much as most all of my other cams.  Sure~ some work smoother than others but often one will fit better than the rest and it'll get placed regardless of how smooth the trigger pull is. To the OP: BEST review I've seen in a long time~ and jealous of your testing machine.  :-),Sep 2008,Nov 15 2011,0
3759,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,4, Thanks Datesman for the feedback.  Many people do give Rock Empire a bad reputation.  I hate to make assumptions but many of these people have the extra money to afford the high end cams (Black Diamond~ DMM~ Wild Country~ Metolius~ etc.)~ and Rock Empire equipment just might not be what they're looking for~ which is understandable.  If you are a college student~ or just a climber with little money~ these are a wonderful alternative to the bank breaking alternatives.  I see the argument that the smaller sizes do not have equivalent strength ratings to the Camalot~ but for someone looking to save money~ we realize in retrospect~ how many times are we actually going to need more than 9kN to save us on that whipper?  All I can say is~ that is one hell of a factor 2 fall one has to take in order to snap a 9kN rated piece of gear.   Also~ some of these skeptics may have used the old versions of RE gear (circa 2007).  Some of the old RE cams felt like they were going to rattle apart in your hand.  A friend of mine who knew I was a Rock Empire enthusiast showed me a set of RE cams that he purchased around 2006~ and I had to laugh.  They flopped around so much when you shook the flex stem back and forth~ the lobes did a 360.  I can attest to the fact that they have improved a lot since they first came on the market and feel as secure~ well built~ and well engineered as the top models of today.,Jun 2009,Nov 16 2011,0

3762,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,7, You were doing fine until you started in with all the hyperbole:- For the price you cannot beat a cam like the Axel Cam from Rock Empire.     - You get the feel and camming range of the BD Camalot~ at a fraction of the price.     - ...these are a wonderful alternative to the bank breaking alternatives.   It was a nice effort but your logic is flawed if you think sacrificing 30% of your strength rating to save $5 is worthwhile.  Besides~ I've paid less than the RE cams sale prices you listed for every BD cam I own.,May 2007,Nov 16 2011,0

3765,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,10," I've used Rock Empire cams before~ the single stem ones that look exactly like the Trango Flex Cams. Action was decent and they held fine. Walked a bit and had to do some nut tool surgery a few times but other than that~ they were decent cheap cams.   My problem with Rock Empire comes in here: rockempire.com/about   Neat and Cool doesn't have a store in Squamish. They don't have a little gear shop. They operate out of a P.O. Box in Garibaldi Highlands. You can't just ""go by and say hello"".

3766,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,11," My thoughts from the previous review thread mountainproject.com/v/gear4… still apply:   ""Another vote for overpriced for what you get. That was supposed to be their one ""advantage"".    Labor Day sale saw a set of BD c4s .5-3 for $229 on backcountry. $46/ea for something that looks quite a bit more refined/finished.    The unfinished look on these is a tough sell at $30 each; $55 HA! Oh and this comes from a cheap ass bastard.""   Although~ these appear to be more finished - I still say their one advantage is price and is easily beaten with BD c4s bought on sale.",Oct 2010,Nov 16 2011,0
3767,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,1,12, You're certainly entitled to your opinion~ so if you don't mind spending the extra money more power to you.  Way I look at Mgear has BD .5 - 3 for $325 list / $287 sale (backorder only).  Adding the 4 for $85 brings it to $410 / $372.  The RE set is $365 list / $348 sale.  The $50 difference list will get you another cam.  Sale price a bit over halfway to another cam.  And bear in mind the dollar hasn't  been doing well against the Euro~ so if the economy ever picks back up and the dollar strengthens RE cams will likely be an even better deal (especially if the EU is still mired in their current mess).,Sep 2008,Nov 16 2011,0

3780,Rock Empire Axel Cam Review,2,4, I've used these cams for some years and I must stay they work fine compared to BD C4s. There's downside that I've noticed. One is that they tend to be a bit harder to retrive (more fiddling). I belive this is because the design of the very end of the lubes. Two the smaller sizes are wider then C4. And yes they are a bit heavier but as you need to carrie less qds (thanks to the extendable sling) this evens out. I've taken some falls on them and they do the job just fine :),Jan 2019,Jan 4 2019,0
3781,Singing Rock Bandit ice tools?,1,0, Does anyone have any experience with the “Singing rock bandit” ice tools.

3782,Singing Rock Bandit ice tools?,1,1, See this already?https://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/gear/review_-_singing_rock_bandit_ice_axe-609720 Seem like a perfectly reasonable first set of tools if you're on a budget. Trango Raptors are also well liked if you want an ergo handle.  Accessories might be tough to find in a pinch. Pretty sure I could find a Petzl pick in any mountain town or popular base camp~ at worst I can count on getting one from multiple well known online retailers with free 2 day shipping.  The other plus with Petzl is they've been doing this for a while so they're not going anywhere~ they also just redesigned their tools so I think you can count on the current picks being sold for years.  All that is pretty trivial if a set of Petzls takes food off your table. I doubt the Singing Rock or Trango is gonna cost you a send. Get some and go climb. Any tools >>> no tools. ,Sep 2013,Dec 30 2018,0

3784,Singing Rock Bandit ice tools?,1,3, Quarks are good tools. If you end up climbing a lot of ice with them~ you should try the pick weights (Petzl calls them Masselottes). Quarks sadly don't come equipped with them like Petzl's other tools. ,Sep 2013,Jan 1 2019,0
3785,Resole question,1,0, I have been resoling my climbing shoes for a while and have figured out most of the process~ however I'm having trouble with the joint between the new sole and the old. Just the line under the ball of the foot. It seems to separate after some time. I have tried 45 degree and a straight line~ no angle. Then I push hard acRoss the joint with a screw driver. Finish in a press. Any help is appreciated. ,Mar 2013,Dec 30 2018,0
3786,Resole question,1,1," When you flex the shoe~ that part of the sole is under tension~ which tends to pull that seam open. Butting the old and new rubber together i.e. ""no angle""~ isn't going to work. Go with a gradual~ thin taper so there's as much contact area as possible. And I think (non-pro opinion) it helps to flex the shoe when you press the new sole on. When you release the flexing~ that area should be under a tiny bit of compression~ going back to ""normal"" as the shoe is flexed again in use. Otherwise it's trying to get pulled apart every time the sole is bent.",Jul 2009,Dec 30 2018,1
3787,Resole question,1,2," Where the new rubber meets the old mid sole~ ANGLE the cut~ and instead of using a press or a screwdriver~ lay it against a solid surface and hammer it pretty hard~ but not too hard. Could also be the glue you're using (Could also be the original prep/grind) Try Masters and it's dedicated thinner or Barge and it's thinner. (Follow instructions to the T) ""It seems to separate after some time"" The dreaded delam. It can happen for many reasons~ from bad glue technique~ bad surface prep~ improper care~ others.

3793,Theoretical Data for Comparing Lightweight Down Hooded Jackets,1,0, Scientist in me getting into the data with down hoddies available.  I realize Fill Power * Fill weight is not a perfect metric for absolute warmth but had to do something.  In the perfect world~ I would incorporate the jacket material thickness/resistance to wind that might provide a better number.  Anyway~ enjoy this is what I have so far on jackets below 15 oz.

3808,Mammut Magic Guide High GTX????,1,3, I have a pair of Mammut magic advanced high gtx boots which i use for mountaineering and ice in the north cascades & sw BC. I have used them for a few years now and am happy with them so far. They are pretty true to size imo (I sized up a half size to avoid smashing my toes). I have fairly wide toes and found they work well for me. One thing to note is they did not come with removable insoles but i added my own from my old backpacking boots. I have found them to be fairly waterproof and warm on water ice and peaks over 3000m when paired with gaiters. I use them with grivel cramp-o-matic crampons and they are solid. Also can confirm that BD & Petzl crampons fit as well but i havnt used them as often in technical terrain. That being said i dont know what all the differences between the magic advanced and the magic guides are.,Jun 2017,Jun 24 2018,1
3809,Mammut Magic Guide High GTX????,1,4, I did get a pair. I would say they fit true to size and are fairly low volume~ especially in toe box which is the only reason I'm not going to keep em. The heel lacing system is pretty cool and I can tell a difference (walking around in basement) in improved heel lock. ,Nov 2017,Jun 26 2018,1
3810,Mammut Magic Guide High GTX????,1,5, For those who have used these boots. Would they perform well on both alpine rock and ice cragging? I'm looking at either the Magic High or Magic Guide High. I'm not near any retailers that carry them and I'm hoping to buy a pair online. Which brings me to the next point. Anyone know of any other boot (Scarpa or LaSportiva) that has a similar boot to make sure I can fit them well? I don't like buying online for this reason but don't have a choice on this one. tia,Nov 2018,Nov 12 2018,0
3811,Mammut Magic Guide High GTX????,1,6, I think any fully rigid boot will work well for ice cragging as long as your feet stay warm (ish). For alpine rock? I use rock shoes.... fully rigid boots are pretty bad at 4/5th class rock since they cant smear. Not saying people haven’t climbed hard rock in Spantiks in Alaska but personally I take rock shoes (or approach shoes) if the climbing will be harder than 5.3 or so.,Jun 2017,Dec 21 2018,0
3812,Patagonia Ascensionist: New vs Old Model,1,0, Alright.  I was skeptical.  I had and loved my old model Ascensionist 45L and it went everywhere with me.  When the frame broke~ I was really~ really bummed~ but it's pleasantly surprised me.  I've seen multiple people on here specifically looking for the old model~ so I thought I'd add my thoughts having extensively used both.   The changes as I understand them: durability of material~ downsizing 5L~ changing the ice tool attachments~ changing the frame and frame slot~ making the chest clip adjustable~ slight changes to waist belt~ removing the rain cover~ changes to the main closure mechanisms~ and adding a cheese pocket.  Durability 10/10: good change! The material was prone to snagging under as much abuse as I put it through.  My pack had multiple holes in it~ both in the main part and the bottom.  They have reinforced the bottom with foam on the new ones and the new material seems to be a much higher denier fabric.  It probably costs some weight~ though I think the pack is still lighter than the original.  Downsizing 5L: This I was super skeptical of. I already was hard pressed to fit all my stuff into my old pack.  They’re definitely slim packs.  But let’s put it this way.  I’ve been able to carry probably 50+ pounds of gear in this pack.  My partner and I packed eight days of food~ ice gear~ glacier gear~ and rock gear~ into 2 40L packs (mine the Ascensionist~ his another pack that I think is slightly bigger). Mine personally had: tent fly and poles~ sleeping bag~ inflatable sleeping pad~ half our food~ 4 oz fuel canister~ harness~ all my layers/clothes~ inflatable sleeping pad~ some miscellaneous toiletries~ and a helmet inside the pack AND a rope~ a snow picket~ a MSR fuel bottle~ a pair of steel crampons~ a foam sleeping pad~ and a pair of mountaineering boots on the outside.  So you have to be a bit careful of how you pack and may end up packing more than you want to on the outside~ but space can be finagled.  Ice tool attachments: this is a net neutral for me.  I don’t mind them~ but it’s much harder to remove your tool when the packs on your back.  They probably removed some weight here though.  The key to the pick straps is to secure the pick before you secure the shaft~ otherwise they’re not quite flexible enough.  I do like that the shaft velcro is removable~ but I would just lose them.  But if you don’t need them you can just remove them.  Frame and Frame slot 10/10: great job. The old packs frame was seriously flawed.  This probably not only saves weight~ but it makes for a great bivy sleeping pad (not actually kidding~ it insulates well).  I haven’t removed it yet~ but it definitely won’t have the same problems as the old pack did with the frame slot just ripping.  Chest clip adjustability 10/10: good job.  I point blank couldn’t move mine on my last pack so it was just really awkwardly placed on my chest (ladies you feel me here…). Good job. It’s now actually adjustable.  Waist belt: from what I can tell~ the differences are the little foam things slide on the actual straps and the gear loops are not covered in the little plastic things.  I like both changes.  It’s nice to be able to a) adjust the padding to cover your hip bones exactly and b) be able to move the gear loops to where you want them.  When I’m ice/glacier climbing I’ve been actually racking on the gear loops and it’s been great.  I can adjust them to fit over and around my cliperdoodles (otherwise known as ice clippers) and I can easily get our light ice racks onto them.  I also like the lack of the plastic.  It might hurt durability a bit~ but I can imagine it’ll be less bulky when I don’t need the loops.  Rain cover: one of my only down sides. I really liked the rain cover when I was over-filling the pack.  To be fair~ while cragging I never used it.  But the point of this pack is to be an alpinist’s friend~ and when I was playing alpinist I really liked the rain cover.  I’ve compensated with packing my tarp or rain fly on top to play the same part.  But it’d be nice to just have as it had a little cinch.  Closing mechanisms: Alright this is petty.  The old pack closure was on the pack itself~ the new has the closure on the hood. It’s just taking some getting used to to pull on the right thing. Not actually a problem but irritating and a seemingly useless change. The cord often gets caught on ice axes/other stuff on the pack and can be irritating.  What is an actual problem is the main strap.  I would often lift my packed pack by that strap.  If you pull on the new one~ it doesn’t actually stay cinched~ which I find really irritating.  It should stay closed until you pull on the buckle itself.   Cheese pocket: Ok its not actually a cheese pocket.  But it’s a small~ zippered pocked on the inside of the pack near the top.  It’s a convenience when the packs not super full and incidentally fits a half pound block of cheese really nicely.  It’s a nice little addition.  General Thoughts:  This pack is an incredibly versatile piece of gear.  It expands to fit our shit for eight days of hard climbing and then cinches up pretty small when I’m just putting a set of quick draws and some shoes in it.  I really like the addition of the daisy chains on the front of the pack.  I can loop cord through that and cinch things down on it.  Don’t be discouraged by the hood. I was really skeptical about the hood at first.  Albeit it doesn’t fit as much as a traditional hood will.  But for what I’m assuming is weight savings reasons its nice.  When it’s not full~ it cinches down really nicely and does clip around a rope if you want it to.   Comfort wise this pack’s great.  Pack it well~ and it’ll carry very comfortably.  Again~ I think our packs were 50+ pounds and I had relatively little issues. The only downside is the torso length is long for me and the frame extends a bit too far up from the shoulders to be comfortable all day climbing.  But that is less the pack and more of a me thing I believe.  Overall~ I’m really happy with my new pack.  I never thought it’d live up to the old Ascensionist (I thought I was going to be super disappointed with the new one) but I’ve been pleasantly surprised.  Superb pack for everything from cragging to week long glacier expeditions. ,Mar 2017,Oct 11 2018,7
3813,Patagonia Ascensionist: New vs Old Model,1,1, You could just send the old one to Patagucci for repair and then you’d have both! They fixed a hole that a rat chewed in mine~ took two months~ but worth the wait.,Jun 2016,Oct 11 2018,0
3814,Patagonia Ascensionist: New vs Old Model,1,2, I was in the middle of a seven week road trip and the frame broke so I had to either give it up or deal with the busted pack for the remainder of the trip... was unfortunate. ,Mar 2017,Oct 11 2018,0
3815,Patagonia Ascensionist: New vs Old Model,1,3, Great review. I had the 35L and loved it until the frame broke... traded it for a new 40L. I really do think the new frame is much less comfortable on my back. The daisy sewn into the top is actually really convenient for organizing gear -- a small detail but one of my favorite improvements.,May 2013,Oct 14 2018,1

3818,Omega pacific link cams,1,0, Figuring out whether or not to invest in link cams~ seem like a really solid idea of owning a few and they cover such big ranges.,Jul 2017,Jul 5 2017,0
3819,Omega pacific link cams,1,1, They're cool devices~ and some people love them~ but there are lots of negative comments out there about them. A few based on experience before I sold mine: It's also easy to google stories and pictures of the cams breaking. Placements have to be a little more perfect than they do with other cams or you risk the cam breaking or failing. And although I didn't get any stuck~ I think I've seen more stuck Link Cams than any other type. So they make good permapro. The most-touted benefits are as anchor pieces and as oh-shit pieces when you're getting pumped and don't know exactly what you need~ but they're awfully expensive and heavy to haul along if you mainly use them as anchors. If you already have a set of other cams~ the Links might make sense to supplement your rack while conserving space~ but I certainly wouldn't get them as a primary set unless~ as stated before~ I was doing short routes and pretty much knew what I needed. ,Aug 2014,Jul 5 2017,4
3820,Omega pacific link cams,1,2, I've been using the largest and smallest sizes for nearly a year now. I actually like them mostly for long routes where I want to go light. You may think this makes no sense because they do weigh more per cam but hear me out. I consider it a good middle ground between bringing a single rack and a double rack. Adding the largest and smallest link cams to a normal single rack gives me a second piece approximately in the #2~ #1~ and #0.75 range and another in the #0.5~ #0.4~ and #0.3 range. So it is much lighter than bringing a whole second rack of those sizes in situations when I'm not expecting to need doubles in all of those sizes at once~ which for me tends to be long moderate routes with long approaches. But it is true that they do need to be placed more carefully and so I am very mindful of being a little more choosy about making sure the stem is pointed in the direction of anticipated loading of the cam.,Oct 2016,Jul 5 2017,6

Good post~ Ronald. I actually thought of keeping or re-buying the purple and yellow for the exact reasons you describe~ but I didn't like the action and the walking I found with the yellow and figured it would be easier to sell the whole set. I do kinda miss the purple and red~ though.,Aug 2014,Jul 5 2017,0
3822,Omega pacific link cams,1,4, I used to like them.  Then I broke one and it pulled out in a routine placement in a routine fall with low forces.  I kept the red and the yellow~ thinking they would at least be good in Indian Creek.  But even the Creek has routes that are not pure splitters and I found myself thinking about them whenever I climbed over them. Sold mine after that trip. Good idea~ but they are just too fragile.,Nov 2006,Jul 5 2017,7

If it makes you feel any better~ the 0.5 and 0.75 link cams actually weigh less than their C4 counterparts.,Mar 2014,Jul 5 2017,1
3824,Omega pacific link cams,1,6, Robert Michael wrote: I didn't like the action and the walking I found with the yellow Yeah~ I found that they walk less when they're at least retracted until the first link starts hinging. For placements closer to the wide end of the range they're much more finicky.  If it makes you feel any better~ the 0.5 and 0.75 link cams actually weigh less than their C4 counterparts. Ah~ good to know!,Oct 2016,Jul 6 2017,0
3825,Omega pacific link cams,1,7, As mentioned previously~ They get stuck very easily.  I don't fully understand why they do get stuck~ but I see more fixed link cams than anything else  - even stoppers.  ,Mar 2014,Jul 6 2017,1
3826,Omega pacific link cams,1,8, As mentioned previously~ They get stuck very easily.  I don't fully understand why they do get stuck~ but I see more fixed link cams than anything else  - even stoppers.   I think it is because the cams compress beyond the range of the trigger. So if you shove your link deep~ or if it walks into the overcammed part of its range~ the trigger will not help.,Nov 2006,Jul 6 2017,1
3827,Omega pacific link cams,1,9, I've found the Yellow to be a useful addition to my rack~ but i mainly bought it because it was stupid cheap at brand new for 65 bucks. They are a neat addition to the rack but I wouldn't recommend going out and buying a set at full msrp. If you find them on sale go for it just learn how to place them.,Oct 2015,Jul 6 2017,0
3828,Omega pacific link cams,1,10, I've owned and used them for several years now~ although I haven't had them on my daily rack for a while~ mainly because many partners do not like them.  They get stuck because they have so much more surface area.  If you place them at nearly full retraction and they walk in at all~ they are nearly impossible to retrieve.  So~ don't do that.  I've never gotten one stuck FWIW.  They are also more fragile than C4s~ especially if you use them in horizontal cracks or for aiding.  For me~ they really shine when I am only bringing a single rack on an alpine climb or most especially when plugging gear on a layback~ where you can't see the crack size from the plugging stance.  I see them as a great add on piece to an already complete rack.,Jun 2010,Jul 6 2017,1
3829,Omega pacific link cams,1,11, I got a purple one for free from a friend.  They seem like great pieces to supplement a single rack on moderate alpine climbs when you think that doubles might be nice to have~ especially for anchors.  That said~ every time I am packing for a trip and pick up my purple link cam~ I see how tiny the individual parts of the lobes are and it frankly freaks me out.  Am I just being paranoid?,Jun 2013,Jul 6 2017,0
3830,Omega pacific link cams,1,12, I used to use link-cams on alpine routes as well~ but the newer C4 Ultralights have made them less useful (to me). That's because the combined weight of two C4 ULs is lower~ for the equivalent link-cam range~ than the weight of the one Link-Cam. Twice the pro is better in many ways (volume aside)~ for twice the distance for simulclimbing. This didn't use to be the case until the ULs~ but now I find myself taking two C4 ULs instead of one equivalent link-cam.,Jan 2017,Jul 6 2017,0
3831,Omega pacific link cams,1,13, If you are interested~ I've got an extra gold one that is lightly used I'd be willing to part with for a reasonable price.  PM me.  I got a good deal several years ago but eventually realized I only ever wanted one. I used the whole set for a while but settled into using just the gold. For what it's worth I've taken a good whipper on my gold one and it didn't explode (not the one I'm talking selling~ that one has never been fallen on)  It was my first piece and I unexpectedly slipped off a boulder problem start right over it. I also managed to get a red one stuck on a route when I was panicked and slammed it in too deep. It's still lodged firmly in place 6 years later~ even after everyone has taken turns hammering on it so maybe they aren't *quite* as fragile as folks seem to think?   Through that incident and a few near losses~ I've found the fastest way to get one stuck is to try to use it at the smallest size. I think this is because of several factors. When you retract it down the extra lobe pieces are dangling off the back and have a tendency to get hung up on stuff~ making them more prone to walking by jamming those pieces against odd rock bits and nudging the cam along and those same dangling bits are prone to getting hung up when retracting. They are pointy and when you pull the trigger they all move and irregular rock can grab them. It is also MUCH harder to evaluate the quality of your placement for the smallest size because those arms are often blocking your view. They don't get stuck if you just get the active lobes in the placement but usually folks are stuffing something deep in a flared out crack way back out of sight and get all the lobes in out of reach~ somewhere a nut tool may not be able to reach either.  Also~ maybe this is obvious but~ I run into folks every now and then who maybe haven't used these and seem to think that when you are using the smallest part of the cam that the dangling pieces are somehow engaged. It's just like a normal cam and only the smallest set of available lobes work at a time.  One placement they are excellent for that you don't hear much about is a C- shaped pocket. These are the sort of placements where you can pull the trigger to shrink the cam down to get past the lobes guarding the bigger part of the crack and then expand it back up to a bigger size range inside the pocket. These are great and not something you can normally get good gear in if it doesn't have a wider opening off the side~ or you can finagle a nut in and turn it sideways. They are also really nice in cases where a flaring crack has a sweet size you need to find~ although i don't try to use them in an offset way.  I've got the smallest two sizes as well but don't really use them much anymore - as stated above those really do seem a bit fragile looking and I kind of want pro I have a lot of faith in below me when the going gets small. Maybe if we had more straight in splitters in my area I'd use them more though. There are just too many irregular cracks that would load them badly.  Mostly if you just use common sense and envision the fall line and how they will be loaded they work fine. Just remember that those long dangling links can create leverage and break things if your placement puts sideways pressure on them during a fall and avoid that. Sling them so they won't walk and don't try to make blind placements (this is good in general though!)  In the end~ I am sitting on my set of link cams now deciding at some point if get into aid climbing they may become really useful again.  ,Jul 2009,Jul 7 2017,1
3832,Omega pacific link cams,1,14," I was totally into these things and defended them to partners for a year until a gold pulled on Ghost Dance at Vedauwoo.  I nearly grounded and never used them again.  They give you a sense of totallyperfect protection.  It almost feels like you are ""pouring"" the cam into the crack and the contact area is amazing when all three levels are engaged.....but then what I thought was a perfect placement yanked and I was nearly killed.  My buddy Pete saved me with a classic Pete Rose belay and I retired them immediately.  Didn't even sell them because i wouldn't want that on my Karmic balance sheet if anything happened......",Aug 2008,Nov 27 2018,1

3839,Omega pacific link cams,2,0, The problematic/hilarious contradiction with Link Cams is that: 1) They are supposed to be useful as pieces that you can just haphazardly/desperately shove into any crack and they'll stick. But 2) If you don't place them just so (correct lobe expansion and no torsional loading)~ they explode. Like~ from small falls and even body weight~ Google it. I don't even buy into using them for anchors - a set of tricams will be more versatile and weigh less than even two Omega Pacific Splody Cams.,Aug 2013,Nov 27 2018,4

How big a whip~ what kind of placement~ what type of rock~ how's the precious cam doing after catching you're falling ass? Let's hear it so we can share in some first hand experience on how these things hold up over the long run.

3852,Totem Whips!,1,8, Whipped a couple times on a purple totem at the 10c roof crux of Bulletheads East in Squamish. The piece was pretty deep in an ever so slightly flaky and flaring placement at about thigh-level with an un-extended alpine draw. Obviously not a huge whip~ probably 5-8 feet with slack and rope stretch. Cam held like a champ~ but perhaps due to the grainy/crystal-y nature of the granite one lobe was slightly marred. Also took small falls on a red and a couple times on a blue in bomber placements without any wear on the lobes.,Oct 2017,Oct 24 2018,1
3853,Totem Whips!,1,9, This last Sunday I took a 10-15 footer in the middle of pulling the roof of P2 on Coffin Nail (Tahquitz / Granite / pretty perfect hand crack in a corner).  It was on the Orange Totem~ good placement but I popped it in a little blind~ maybe a tiny bit over cammed.  I was only a few feet above the placement but it was a thin-ish rope with what was probably a decent amount of rope out. Follower said the cam / placement looked great when he cleaned it and it still looks brand new.,Sep 2017,Oct 24 2018,0
3854,Totem Whips!,1,10, I've probably fallen more on my black totem than any other piece of gear. Now that I think about it~ more than any other piece combined pretty much. All ranging from 10-20' falls so no insane wingers and pretty low factor. I don't know how I should feel when I place it because on one hand it may be cursed~ but on the other hand~ it's caught me every single time!! I have one for backup when my current one kicks it but currently there are hardly any signs of wear besides a tiny bit of lobe gouging. Psyched on that piece as well as all the other sizes!!,Apr 2015,Oct 24 2018,2

3859,Totem Whips!,1,15, On Laurel~ a friend fell on the crux start~ and after I caught the fall~ the blue master cam held for a second~ but after he had stopped~ it popped. Luckily he landed on my bag which had a coat in it and padded his fall. He tried again~ this time placing the black totem in the same spot. He fell again~ again I caught him~ and this time the piece held. Third time was the charm and he sent. It wasn't a particularly long fall~ but he's a fairly big guy and there wasn't a lot of rope out~ so it was a fairly high-factor fall (F=0.8). The cams in question both look good as new besides normal nicks and scratches. A friend fell repeatedly (enough times that I don't remember how many times) on my yellow totem while working the crux of Nosedive. I took a small fall on the same yellow totem on Ken's Crack a few weeks back. The cam looks used but again~ just nicks and scratches~ no structural damage.,Jan 2017,Oct 24 2018,0
3860,Totem Whips!,1,16, I fell about fifteen feet on a blue totem basic~ protecting a certain groundfall~ from about twenty five feet up. (so~ >.5 fall factor.) Got a VERY hard catch from my belayer who took in slack. I think it's my hardest fall to date in terms of forces generated. (He must have taken pretty hard~ I could reach up on my tiptoes and pull the cam out from the ground for the redpoint after.) Anyways~ afterwards the cam lobes had some deformation~ but only superficially. They are the same shape~ and I have used the cam for a long time since then. No adverse effects~ still smooth~ straight and solid as ever.,Dec 2013,Oct 24 2018,0
3861,Totem Whips!,1,17, A couple years ago~ I was giving it a go on Baby Blue on Wall St (Moab) and fired a blue totem near the top before the crack starts pinching down. Ran it out a little bit and made it to the chains...only to find I forgot draws and had no other biners on me. Made the split second decision to just jump off. It was my friend's totem and we had a good laugh. Fun Times. Thanks Cameron~ for letting me whip on your gear!,May 2014,Oct 24 2018,2
3862,Totem Whips!,1,18, A couple of years ago I placed my brand new purple Totem in an overhanging outward flaring crack. I didn't think much of the placement so I had it backed up by a nut just below it. After deciding the runout a little farther up the climb wasn't really worth it~ I started downclimbing and cleaning. I popped off when I was probably 5 feet or less above the Totem~ and it kept me off the ground with the help of my excellent belayer. A couple of nice gouges in the lobes~ but nothing that would compromise performance. It's still a go-to piece.,Dec 2013,Oct 25 2018,0

3870,Totem Whips!,2,5, Placed a good purple totem under a roof. Pulled said roof then into a lieback crack for about 30ft to the chains. I just gunned it since it was pumpy and trying to place gear would be hard given the nature of the crack and your body position. As I reached for the anchor my foot blew and I took the longest ride I've ever taken. Between the rope stretch~ slack in the system~ and rope running through my belayer's device (he thought I was already there and wasn't as attentive as he should have been) I was almost at the bottom of the 120ft pitch when I stopped. Got to climb the whole thing again though~ which was cool since it was such a rad pitch. The cam looks great; couldn't even tell I fell on it.,Apr 2011,Oct 29 2018,9

3873,Totem Whips!,2,8," Warning~ thread deviation: As I think Ted P is suggesting~ does textbook ""placement""~ in the use of an over-arching term to describe the whole deployment process~ not include consideration of the rock it is placed in? Or in the strictest sense~ if placement only refers to the choice of where it is placed~ rock quality is still part of that. Really this is just semantics~ but perhaps you had textbook cam retraction and orientation etc~ but poor placement. Either way~ I'd like to hear more about the feature you placed it in that exploded; crack or flake~ course or fine~ any hollowness? Scary ride I'm sure! It looked like good rock~ perfect parallel goldilocks texture crack on what is usually bomber alpine granite~ i went off route so the surface rock was a bit decayed and crumbly but the rock underneath should have been good after 30 second of sitting on the cam talking to my partner about where to go a little chunk of the rock popped off the edge of the crack leaving me with like 3.5 cams in the crack and then like 10 seconds later im falling. ",Oct 2015,Oct 29 2018,0

3876,Totem Whips!,2,11, My only trad whip was on the red Totem. Lost in Space~ Hawksbill Mountain~ NC... fell with my feet at the level of the cam and a few feet to the right.  I took the same whip this guy did but 1) I didn't hang upside down and 2) my cam held~ despite not looking like a super solid placement. Gave me confidence to finish the move on the second go. You can see it in the pic below.,Jan 2008,Nov 1 2018,11
3877,Totem Whips!,2,12, While it seems to me like you're trolling~ there may be some truth in that. They have an effective camming angle lower than even metolius's 13.25 degrees~ which means that~ for a given downward pull they exert more outward force than any other cam. Not the greatest if you're climbing choss. In that regard~ an alien may be more appropriate with the 16 degree camming angle. Or even a tricam which has a non constant camming angle that is designed to exert less force the more the rock flexes. In fact~ tricams were actually developed specifically for sketchy desert flakes. ,May 2014,Nov 8 2018,0

3880,First Set of Half Ropes,1,0, Hi all~ I've done some research and narrowed my search down for my first set of half ropes and looking for some suggestions/direction. Would be using these ropes for a few areas - trad~ alpine & ice climbing. Ropes I'm considering are: Mammut Phoenix 8.0mm ($190)~ Sterling Evolution Duetta 8.4mm ($150)~ and the Mammut Genesis 8.5mm ($200). Are any a clear favorite here? From what I'm finding around the 8.5mm is recommended for you first set of halfs? I'm leaning towards the Sterling Duetta~ though its only rated as a half rope~ whereas the other two are both half/twin certified. What are the drawbacks here~ or would this really matter too much? I like the idea of the weight savings of the Mammut Phoenix~ but is 8.0mm a smart idea for a first half rope? (was also eyeing the Sterling Fusion which is 7.8mm if anyone recommends this too?) Feel free to chime in as well if you feel there's a rope I'm leaving out that better fits my needs! - Thanks,Sep 2017,Aug 31 2018,0
3881,First Set of Half Ropes,1,1, I've no experience with the Sterling ropes~ but I know the Mammut Phoenix are great ropes. I don't see why 8mm wouldn't be just fine as your first half ropes. Half rope technique is really not as difficult as people try to make it out to be.,Mar 2015,Aug 31 2018,0
3882,First Set of Half Ropes,1,2, I don't know why you would choose a half-technique-only rope when you can get other ropes that will allow you to employ either half or twin technique. The Phoenix ropes are wonderful--light~ compact~ and very nice handling. If you choose the Genesis~ they will probably be not only your first pair~ but your last~ since they are noted for their durability. On the other hand~ if you're going to work with ropes that large and heavy~ you might consider a triple-rated (half~ twin~ single) one instead. The Fusions are scary fast to rappel on~ even if your device is rated for 7.8mm--and many are not.,Nov 2006,Aug 31 2018,0
3883,First Set of Half Ropes,1,3, The Mammut Genesis 8.5 is great for rock climbing~ burly and durable. Also fairly thick so no qualms about climbing in group of 3 with a second on 1 rope.  Not being able to lead as either half or twin would be a deal breaker for me. I often switch techniques depending on what the pitch is like or who I am climbing with. ,Sep 2016,Aug 31 2018,4
3884,First Set of Half Ropes,1,4, I realize two pairs is a lot of $~ but I suggest keeping your ice climbing doubles dedicated to that purpose.  Abrasion on rock will eliminate their water repellency in a few pitches and make them really unpleasant to use on long ice routes. One way to reduce sticker shock is to use your doubles on ice for a couple seasons~ then re-purpose them for rock.  They will still be like new and will not have taken any falls.  Then get new ice ropes and keep rolling. Also~ I think you might consider how much you weigh.  I am 190lb~ and find 8.0mm or less a bit thin for rock.  I use 7.7 on ice (few edges~ and you don't lead fall on ice anyway)~ but Genesis 8.5mm on rock.  I am happy with those choices.  Genesis is much more durable than any other rope I've used recently.  I think it is reasonable do downsize a bit more if you weight less.,Oct 2004,Aug 31 2018,9
3885,First Set of Half Ropes,1,5,,Mar 2015,Aug 31 2018,3
3886,First Set of Half Ropes,1,6, Gonna vote for the pheonix .  I love mine and use them for rock and Ice without issue.  I core shot one recently on rappel due to falling rock~ but even a 10mm rope would have been toast. The low weight a good handling make them my favorite ropes.  I am sure the 8.5 is great too~ but the 8.0 is lighter and plenty burly.,Jan 2016,Aug 31 2018,0
3887,First Set of Half Ropes,1,7, Thanks everyone so far the responses! Every single one has been helpful and great advice. Seeing a lot of love for the mammuts to no surprise. I knew there’d be plenty love for the genesis as everything I’d heard previously about it~ but glad to hear some positive first hand testimonies for the Phoenix as I’ll probably prefer to go a little skinnier/lighter. Keep em coming though! ,Sep 2017,Aug 31 2018,0
3888,First Set of Half Ropes,1,8, I own the fusions and I love them. I use the MicroJul with them and haven’t had any issues with rappelling. They are really light. I’ve had people ask if I’m climbing on accessory cord they look so thin though haha. Solid ropes~ rated half and twin. ,Mar 2014,Aug 31 2018,0
3889,First Set of Half Ropes,1,9, I think you should consider the Mammut twilight 7.5. I’ve only just got mine and climbed on then a few times but they’re great~ handle well even in a reverso (just bought the microjul though). Super light-weight and i think they’re on sale right now.

3897,First Set of Half Ropes,1,17," to get full length raps without tagging You can do that with half ropes or twin ropes.  The question was why use half ropes in twin mode~ and the answer is ""it depends~"" because sometimes there are situations where half rope technique makes more sense~ and sometimes there are situations where twin rope technique makes more sense.  It's nice to have the flexibility~ if the ropes allow for it.",Mar 2015,Sep 6 2018,1

Sure~ I have occasionally used my doubles as twins for quick traversing pitches~ or a short technical pitch on a doubled-over half rope in alpine terrain~ etc~ but it is always a matter of convenience (e.g. keeping ropes a bit more neatly out of the way) rather than necessity.  You always have the option to clip them as doubles if you're worried about impact forces.  I have been climbing for 22 years almost exclusively on doubles (unless I am single-pitch-cragging) both on rock and ice~ and have used those doubles as twins perhaps 0.1% of the time...",Oct 2004,Sep 6 2018,0
3900,First Set of Half Ropes,1,20, If you want to consider a super-skinny~ triple-rated~ I'd recommend the Edelrid Canary~ 8.6mm.

3901,First Set of Half Ropes,2,0, Any other feedbacks about the Edelrid Canary 8.6? I'm planning on buying a half rope~ so my initial bet was going for the classic Mammut Genesis 8.5~ but when browsing I came across the Canary~ and because of a sale~ I can buy either for roughly the same price. It's triple rated~ so it's on the league of Serenity~ Switft and the like. But even then~ comparing it side by side with the Genesis (or even the Kestrels)~ other than having 2-3 extra g/m~ the Canary seems same or better in almost every aspect~ and durable as well (sheath 47%). And being triple rated! Does it make sense for using it as a main half rope? Any feedbacks from experience using ti? Or any comments about durability? Thx in advance!,Sep 2018,Sep 10 2018,0

3906,Evolv Generals,1,0," I am writing this review to hopefully provide some insight to those hard climbing tradsters that are interested in the performance side of these shoes. Most of the reviews I read prior to getting these babies were not very helpful at all in letting me know how they would climb. I will first say that I am skeptical of any high top shoe that is not the TC Pro. I owned a pair of Evolv Astromans for a while and though they performed well in a splitter crack setting~ trying to stand on any kind of edge in those things was an absolute nightmare. I also currently have a pair of Boreal Ballet Golds that I enjoy thrutching up wide cracks in Vedauwoo but in my opinion they are too stiff to be used when the climbing gets hard and you need to really feel what you are standing on. The TC´s are great both at face and crack climbing but one thing they lack is durability. In order to prevent the rand from peeling off almost immediately I have been forced time and time again to slather these shoes in seam sealer which is a little depressing for a shoe that retails at $180. I will say as a disclaimer that I got my pair of Evolv Generals for free as I somehow became a ""grassroots athlete"" by accident after sending a few emails. I would never have paid the $175 price tag on these things especially since I thought all they were going to be was another Astroman. This assumption was totally wrong~ but more of that later.  Sizing: I find most evolv shoes to be very frustrating to actually get your foot into. For some reason they design their shoes with an INSANELY tight heel rand that makes it difficult to size your shoe properly. I personally enjoy a very snug fit for any kind of hard climbing be it sport~ boulders~ or gear. I went into my local climbing shop to figure out what size I needed to order (I know a total scumbag move and I appreciate Bob Culp at rock and resole letting me try on shoe after shoe even though I didn´t buy anything). The nice thing about Evolv is that they are trying to steer their brand to fit close to your normal street shoe size~ thus preventing serious downsizing when trying to find the right fit. I wear a 10 in most street shoes and when I tried on the 10 in the Generals they fit great right away and I immediately knew this size was too large. When I downsized to a 9.5 I about broke my foot trying to get it into the model but it did finally go in. Perfect! When I went to go stand on some plastic footholds to try the edging power of the shoe I was surprised that what I felt under my foot was some stiff rubber that might actually perform on long~ hard routes in a way that makes sense. I do not recommend bringing tight shoes straight to your project~ especially if it is long and difficult~ so before I took these things outside I soaked them in some hot water and let my fit sit in them for about an hour or so. This made my painfully tight shoes stretch to their normal size and I was good to go.  Performance: I got these shoes mainly for summer alpine rock routes at Mount Evans and Rocky Mountain National Park. I had been wanting to ""level up"" to the harder routes on the Diamond for sometime and figured Bright Star (IV 5.11d R) was a good season opener seeing as how most of the hardware had been replaced last season. Before I took these shoes up to the ""Big D"" I decided to bring them out sport climbing for a weekend in Rifle to warm the rubber up. I slipped them on for a try on the old Anti-Phil (5.13b) and to my surprise they performed just as well on the tiny limestone edges as my overly aggressive sport shoes. The edging platform is very stiff~ much stiffer than the TC Pros~ but with a softer more high quality rubber than the Ballet Golds allowing the climber to really stand on some small stuff without much effort. Flash forward to last weekend on the Diamond. Now I knew Bright Star was going to be a ""real deal rock route"" but damn did I underestimate that beast! My friend Peter and myself employ a system of climbing where the leader leads and then fixes a rope for the second to follow on micro traxion thereby eliminating the need for transitions between pitches as long as the leader leads in blocks. I had the fortune of leading the first~ and most exciting block. My pitch breakdown was as follows: p1 5.11+ R~ p2 5.11b pg~ p3 5.11+R~ and p4 5.11+ very R. If I was gonna survive this ordeal~ which at a few times I wasn´t so sure that was going to happen~ then worrying about my shoes sticking to the rock was not an option. Not only did the Generals hold any small edge despite the constant shaking of my elvis legs~ but they inspired confidence in my movement no matter how far out I was from my last suspect placement. They performed equally well on thin faces and cracks but I could see thinner finger cracks being a weakness for this shoe~ but hey that´s what the slippers are for.  Bottom Line: These shoes kick serious ass. Pretty sure I will never buy another pair of TC Pros again (blasphemy?!). The edging abilities of the General far surpass those of the TC Pro in my opinion making them a granite face climbers dream. I am excited to see how they will perform on desert sandstone once the weather cools down but am confident that they will be great for anything thin hands and larger. I do not anticipate having to glop a ton of seam sealer on these things like I did on my TC´s as the rubber around the toe on the Generals is stiff and has shown no signs of wear thus far. For those not inclined to foot binding torture I would recommend sizing true to your street size and I´m sure they will still provide a high performance shoe option~ maybe just less so when the climbing gets really hard. Go and get yourself some!",Aug 2008,Jul 6 2018,6
3907,Evolv Generals,1,1, I can't believe you sized DOWN in any Evolv shoe. I always have to size UP at least 1/2 and sometimes 1 whole size. ,Jan 2016,Jul 6 2018,3

3909,Evolv Generals,1,3, I know crazy! In the aggros I had to go with my street size and even those were pretty tight. The generals seemed to stretch a good bit though so I think the downsize was justified. I honestly think that's the key to the performance differences you saw. I~ also~ own a pair of Astromans and I didn't find the Generals to be that much different.  I recently bought a pair of TC Pros so we'll see how I like them.,Jan 2016,Jul 6 2018,0
3910,Evolv Generals,1,4, I just got The Generals in my street shoe size..10 1/2.  I wear a 42.5 in TC Pros.  I wore The Generals in my hot tub before climbing the first time.  They were still too tight.  But then they molded to my foot after two days on rock.  Now they are by far the most comfortable shoes for hand and finger size cracks and also granite edging I have ever had.  And they seem very robust and durable too. But they are very stiff with no sensitivity and not too good at smearing.  Generals are still overall the greatest trad shoes.  I will never buy another pair of TC Pros.  Also note I can get a pro deal on 5.10 shoes...and I am still switching to Generals for general trad.,Sep 2013,Jul 6 2018,0
3911,Evolv Generals,1,5, Adding a +1 to the overall performance and comfort of these shoes. I have probably put about 15-20 pitches in on them and I feel they outperform the TC pro (which before this I had 2 pairs that each were resoled many times). I also sized up which I thought was weird~ but they are insanely comfortable. I noticed that the heel box is a little more roomy than my TCs~ which is odd~ but it hasn't seemed to affect they way I can edge or jam so its a non-issue at this point. I also noticed that they do well in smaller cracks than the TCs due to the more aggressive toe shape.  My only complaint with them~ is that the high tops catch a lot of debris when climbing manky pitches. The high tops are just a bit higher than the TCs so it makes fishing sticks~ pebbles~ and pine needles out of there a bit more difficult with the shoe still on. I am sold on these shoes for sure and will definitely buy another pair.,May 2015,Nov 12 2018,1
3912,Evolv Generals,1,6, I've been a big fan of The Generals. My thoughts are that they really perform fairly similarly to the TCs~ they just fit different sized feet better- a fact~ for which my wide feet are extremely grateful! After a little over 90 pitches on them in the past several months~ some of the stitching is coming apart and I've almost worn through the laces on my left shoe~ but I suppose that is to be expected with time and with the amount of large-hands to offwidth routes I've been doing lately. And it's pretty easy to buy some new laces (I also broke that left foot in May and had surgery~ so the swelling has probably made the shoe a bit tighter than it would otherwise be). All in all~ I'll definitely buy another pair of these in a couple years or whenever this pair is decidedly shot.,Jun 2016,Nov 12 2018,1

3931,Petzl Pur Ice vs. Ice vs. Cascade,1,8, I've been using them this past week and have found they are very easy to place (I've actually forgone the pick weights for the time being until I get used to the additional ease of placement) and even during those occasional deep~ tool vibrating placements they are still substantially easier to clean. Much easier than the petzl ice picks~ and of course still worlds better than cleaning a deeply driven BD pick.    I've found that this new pick angle has made transitions from stepped to vertical ice much easier with this slightly more relaxed pick angle. Once on a consistently steep angle~ I havn't noticed the need to alter my swing much compared to the original pick angle~ albeit there is slightly less of a need to dial that specific wrist flick for solid placements as has been needed with prior petzl picks.    Durability has actually been very surprising. After a week of rock strikes and frozen kitty litter New England top outs the picks are still quite sharp with just the external coating being worn away. Yes~ they are not T Rated and with this in mind I would be wary about doing any substantial torquing. These picks are highly recommended for pure (get it?) ice routes- just be willing to re-sharpen more often if your adventures are bringing you onto more mixed or alpine type terrain.,Jun 2010,Jan 23 2017,1

3934,Petzl Pur Ice vs. Ice vs. Cascade,1,11," Midway down through this review .... ""Pur’Ice is new for F[all]/W[inter]18~ though the only change is the addition of small spiky teeth on the head. Stock on the new Nomic~ it’s tapered to 3mm at the tip. With the most open angle of all the Petzl picks~ it’s designed purely for ice climbing. It places and cleans as well as any other pick I’ve used~ and is noticeably better to climb with on the Nomic than the Ice. Put it on the Ergonomic and it’s a featured ice dream machine. The preferred pure-ice pick for the Nomic and Ergonomic.""",Aug 2014,Nov 9 2018,0
3935,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,0, I have an opportunity to pick up the MH Nilas brand new for about $350 and am wondering if it's worth it? I'm looking for a very warm~ lightweight jacket for frigid belays/climbing and sub zero camping. I'm also looking at the Rab Positron Pro that was just released. I've read from some people that the Nilas wasn't as warm as they wanted and am wondering what the community's experience has been? Any thoughts or advice is appreciated. Thanks!,Nov 2017,Nov 2 2018,0
3936,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,1, $350 is a good price but with the upcoming holiday sales it will be easy to find lots of mid weight belay jackets in that price range. If it fits you well and you like the details go for it~ if you're concerned about the warmth then it's not hard to find alternatives with >7.5oz fill. ,Sep 2013,Nov 2 2018,0
3937,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,2, Whatever you get I’d make sure it has atleast one very large internal pocket for water or big mitts or both. Many seem to be lacking.,Dec 2012,Nov 2 2018,3
3938,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,3, Meh I got mine for like 200 and I still have it so I guess that counts for something.  Yup it's sewn through in the neck area and it has noticeable cold spots there.   IMO there are much better jackets on the market for less.  I wouldn't recommend it to people :(,Apr 2016,Nov 2 2018,2

3941,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,6, I have the nilas and love it. I definitely recommend it. The elastic cuff can be a bit annoying~ it requires me to take my gloves off before putting it on.,Jan 2018,Nov 2 2018,1

3943,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,8, The nilas is cool but I think the rab proton is probably better.  Or the Montbell permafrost.   I own the nilas as well as the  Patagonia fitzroy and grade 7.  I’ve used all to around -20 f and feel the nilas is likely the best overall of the 3.   If you want heavy weight go with the first ascent peak xv.    ,Nov 2007,Nov 2 2018,2
3944,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,9, Thanks for your responses everyone! Tom~ what conditions have you used it in? I’ve used it as a belay puffy for ice climbing~ and I bring it backcountry skiing / ski mountaineering if I know it’s going to be cold. I often don’t use it skiing but I bring it as my emergency “oh shit” layer. I’ve also used it on hut trips in BC and it was super handy for going to the outhouses because the nights there were very cold,Jan 2018,Nov 3 2018,1
3945,Is the Nilas worth it?,1,10," I owned the first generation Nilas a few years ago when it was first released & I sent it back after a few outings (when Backcountry had an unlimited returns policy) because I thought the hood was too small for a helmet/layers~ and 215 grams of down just wasn't warm enough for me.  If you want more bang for your buck~ I'd wait two weeks or so for Christmas sales and get the new Rab Positron Pro or the Montane Deep Heat Jacket.  Both have 300 grams of hydrophobic~ 800 FP goose down.  The Deep Heat may be a little ""warmer"" as the entire jacket uses box-baffle construction~ whereas the Positron Pro utilizes stitched-through construction in certain places and box-baffle in the torso~ hood.",Mar 2011,Nov 3 2018,1
3946,Fitness Tracker for Mountaineers,1,0, Hello~ I hope this message finds you well! I am a second year MBA students at University of Rochester and currently working with a startup as part of my coursework. Our major task at this point is to identify the application of the tracker in specific sports (the product can measure heart rate~ blood oxygen level~ etc.) such as mountaineering. I would highly appreciate if you could share your experience as it'll help us in narrowing down our focus. I have designed an online survey to gather data and I’d appreciate if you could share your response through the same. It’ll take max 10-15 min. Here’s the link: http://simon.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cuORa92zy4zyV4F Have a great weekend ahead! -Saniya,May 2018,May 5 2018,0
3947,Fitness Tracker for Mountaineers,1,1, Completed the survey so I figured I'd give you a free bump.  Best of luck with your research. To anyone thinking about taking the survey~ it took less than 5 minutes :),Jun 2012,May 9 2018,0
3948,Fitness Tracker for Mountaineers,1,2, Completed the survey! Bump!,Nov 2016,Jul 3 2018,0
3949,Fitness Tracker for Mountaineers,1,3," I have viewed your survey and decided to do an advance review of your product. Studies done by me at the coffee shop where I work show that one person out of 15 (the number of people in the coffee shop) know about my website. That means that 20 million people~ statistically~ view and know of my site in the US alone! Now~ I know as an MBA student~ you're very savvy~ and as a University of Rochester student~ you know that garbage plates are delicious late at night~ you know what I mean? Just trying to establish a little personal connection~ get some synergy going here. I am sure that~ together~ we can really get the hype up for what I'm calling (and so this has to be the name of the product): The #1 Best Mountaineering KodaKronometer and Blood Infusionator. When at first I saw the survey for a new mountaineering blood infusionator on Mountain Project~ I thought it was funny that businesses always use this site for market research~ considering the kinds of comments normally bandied about (the leader must not fall~ sport is neither~ there are mole people living in the abandoned subway system under Rochester). But I took the survey anyway~ and watched the accompanying strangely hypnotic video (since taken down~ for whatever reason)~ so I feel pretty comfortable reviewing the upcoming product~ since I will be spamming the survey with the features I want to see in my ""fitness tracker."" The review is to follow: When I hooked into the #1 Best Mountaineering KodaKronometer and Blood Infusionator~ I felt a rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins. That might have been the result of Dr. Stephen's proven ""energy formula"" that boosts metabolism rates~ improves lung capacity~ and gives its users prophetic visions of the future (only available with purchase of the #1 Best Mountaineering KodaKronometer and Blood Infusionator~ FDA approval pending). Next~ I checked the foldout screen on the watch. With it's direct satellite link to MountainProject.com~ I could track recent gear reviews~ find new posts about what kind of trad rack I should get~ and participate in the newest debate about goldfish at the crag (my take? Bad belayers~ but good if you forget your snacks or water bottle~ though I did get some goldfish water on my rope once~ and I'm not sure what the effects of that are. I retired the rope immediately for good measure). The watch also tracked my heart rate and time to completion~ using the patented HoldChipper algorithm to shave precious seconds off my time by skipping every fifth second~ always. That way~ I can save energy by moving slower while my watch records my time as if I was sprinting! Instant FKT. These features~ coupled with the fact that the #1 Best Mountaineering KodaKronometer and Blood Infusionator will play inspirational music for you the entire way up the mountain (Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" full volume on repeat~ no option to pause or mute so you can pump up all the other mountaineers you pass as you vibrate your way up the mountain~ an unfortunate side effect of Dr. Stephen's proven formula)~ makes the price tag on this baby ($400 but completely free to reviewers)~ completely worth it. Thanks Saniya! I'll have my lawyers contact yours so we can work out a promotional deal. You'll be able to see from my website that I operate under the strictest professionalism.

3950,Metolious Asymmetric curved Nuts,1,0, Back in March my rack got stolen~ and I picked these up to replace DMM offsets and BD sets. Now I’m carrying less nuts but they work very well. Totally dig the fact you can get a full set and all the sizes have a good Kn rating~ black~ the only one I remember right now has 9Kn which took about a 10 foot fall and was still easy enough to clean. Also work great supplementing gear in anchors~ pending conditions. I’ve gotta say I’ve thrown these things into some pretty funky placements~ slight tug to set it~ and would’ve felt good falling. Somehow have gotten them to stick in small scars on runouts with less of the safe feeling~ but at least there was something there when the scar was so shallow a totem wouldn’t even fit.  Only minor complaint I have is the wires are fixed~ so if you come across a bolt without a hanger~ you can’t slide the nut down the wire and clip it. So if anybody’s been wondering about these~ I’ll go ahead and say that they’re great nuts~ I use them very often and typically don’t leave the deck without them. Especially if I’m only carrying a single rack of cams~ or if I’m just climbing into the Valley. Cheers~ jeff ,Aug 2016,Oct 20 2018,1
3951,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,0, I don't own a huge amount of metolius gear.  A full run of tcus...  a nut tool~ a hangboard.  But every interaction I've had with this company has exceeded my expectations.  Their gear is all high quality~ Their cam resling service is the best~ hands down.  Cleaned and polished ~ lubed and reslung for $3... I wish they would do all my gear.  I recently had a 0tcu with some issues... the little plastic spacers (o-rings?) between the lobes and cables somehow turned to goop. Maybe the lube I used is the culprit... I admitted that could be it~ but they didn't care~ and they repaired it free of charge.  It's an 11 year old cam.  I had some further discussion about other products and feedback with them~ and got a suprise box of swag in the mail.  I'll be reviewing some of their Bravo carabiners soon. They're a great company~ make solid products~ and take care of their customers.,May 2010,Oct 10 2018,42
3952,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,1, I've had similar experiences~ they are the best. I have become a full-on Metolius hype boy when asked about their products~ cams especially.,Jun 2015,Oct 10 2018,3
3953,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,2, I love me some UL Mastercams,Dec 2016,Oct 10 2018,2
3954,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,3,  Best customer service of any company Ive ever delt with. Reslung 12 cams for 3$ ea. ($36) compared to BD $8 ($96) ~ washes your cams in a sonic bath returning your babies to you all sexy. Additionally~ I had a cam with a nylon trigger cable that got cut and since they couldnt replace it they sent me a brand new cam.. FNcraycray.  ,Sep 2006,Oct 11 2018,4
3955,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,4, I love UL powercams. They are so light and hold so well and are so durable. There are some cams that are objectively better~ but these still give me the most confidence~ almost like a sinker nut. Also great customer service. ,Jun 2006,Oct 11 2018,3
3956,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,5, +2 thumbs up! For similar reasons mentioned above.,Dec 2016,Oct 11 2018,3
3957,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,6, I greatly prefer TCU to the new ultralight master cam~ they are a hard cam to place when you are at all pumped. TCUs are work horses~ really good in blue-orange size.  They are also virtually the same weight as the master cam.  Prefer the discontinued C3 or original master cam for the size below blue~ and dragons for bigger sizes. ,Jul 2009,Oct 12 2018,4

3959,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,8, I've had a similar experience with Metolious. I sent back some gummed up~ janky TCUs and they came back looking new. That said~ I've never needed to send back any of my BD cams. ,Apr 2012,Oct 12 2018,3

3961,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,10, there's nothing quite like sinking their bomber cam lobes in a bomber crack. i prefer them over the bd X4's in the finger sizes. The black ultralight mastercam #5~ which i have as a double to the bd .75~ is possibly my overall favorite cam... the range finder and the sticky cam lobes have strong bite and set just so.  also shouts to their ultralight chalk bag~ the fs mini~ the bravo locker... their super chalk is cheapest on the market... much love to metolius! does anyone here wear any of their harnesses~ and have any opinions to share there? i need to get a new harness to looking at metolius offerings...,Sep 2015,Oct 12 2018,3
3962,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,11, I have the Safetec Deluxe. I've been pretty happy with it. One of the (not structural) straps that connects the leg loop to the waist band started fraying fairly quickly after I got it~ but I just taped it up and kept climbing. ,Apr 2012,Oct 12 2018,1
3963,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,12, I broke the cam stops on my zero Master Cam and Metolius replaced the lobes~ cleaned/lubed the cam and replaced the sling at no charge.  They are great to work with.  mountainproject.com/forum/t…,Feb 2015,Oct 12 2018,2
3964,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,13, The first cam I ever owned was a yellow mastercam bootied off chapel pond slab in the Adirondacks.

3968,Metolius Appreciation thread,1,17, I've made several converts out of people because of the red mastercam~ it seems like it would just be useless because of the size overlap with the green BD~ but it's narrowness makes it so good all the time. ,Jun 2015,Oct 13 2018,1

3974,Anasazi velcro,1,1, I have a pair half size smaller than street shoe and I find them pretty perfect. Suck it up! Haha just kidding~ everyone’s feet are different~ but I think you should give em a few more sessions. They will soften up a wee bit in the toe box.,Jun 2016,Oct 7 2018,0

3977,Anasazi velcro,1,4, I have worn 7.5 Mocs (they are supposedly part of the Anasazi line) pretty much since they first came out. Got a pair of the brown/tan Anasazi Velcros in that same size and essentially couldn't even get my feet into them.  I wear 8.5 dress shoe/ and 9 hiker/running shoes FWIW.,Jul 2009,Oct 7 2018,0
3978,Anasazi velcro,1,5, I feel the Anasazi Velcro does fit different from the moccs. I have Velcro right around my street shoe size~ and I found the first couple pitches a little uncomfortable. They have stretched nicely to accommodate my feet. I’d say give it some time.  Be wary if these are your first pair of five ten shoes though. I hear five ten shoes either fit people’s feet well~ or not at all. Something to consider,Apr 2017,Oct 7 2018,0
3979,Anasazi velcro,1,6, The Mocs are unlined leather~ the velcros are lined so whereas the Mocs will stretch in width a lot~ the VCS not so much. Besides~ shoe sizes are arbitrary..,Jul 2013,Oct 7 2018,0
3980,Anasazi velcro,1,7, The Anasazi Velcro never fit my feet.  The Verdon VCS fit my feet great.  Try a different style.,Sep 2013,Oct 7 2018,0
3981,Anasazi velcro,1,8, I wear the whole Anasazi line (Mocs~ Pinks~ Tans~ Blancos~ Pros) 1 whole size down from my street shoes...they are a perfect fit for my foot~ the lace ups a little better since my heel is narrow and can be loose in the VCS.  If you’re having trouble with street shoe size it might just not be a good match for your foot.,Jul 2014,Oct 7 2018,0

3983,Anasazi velcro,1,10, I have the Anasazi VCS in my street shoe and for the first month~ I couldn't wear them for more than a half hour in the gym or climbing sport.

3990,How to choose the best climbing pack?,1,5, Back Packs; the best are gear - the worst are tote bags.  There is a wide range in between~ all have their place depending on circumstance. The right tool for the task is the key to solving the question of which choices need to take priority. Things like - How far will you be walking? number of climbers in the party~ conditions~ needs etc.  For years at the Gunks~ you could get by without a big sack; parking on the side of the road~  400yrds across the street from the cliff.  We would take a fanny pack or messenger bag with food water & stuff~ carry the rope (in a bag?) & gear~  so there was very little need for a pack.  When that all changed~ the best plan was still to try to go in with 1 pack for 2/3 people~ and personal day packs for 'needs'. In the real world of approaches~ how a pack carries at various weights has been what I care most about. The packs accumulated over the decades share most of the same features. Weights & sizes vary  a color that allows clear vision in dim light~ is a must~ adjustable straps~ sternum and side stabilizing Sturdy double bottom~ not compromised by a zipper~ a top pocket~  I like a detachable top(brain)~ and a pad sleeve along with a removable hip belt. My wife climbed more alpine~ so often went bigger(55L-80L~ & carried a day pack) A secondary access option~ other than just top load is nice~  cragging~ just long-day~ rock climbing I found that I didnt use them as much. Mason Stone~  our friend Henrik has a very Germanic mindset & presence.  He is comfortable in his own skin~ has a command of English & the facts. His strong opinions are based on personal experience & he feels the need to share this expertise here in this climbing arena. For the most part his presentations are excellent & his (Austrian?) demeanor is not at all unusual.  He is foreign~ different to you.,Apr 2014,Oct 10 2018,2
3991,How to choose the best climbing pack?,1,6, Of course I am serious :)...I am looking for advice from other people about what they believe are the right features for a climbing pack. I could have listed my thoughts in text~ but I believe that video is a much better way to convey a message like that - and something that is very relevant for a lot of people. As long as it helps people making the right choice~ then I would not consider it spam ;),Mar 2018,Oct 10 2018,1
3992,How to choose the best climbing pack?,1,7, You posted before I could answer your friend. If you are looking for advice you may want to hear what they have to say before sharing your truth. Otherwise you come off as providing spam. By using youtube you further come off as wanting for people to hit the like button and enhance your youtube channel. Great to hear that is not the case. I agree with color being a criteria for choosing a pack but function and form are more important~ although I would only choose white if I was hunting or in the military.,unknown,Oct 10 2018,2

3997,BD camalot new 2019,9,0, I know they havent come out yet but i saw a video on weigh my rack of the new bd camalots. Design hasnt changed much~ however they have a trigger stay~ so when you are racking up you can keep them cammed at 90%? This saves space~ probably not worth it until you get into the 3s and up~ but am i alone in thinking this will wear out the return spring in the cams~ ya know that thing that applies pressure to keep them seated?,Oct 2017,Oct 10 2018,0

3999,BD camalot new 2019,9,2, Previous discussion on new camalots:https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114462770/new-bd-camalot I'm guessing it won't wear out the spring. I'm assuming folks won't store them in that state~ and even if they did it shouldn't affect the life of the spring.,Jul 2012,Oct 10 2018,0
4000,BD camalot new 2019,9,3, Also lighter than the old BDs which is nice. Good compromise I suppose~ I would assume that would make them weigh in similarly to the Wild Country Friends,May 2015,Oct 10 2018,0
4001,BD camalot new 2019,9,4, Springs are not worn out when compressed. Springs are worn out by compression and decompression~ so using the cam over time will cause normal wear on the spring (spring fatigue) but keeping it compressed should not. Spring creep can occur when under extreme conditions~ such as high temperatures or when loaded beyond it's normal range. ,Jun 2017,Oct 10 2018,6
4002,BD camalot new 2019,9,5," In order to ""wear out"" the spring~ the strain would have to overcome the yielding strength. Spring steels generally have a very high yield strength~ allowing allows objects made of spring steel to return to their original shape despite significant deflection or twisting. Fatigue isn't really an issue in steel. You could potentially ""wear out"" the springs by getting them hot enough to ruin the heat treat/temper~ but I doubt anyone's cooking their cams in ovens hot enough to do that.",Jul 2012,Oct 10 2018,0

4009,La Sportiva Tarantula Climbing Shoes Review,1,0, It is not secret that I have a preference for high quality – great performance gear and when it comes to footwear I always want to have the best possible shoes. This is the case for my first pair of climbing shoes~ the La Sportiva Tarantula.Read full review here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2018/09/28/la-sportiva-tarantula-climbing-shoes-review/ Prior of deciding which climbing shoes I wanted to use for my climbing~ I have searched on various brands~ but once again~ I ended up buying a product from La Sportiva. The very first thing I always look at is how easy it is to get the shoe on – some are remarkably difficult and time consuming but the La Sportiva Tarantula slips on easily thanks to its laces free design. The way the fastening system works is very clever too thanks to a well thought out adjustment method which features opposite side locking straps that can move up and down as well as to tighten and loosen.,Oct 2017,Sep 28 2018,1
4010,La Sportiva Tarantula Climbing Shoes Review,1,1, First~ a little hopefully constructive criticism~ this reads like an add written by someone with little knowledge of climbing shoes disguised as a review.

4018,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,0,,Jun 2017,Jul 6 2018,4
4019,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,1, They shouldn't be used in all applications~ every carabiner has a special purpose. The NineteenG are great for racking~  I wouldn't use them for anything else. The Nano 22 are good for racking and so far alpine draws too.  The Photon Locks are great for anchors and the basket is big enough for a clove but not a munter. ,Jun 2017,Jul 7 2018,1
4020,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,2, They shouldn't be used in all applications~ every carabiner has a special purpose. The NineteenG are great for racking~  I wouldn't use them for anything else. The Nano 22 are good for racking and so far alpine draws too.  The Photon Locks are great for anchors and the basket is big enough for a clove but not a munter.  I would have to agree with this. The 19 is sooooo small~ I could never clip it with any kind of a pump on. Actually I find the Mad Rock Ultralight to be the smallest carabiner I can comfortable clip all the time. The Mad Rock has a gate opening of 23mm and the BD Neutrino has a 22mm gate opening~ which is my other racking carabiner~ and I find that to be about the minimum opening for comfortable clipping. I think also the depth of the basket has something to do with how the carabiner feels~ and how easy it is to clip. ,Jul 2015,Jul 12 2018,1
4021,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,3, I've noticed differences in how various lightweight biners deal with rope movement. Some biner designs are much better at avoiding crossloading. For example~ the discontinued DMM Shield (admittedly not lightweight by today's standards) is very hard to crossload and has a natural tendency to flip into a long axis orientation. Lightweight biners are more susceptible to rope movement from clipping or climbing than heavier biners~ and then it is up to the design to prevent the lightweights from getting hung up on a sling in a weak-axis loading position. Another difference between designs is how well two biners mate when opposite and opposed. Have you seen a difference between the 19G and the Nano21 in their likelihood to get hung up on a skinny sling in a crossload position?,Apr 2003,Jul 12 2018,0
4022,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,4, I’m only using the Nineteen g’s for racking but I haven’t noticed any of the nanos changing orientation while using. But a few times~ while extending~ I’ve gotten a couple snags on the ends of the wires. I might take some 1000 grit sandpaper to smooth those edges a little. The nano 22 are thinner in the middle and have a little belly in the spine~ I think this gives them good balance and helps prevent crossloading,Jun 2017,Jul 14 2018,0
4023,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,5, The cross loading deal is why I switched all of my wires out to either the BD hood-wire or my favorite~ right now~ the DMM Alpha wire. There is no notch to snag on a bolt or on the wire of a nut. That worries me more than just crossloading actually. An biner can break under a very small load when levered like a nose hook / gate open situation.,Jul 2015,Jul 14 2018,0

4025,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,7," I have a bunch of the 22s. Been using them since became available here. I use them on gear end of draws and slings. To me they operate better than other micro biners. I have some 19s that have seen some ""action"" but they are not easy to operate for me. The gates get sticky on the 22s. I find I have to lube them more than any other biner. I have retired some photon wire gates for this reason. I like the 22s enough to put up with it.",Nov 2017,Sep 18 2018,0
4026,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,8, Anyone have thoughts on the Edelrid Mission? 25g with a large gate opening.,Apr 2003,Sep 18 2018,0
4027,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,9, Can you comment on the durability of the Photon lockers? I have a handful of Trango Superfly screwgates~ which are supposed to be 45g and are nice to use~ but I noticed last night that one has a significant groove worn in the basket after no more than a day or so as part of a toprope anchor. Like 1-1.5mm of material lost. ,Oct 2017,Sep 25 2018,0
4028,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,10, I wouldn't choose to use a photon as a TR anchor. That's one place where a more robust biner is warranted. ,Jan 2016,Sep 25 2018,1
4029,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,11, I wouldn't choose to use a photon as a TR anchor. That's one place where a more robust biner is warranted.  I should probably just use one of the round-stock Petzl ovals I snagged for $4 at REI a few weeks ago.,Oct 2017,Sep 25 2018,0
4030,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,12, Yes~ that's a perfect TR biner. ,Jan 2016,Sep 25 2018,0
4031,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,13, To reduce wear on TR lockers~ put a small non-locking biner in between the two. Then it’s cheaper to replace a little wiregate. That is~ if you don’t feel like buying more robust lockers~ but a good tenchique nonetheless,Jul 2013,Sep 25 2018,1
4032,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,14, Why have a lightweight TR biner? Just use one of the old heavy screws in your collection. (unless you are new to climbing~ then just buy a cheap big biner),Oct 2017,Sep 26 2018,0
4033,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,15," Look no further than the Wild Country Helium for a light biner. Too steep? CAMP Photon non-wire. Avoid those ""snag nose"" biners at all costs.",Apr 2004,Sep 26 2018,1
4034,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,16, The cross loading deal is why I switched all of my wires out to either the BD hood-wire or my favorite~ right now~ the DMM Alpha wire. There is no notch to snag on a bolt or on the wire of a nut. That worries me more than just crossloading actually. An biner can break under a very small load when levered like a nose hook / gate open situation. We just switched all of our lightweight biners out to hood-wires also. Exactly what you described happened to my husband and the biner broke. Turned what should have been a nothing fall into a 25-30 footer from above a roof into a slab. He inverted and hit head first - thank god he had a helmet on. 6 pitches up with 2 left to go. It could have been a bad situation. Mammut biners (the model is escaping me). But yes~ we think the notch caught on the bolt and it was on a skinny sling. ,Sep 2010,Sep 26 2018,0
4035,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,17, FWIW I have settled on the Nano 22s as striking the sweet spot between light and still functional. I end up fumbling the 19Gs and the additional weight is therefore not worth it. I have a bunch of BD OZ  as well which are in the 28g range~ but I don't find them any easier to handle with than the Nanos~ although the hood is nice.  The Mammut Wall Light is similar size and weight at 23g or so~ and I have a couple on my rack but I find them just slightly smaller and not as easy to handle as the Nanos.  And another vote for the Grivel Plume locker. ,Dec 2015,Sep 26 2018,1
4036,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,18, I picked up some of the 19s to check out~ and as others mentioned found them too small to use for the rope end of anything.  I have pretty large hands and they become hard to orient or just get a hold of.  I have put them to use for racking and for the gear side of alpine draws.  As a recent experiment I have swapped them out for the gear side of a few ultralight quickdraws I have.  I've found that especially on bolts they are not as difficult to manage clipping gear as they are grabbing to clip the rope.  Another vote for the Nano 22 as the everything else non-locker.  Pretty curious to check out the Grivel Plume now~ too.  ,Dec 2016,Oct 2 2018,0
4037,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,19," My ultralight/small biner experiment is over after my trip to Colorado. I don't care how much weight they save me~ they suck. I have Nano 22 and the Edelrid 19. They will be used as accessory biners from now on....for stuff like holding a water bottle or shoes. They just are too small for my meat hooks~ and made me fumble around like a spaz trying to get gear and the rope clipped/unclipped. They also have a notch for the wire that can catch on bolts/wires~ especially since they are so small.   The smallest biner I will entertain now is a BD Neutrino. For all of my cams (C4/Dragon/Metolius UL) I am using full sized snag free wire gates like CAMP Dyon~ DMM Alpha Trad and WC Helium. I just match the cam color to the biner. All of my alpine draws are getting new biners~ I have a whole slew of Petzl Spirits and DMM Shadows just sitting around....heavier but also easy to clip. I guess they won't be ""Alpine light""~ but I don't really care. I also carry eight or so 12 inch draws that are floppy~ but still capture one biner. Not stiff like a sport draw. All full sized biners (Petzl Spirit and BD Hoodwire. I have a bunch of neutrinos I can use as spares.",Jul 2015,Oct 3 2018,0
4038,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,1,20, Buck~ I'm a big fan of the Photons for that reason. Not much heavier than the nanos but so much easier to handle. ,Jan 2016,Oct 3 2018,1
4039,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,2,0, DMM Alpha Light is my favorite. They're light~ easy to handle~ and easy to clip. They also come in racking colors so you can get OCD with your gear. Wait for a 25% off sale and you're in business. I also like the the BD OZ  and the Edelrid Pure line of biners.,Sep 2017,Oct 3 2018,1
4040,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,2,1, That is my current favorite as well.  I should have gotten more when they were on sale. DMM makes good stuff. They are super easy to clip~ and light enough for trad~ but burly enough for sport draws.,Jul 2015,Oct 3 2018,1
4041,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,2,2, I built all my alpine draws and sling biners for extending pro with BD Oz. Small but not too small and I like the hood and quality. I use the camp nano 22 for racking my cams and some neutrinos for my stoppers. All pretty light. I could see many good options in all these posts. My choices were based on value (low weight for reasonable to me cost). I just use BD Positron screw gate lockers for now but may add some lighter lockers for my alpine setup.,Jan 2017,Oct 3 2018,0
4042,Lightweight Biners: Nano 22~ Photon Lock~ Nineteen G,2,3, Trango Superfly lockers are~ to me~ a good value. I almost never use a locker on a lead~ mostly just for TR setup.,Jul 2015,Oct 4 2018,1
4043,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,0, Hi guys~ I'm new to the forums~ and would like to begin with a simple question regarding two brands of mountaineering equipment~ namely Mountain Equipment and Mountain Hardwear. I'm actually looking at purchasing a down jacket from one of them~ but my question is; How do these brands compare with one another.. is one generally known to be of better quality than the other? Carry more respect? Does one~ generally speaking~ produce the better down jacket? Are they much of a muchness.. a bit like photographers arguing whether Nikon or Canon produce the better cameras? (the answer to that is Canon by the way~ lol) I'm just basically trying to gain a little knowledge regarding the two brands so that I can make a more informed decision as to which might be the better brand to go with? Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you for reading ,Jan 2018,Sep 15 2018,0
4044,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,1, Mountain Equipment is a company based in the UK. They have been around since the early 60s. They are well known and make good gear~ primarily clothing. In the early years they were the English gear company for cold weather expeditions. Mountain Hardware is a company based in the USA. They have been around since the early 90s.  They are well known and make good gear~ clothing and tents. They are probably as much a fashion brand as they are a functional brand. I have owned gear made by both and would not hesitate to buy either brand.,Jul 2007,Sep 16 2018,6
4045,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,2, I'd look at the features and specs of the particular jacket and decide~ both companies have high end stuff that doesn't suck. Any particular reason you narrowed it down to those two? ,Sep 2013,Sep 16 2018,0
4046,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,3, Ive never owned anything from ME but I have about a dozen pieces of clothing from MH and I love them~ mostly because they fit my build~ and I like the styling.

4050,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,7," Hi Kathy~ the answer is Sony. :) I own both brands and I think they have better options for specific use. For instance I have a ghost whisperer from MH that serves a function that ME has not a good ""nemesis"".  (Also consider fit) and ME HAS some sick tech combined with usability . If you tell us what the use or need~ we may be able to assist you better. E.g my wife and I just went over a shopping spree as we are going to Canada~ qc for the winter.

4051,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,8, Mountain Equipment generally sticks to making mountain equipment. That is~ the stuff that is truly necessary for equipping yourself in the mountains. Personally~ I think that some of the mountain equipment they make is a bit underappreciated~ and should be explored by the serious mountain equipper. My favorite is the Mountain Equipment Explorer Card. This card gives you the tools you really need to be safe in the mountains: a credit card with no limit and only 12%APR after a 12-month trial period.** With the Mountain Equipment Explorer Card~ no piece of gear or summit bid is out of reach. You'll be able to get the gear you need every single time. It's like a nice toprope-assisted dyno to the deadpoint. But there's more! It comes with perks like $1 off at the Starbucks in the downtown Denver REI.*** This is a woefully underappreciated piece of kit from Mountain Equipment that all serious outdoor enthusiasts should look in to. You could probably buy a down jacket with that. I suggest the Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer~ for obvious reasons.**** ** Before the 12-month period is up~ the Mountain Equipment Explorer Card will need proof of a 5.12 send on gear with sufficient runouts in order to qualify for 12%APR. Otherwise~ the APR will be calculated by subtracting the grade you onsight from 100.  *** Provided that you mill about with the coffee in your hand~ staring at things on the REI wall like an art critic contemplating a Brueghel. ****Ghosts generally have the best beta.,Sep 2018,Sep 30 2018,3

4053,Mountain Equipment or Mountain Hardwear?,1,10, Briggs~ I have a dri down review forthcoming. I will tackle that very question.

4074,Wild country REVO,1,13, Seems like a good candidate for aid soloing~ a lot less bulky than a Silent Partner and probably wouldn't kink the rope as bad either. I'm sure they will say it's not intended for soloing but I'd still give it s go.,Apr 2012,May 28 2016,0
4075,Wild country REVO,1,14," From what I can see it looks like the device works like any tube device normally. You can catch a fall without locking the device~ which is nice.   The auto lock feature looks like it only engages once a revolution~ so it can also potentially provide a ""soft"" catch. Or at least softer than an Grigri~ depending on where the cam is positioned on the wheel when it needs to lock.   It also looks like the unlock feature is really intuitive: you just pull the rope down into the normal braking position.   This is a really cool device. Also~ quick google search shows Wild Country has info in their website now: wildcountry.com/revo/   Also looks like some retailers are predicting a price similar to a Grigri~ but that could be meaningless.",Feb 2016,Jun 1 2016,0
4076,Wild country REVO,1,15,,Oct 2015,Jun 1 2016,0
4077,Wild country REVO,1,16, My analysis was based on US retail pricing. Grigri = ~$100~ and I saw the £80 price~ and another retailer advertise $100.   But it's meaningless because Wild Country hasn't announced a price yet. Pure speculation pretty much. This could go for the same as a CAMP Matik~ or more for all we know.,Feb 2016,Jun 1 2016,0
4078,Wild country REVO,1,17, Regardless of price~ this device is seemingly one of the best of its kind so far. I love the atc but this could be a new move for me.

4089,Wild country REVO,2,7, To release~ from what I see you have to pull the rope to the normal braking position. Watch the exploded view video Wild Country has and you can see this.    My guess is he was able to release it~ but didn't pull hard enough to keep it braking~ so it went around another revolution and locked. Definitely a learning point with the device if true.,Feb 2016,Jun 3 2016,0
4090,Wild country REVO,2,8, If you look at the original instagram photo you can see what looks like a little black lever. I'm pretty sure that lever is used to release it from the locked position without having to unweight the device.,Apr 2011,Jun 3 2016,0

4092,Wild country REVO,2,10, Maybe? To me it looked like the belayer was hanging on the rope and the climber got back on the wall faster than expected. His left hand didn't appear to touch the device~ and his right is locked off.,May 2016,Jun 3 2016,0

4095,Wild country REVO,2,13," since it unlocks by pulling the rope into the normal ""locked"" position~ I'd expect you need to set it up where you're above the device - just like a directly belay with a regular atc. Also~ it seems to me the locking feature on this device is secondary. It's advertised as ""anti-panic""~ and it's seems the device can catch a fall without locking. I wonder how durable it will be if the auto-locking feature was used consistently.",Feb 2016,Jun 10 2016,0

4097,Wild country REVO,2,15, To me it acts like a car sit belt. Once engaged will not release until the pressure is not gone. It will be interesting to see how it acts after a fall when the leader is heavier than the belayed or lowering faster with out engaging the auto lock.,unknown,Jun 10 2016,0
4098,Wild country REVO,2,16," in my opinion~ device is cool~ I just don't like teeth-rib parts. the wheel is made of aluminium~ so the ribs will quickly wear. Looks like the only braking part of device~ when lowering~ are two V-ribbed parts on the top of device~ one only will brake~ while the wheel will rotate~ and I don't like this. The wear of the rope is critical~ and if the lowering is to fast~ the centrifugal trigger will be quite noisy~ trying to catch V-ribbed part.    ""soft"" catch? no way~ but it is really important?!   rappelling? no way~ but it is really important?!   one year re-certification? definitely yes! if not the device is potential danger.   would you accept re-certification each year? for me is OK to have regular service on device like this.",Sep 2014,Jun 10 2016,0

4111,Wild country REVO,3,9, I can tell you from personal experience (R&I weekend whipper~ I was dropped via Grigri) that when your belayer tries to hold the rope~ it will burn their hand and they will let go. In other words at the point of burnt hands~ this device will lock. The device seems actually quite simple~ it uses a inertia lock system like a car seat belt. Certain things have to happen for it activate obviously. As far as feeding slack~ how fast you can pull before it locks~~~ I think that remains to be seen.,Mar 2015,Jul 14 2016,0

4114,Wild country REVO,3,12, Forgive my ignorance~ but maybe someone who understands the device better can clear this up for me.   It looks like to disengage the lock~ you pull the rope to the regular brake position. Does this mean that if the rope is already held in the brake position~ the auto lock will not engage? It seems like it wouldn't need to~ but I'm wondering if it would.   Personally~ I'm much more interested in this than the new Grigri~ but I'd need to see how it handles feeding slack quickly and lowering first. Looks very promising.,Apr 2016,Jul 21 2016,0

4128,Wild country REVO,4,6, According to a sales rep I emailed~ it will be available in the US in March.   I'm not sure I would use as a belay device (ATC works just fine for me and those I climb with). However for TR soloing it looks like it could be the holy grail. From the descriptions/videos it appears to tick most/all the desired functions to make solo TRing a seamless experience:   1) feeds easily   2) can't be loaded wrong - catches fall on either end of rope   3) can easily down-climb without it locking (this has been lacking in all the devices I've used so far)   4) once locked by a fall or weighting it~ it unlocks by pulling on the free strand and lowers just like an ATC. No separate device needed.    5) no need for a chest harness to hold it in a vertical position for easy feeding and it seems like it could handle inverted falls without the chest harness (similar to Silent Partner)   Something that remains to be seen is how much weight is necessary on the end of the rope in the beginning to get it to self-feed (until the weight of the rope is enough).   In my experience of using many different devices for solo-TRing~ you either get an integrated lowering capability but less desirable feed (Grigri)~ or easy feeding but need a separate device for descending (mini/microTraxion and Microcender)   Of course the actual proof will be once it's available and people start testing it for this type of application. Also one still needs some type of back-up system - YMMV.   According to the sales rep~ solo TRing will not be a mentioned/approved use in their documentation similar to the Grigri~ etc.,Dec 2012,Aug 1 2016,0

It doesn't look like is can be easily dis-assembled by the user - which is probably a good thing. I theorize that the bushings will be the first thing to go - not sure what the estimated MTTF (mean time to failure) is.   It's probably made by DMM?

4144,Wild country REVO,5,2, I don't like it~ for all the same reasons other people complain about the Grigri.   This device catches falls without any reliance on the belayer's brake hand. Over and over in that video~ when he simulates a catch by the device~ you can see that there's slack between the brake hand and the device.    That means that any belayer that learns on one of these~ or becomes accustomed to one~ will be used to falls getting caught without their brake hand doing any work at all. They'll be completely unaccustomed to keeping the brake hand on the brake line~ or doing any work at all in a catch.,Mar 2006,Sep 1 2016,0

4152,Wild country REVO,5,10, Here's a thought.    The grigri~ cinch~ megajul~ etc etc can easily be used for bumping up a rope in the event your climber needs to boink. In doing so~ the device locks each time and the belayer can continue or hang until they're high enough up the rope to safely allow the climber to boink and generate slack.   Theoretically~ how do you suppose this would work with the Revo? Doing this with a standard tube device is no fun~ but it works because there is a bend at the biner to help lock it down. Do you think the jaws on the revo will have enough holding power? Or will the belayer have to continually drop themselves onto the device to get it to lock up and hold their position?,Jan 2010,Dec 8 2016,0

4177,Wild country REVO,6,15, Yes~ most definitely. At least for TR soling. Don't know re lead soloing. I suppose it partly depends upon the strength of the device. No~ not definitely.  For top rope soloing you are probably better off using one of the commonly used TR solo devices.  For example~ the Petzl Mini-trax~ Trango Vergo~ modified GriGri~ Rock Exotica Soloist... the list goes on. The Revo will be a lot like the Silent Partner.  It doesn't lock until the rope is zipping through it at a certain speed (i forgot what speed the Revo locks).  So if you use the Revo~ or Silent Partner as a TR solo device~ you could fall quite a ways before it locks.  This is why the Silent Partner is/was not recommended for use as a TR solo device.  It was created as a lead solo device only.     Even if the Revo were to lock up quickly~ it still wouldn't be ideal for TR soloing since it will have much more drag than say a micro-trax.   If you are holding out to buy the Revo for TR Soloing you are going to be disappointed.  On the other hand~ if you are looking for a smooth feeding super safe device that can still catch you even if your belayer is a complete idiot~ then the Revo looks pretty promising.  It could work as a LEAD solo device too~ but I'm not holding my breath.,Mar 2015,Apr 18 2017,0
4178,Wild country REVO,6,16, Great points...  I think this quote is where most of us are so far as excitement.  I use Gri Gri's~ but never bought one~ especially after I witnessed a noob misuse his~ dropped his leader on his head~ broken neck~ and the leader had a fractured heel.  Plus a few other near misses.  Only take a GG belay from a handful of partners who I know are skilled in the art.,Aug 2006,Apr 18 2017,0
4179,Wild country REVO,6,17," It all depends upon what you want and ones experience and the level of comfort with each situation and the technology at hand. I've tried most TR solo devices out there some are better than others but it depends upon the intended use and your comfort level with it. If I were ""working"" some moves at or above my RP level~ then a microcender or mini-trax is good because of the positive lock without loosing much vertical ground. Same could be said it one were climbing with a lot of objective hazards to hit on the way down. If I'm just wanting to do laps and gain milage~ then having something like a modded Grigri is good because you can lower as soon as you reach the top without having to switch devices. However it doesn't feed as well as some of the others. If little drag is one of your prime concerns~ then the Camp Gremlin is ideal with two different modes of use. The Revo~ as mentioned~ needs at least one revolution before it will lock. While for some that may be too much~ it would seems not too much different than the auto-bely devices that I've climbed on it gyms. At least with my light weight I fall a couple feet before it builds up the speed to slow the lowering rate. If I were just wanting to do a lot of laps it would seem to be an ideal choice but time will tell. Potentially ideal (for me) because it behaves like a normal tube belay device for rapping/lowering as soon as you reach the top.  It remains to be seen how much drag there is with the Revo for trailing on the rope. From videos I've seen it seems like little but could be wrong.",Dec 2012,Apr 18 2017,0

At least with my light weight I fall a couple feet before it builds up the speed to slow the lowering rate. The Revo won't lock unless the speed is above a threshold (I don't remember what that threshold is).  Once it hits that threshold~ the Revo may or may not have to complete 1 revolution before it catches.  Say the threshold is 2 m/s then you would have to fall a minimum of 0.2m before your fall speed would be 2 m/s (no big deal).  But if that threshold is higher~ say 5 m/s then you would have to fall a minimum of 1.27m (4.16 ft) before it would catch.  If there is much rope drag through the Revo that distance could be significantly higher (since acceleration would be lower).  This is of course not including rope stretch. I'm not saying the Revo (or the SP) wouldn't work for TR solo~ or that it would be unsafe~ just that it isn't ideal.  Why would you want your TR solo device to drop you 4 ft +? If I were just wanting to do a lot of laps it would seem to be an ideal choice but time will tell. Potentially ideal (for me) because it behaves like a normal tube belay device for rapping/lowering as soon as you reach the top.  What's wrong with a Trango Vergo (or even a Cinch).  it works great for lowering or rappelling~ has very little drag~ locks instantly~ is available now~ and is cheaper and lighter than the Revo will be. It remains to be seen how much drag there is with the Revo for trailing on the rope. From videos I've seen it seems like little but could be wrong. Yes it does remain to be seen~ but I can't imagine any way it could have less drag than a Shunt~ Micro-trax~ Vergo~ Cinch... or any of the other commonly used devices except for possibly a modified GriGri.  The reason is that the rope has to bend 180 degrees as it enters or exits the Revo. If you want to use the Revo for a TR solo device~ go for it~ my very rough guess is that it will be safe (with a backup of course).  I'm just saying that it is probably not the ""ultimate"" TR solo device.",Mar 2015,Apr 18 2017,0

4183,Wild country REVO,7,1, Looks like it could be pretty bitchen for aid soloing. I'd imagine it would be much more promising for roped solo free climbing. I don't see how it would be any better than a grigri or eddy for aid soloing because paying out slack isn't an issue when you're aiding because you're moving so slow anyways.,May 2014,Apr 18 2017,0

I don't see how it would be any better than a grigri or eddy for aid soloing because paying out slack isn't an issue when you're aiding because you're moving so slow anyways. True you move slower but I have used both the grigri and the Silent Partner for aid solo and neither are perfect though the SP is better than the Grigri.   It seems the Revo will feed easier and smoother and probably put less twists in the rope which is sometimes a pain with the SP.   Just because yer not moving fast aiding doesn't mean you don't want a smooth feeding device~ plus when you have to bust out some free moves during a pitch this would be pretty nice.,Apr 2012,Apr 18 2017,0

4192,Wild country REVO,7,10, I personally would just use the revo on a redirect most of the time and off my harness when I couldn't/shouldn't use redirect~ but if you wanted to use it in guide mode what about redirecting the brake strand above the masterpoint.

While a consumer is free to do anything they want with whatever they purchase.  Belaying how ever you want to with whatever you want to is something that should be discouraged.  Which is exactly what Squeak was saying.  ,Mar 2015,Aug 21 2017,0

4206,Roofnest Roof Top Tent review,1,4, I bought a Roofnest last month and used it in the Saline Valley last week on a solo trip.  It performed great.  I live in the LA area and called to order mine at 10:00am it was delivered at 2:00pm the same day~ they have a distribution place in LA apparently.  I took it on some pretty rough roads~ long washboard and some steeper 4x4 trails to get to some potential new climbing spots and I never felt it bumping around though I did hear some creaking but that was the Thule rack and gutter connection and not the tent.   I don't care if people knock off the other brands~ it's done in all fields including climbing.   On the second night of my trip a dry cold system moved in and the wind really cranked up over night.   I have a Kestrel wind gauge and it was registering gusts up to 60mph with steady winds of 25-30mph and the tent held up great~ My only complaint is that Roofnest switched from a ratchet strap type closure to a metal buckle closure system.   I think the metal buckle closure has the potential to open if the two piece shell gets compressed while traveling on rough roads.  This never happened to me however even on the roughest roads though I would still prefer a ratchet stream or cam strap closure.,Apr 2012,Apr 19 2018,2
4207,Roofnest Roof Top Tent review,1,5, Great review and pics~ Kevin. Re. your concern about the buckle vs. ratchet closure. I have a Thule pod with questionable latches.

4209,Roofnest Roof Top Tent review,1,7, Time.  I have spent the last 40 years sleeping in a tent on the ground and will still do it from time to time but the main reason I bought this was time of set up.  That may not seem like a big deal but i got tired of rushing to pitch a tent during a rain storm or pulling into camp late at night and having to put up a tent.  The Roofnest literally goes up in less than a minute.  ,Apr 2012,Apr 19 2018,1
4210,Roofnest Roof Top Tent review,1,8, Kevin-thanks for sharing~ that's good info. I haven't been in that much wind with mine yet~ glad it did well. Nice looking rig you have there! I was tempted by the teardrop trailers as well~ lots of good options out there these days. Speaking of options~ if you leave the roofnest on the vehicle and finish the teardrop you'll have two really nice vehicle camping choices. Tapawingo - lots of reasons for me. easy setup and takedown is a big one. find a levelish spot to park and you can be set up super fast. you can even leave some bedding in the tent~ plus the foam mattress stays in place~ which can mean less stuff in the vehicle. Being up off the ground is nice; better views~ breezes~ less likely to have issues with wildlife. I've been awakened by a skunk in the wee hours of the morning in a ground tent~ heard this snuffing and scratching~ turn on the headlamp~ and see that the skunk is under the fly and i'm nose to nose with just the bug netting between us. Def would've slept better in a rooftop that night. :),Jul 2008,Apr 20 2018,0

I bought the Cragsmith 45L so I wouldn’t have to keep pulling my shit out of my backpacking pack every time I went backpacking. So far I’m impressed as a person who is always rough on his shit. The accessibility is my favorite part. I usually fit a 70M rope (flaked)~ my harness~ shoes~ quickdraws~ and a single trad rack in the main compartment. Between the two side pockets you can fit a 6 pack of cans. The top pocket can hold your other six beers and some snacks~ keys~ phone. Then there’s that little cigarette pocket on the waist belt that’s pretty rad. There seems to be a handle everywhere you need one with great stitching~ really feel confident they won’t be breaking any time soon. I feel like if I was going to take it and bivy I could easily tie on some stuff to the outside.

4234,Book Review: Vertical Mind,1,2," It sounds interesting.  I took two classes with Arno and found the most helpful the concept of ""breathe and move"" to silence those little voices.  Although a healthy dose of fear is needed especially in trad and ice climbing you don't want it to be parlyzing when you are unable to move even though within your physical ability to make the move. I found it helpful to expect to get ""the shakes"" and even embrace it. If it's something I expected my mind does not freak out and freeze my body.  I still place ""peace of mind pieces"" though :).

4240,Book Review: Vertical Mind,1,8, I'm just finishing the book and it is really good. I'm a scientist so I really appreciate the evidence driven approach they use. I like that the authors are experts in the field and are applying their scientific knowledge to climbing. They are also humorous in their writing and it is an easy read. The specific exercises are very useful and have generated lots of good discussion in my house about motivation~ why we climb~ etc... It has actually helped a lot to examine the sometimes differing motivations between me and my spouse which can occasionally lead to friction or a frustrating day out. I have tried to read Rock Warriors Way 2-3 times and just can't get through it~ though I recognize it has helped a lot of people.  Highly recommend the book!,Sep 2010,Sep 3 2014,1
4241,Book Review: Vertical Mind,1,9," Thanks Erika!  You mentioned a bunch of things we were aiming for...    - more scientific than other treatments of ""mental training""   - different motivations - ""fun"" doesn't begin to cover it   - concrete exercises   - humor / easy reading   I was really psyched (pun intended) about our project when Vertical Mind went to press~ but I never anticipated the amount or depth of the positive feedback we have received - from beginners to elite.

4243,Book Review: Vertical Mind,1,11, Great book. I especially appreciated the application of common-sense evolutionary psychology to explain the underpinnings of behaviors and attitudes that are maladaptive in the context of climbing. It's been quite helpful for me to see how basic social instincts are at the root of many of my failed scends. I also appreciated the gentle digs that Vertical Mind takes a climbing culture. Perhaps we will more readily restrain our douchiness if we understand how it hampers our performance. ,Jan 2015,Aug 28 2018,2

4246,Black Diamond Vapor Climbing Helmet Review,1,1, I have had a Vapor for nearly 4 years and it's has mostly held up well but a couple of weeks ago I noticed that the plastic shell had delaminated from the foam across most of the crown of the helmet.  I've retired it and just went to a new Scirroco but have only had one day in the new helmet.,Apr 2014,Aug 29 2018,0

4256,Mammut Trion Pro 35+7,7,1," What's the ""new version"" you're referring to? (Have they made changes~ and if so~ what year did the changes go into effect?) I have the Trion Pro 50+7~ purchased last spring. I use it for cragging; it's more geared toward alpine use~ with ice tool holders~ etc.~ but I like it a lot for hauling a load of trad/photography gear. (I haven't cracked into multipitch yet~ so have only used it for single-pitch cragging.) I particularly like the fact that it loads like a traditional top-loader~ but has the large U-shaped zipper to open the back panel for easy access. It's the back panel (between the shoulder straps) that opens this way~ so you don't have to set padded suspension system in the dirt to access the contents. It's hydration-compatible~ but only fits a 2-liter bladder. I'd prefer a 3-liter capacity~ as I've gone through a full 3 liters of water on some hot~ long climbing days. The suspension system is decent. It's not super-plush like some of the heavier packs~ but I've found it adequate for my needs. I haven't experienced any issues with load balancing or discomfort~ though I haven't done any super-heinous approaches with it.",Jul 2016,Aug 15 2018,0

4258,Best van for the climbing life,1,0, Hi all~ I'm hoping to harness the collective wisdom of the MP community to help us purchase a van for our outdoor pursuits. Our previous adventuremobile was recently retired by an out of control motorist (presumably Texan) on a snowy Colorado highway. We've got a check coming from the insurance company to help us get started with the #VanLife   To give you an idea of what we're looking for - basically a mid-range work van that we can work on ourselves to build out. I'd like to keep the initial price to $10k (van-only~ not fully built out) or less so a Sprinter resort-on-wheels is out of the question. We are two small-ish adults without pets or other smaller humans to worry about. We live in Colorado so performance in variable weather is a consideration. Eventually we would probably pop the top for additional sleeping space.   I'd love your thoughts on vehicle models~ reliability~ fuel types~ AWD vs RWD~ etc...   If there's already a topic covering this stuff buried in the history of the forum just tell me to bug off and do some searching.   Thanks all!,Nov 2011,Mar 28 2016,0
4259,Best van for the climbing life,1,1, I'm also in Colorado~ and I've got a Chevy Express 2500 AWD. The AWD is awesome~ it's honestly the best car I've driven in the snow~ period. I'm often passing stuck AWD/4WD SUVs when the roads get *really* bad. So~ the AWD is clutch I'd say.   Mine is a 5.3L V8~ which I think is the largest engine on this model. I also have a cargo box on top~ and even with the large engine and extra drag I still get up to about 16mpg highway (and I'm also not exactly delicate with the gas pedal).    I love my van~ highly recommended!

4262,Best van for the climbing life,1,4, Im not yet an owner of a van~ but I'm in the process of searching for the right deal. so my opinion may not be as valid. But i am leaning towards the ford e-150 for the reason being that I'm young and broke. the gas mileage of chevy vans in awd~ and even their rwd vans have shit gas mileage compared to the ford models. Also i trust ford a lot more. I'm not an expert on cars~ but i see a lot more ford vans getting sold with 300k mileage than i do chevy vans~ and this tells me something about their reliability and longevity. and just the fact that you see more ford vans on the road. I don't know shit about cars so these are just my observations from the research I've done.,Feb 2014,Mar 31 2016,0

4266,Best van for the climbing life,1,8, Working construction~ I've owned and been around most of the vans in the business. The Ford has the best reliability with the chevy a close second. They're not Toyota reliability but pretty close if well maintained. A couple friends have the chevy van with AWD and the 5.3 and are very happy with them. Pricier and kind of hard to find though. Mileage differences between the ford and Chevy are minimal~ expect mid teens in normal driving.    Can't find the link~ but a shipping company recently did a study regarding reliability. The ford van average maintainence costs were $.03/mile. Chevy~ $.04/mile. Sprinter~ $.10/mile    Dunno much about Westys/VW vans. They seem really cool~ really pricey~ and really prone to breaking down.,Apr 2008,Mar 31 2016,1

4268,Best van for the climbing life,1,10, Conversion vans... not as stealth but less desirable.   Mine was $3k. 2000 E-150. I spent another $500 fitting it out with storage and full size bed off amazon. Turned TV area into additional storage. Built a desk for the law school GF. Cosmically damaged but has 130k on it and runs great. Wouldn't be great in snow but its not a truck so with snow tires it might not be too squirly.   Best part. All the blinds work.

4275,Best van for the climbing life,1,17, 100% not a Westy unless you're ready to trade your climbing hobby in for a working on your Westy hobby. I have an e150 conversion and I love it. Crazy reliable~ does pretty damn decent on snowy and rocky roads(clearance isn't super~ 4wd might be better) but all the lights~ blinds~ insulation~ trim and cupholders inside made it an unbelievably easy conversion. And i got it CHEAP. Did I mention I get 24mpg? Because i get 24mpg.,Apr 2016,Jan 25 2018,2
4276,Best van for the climbing life,1,18, I got an old fedex sprinter for 10k and convert it to a camper. It is pretty cool but there are some issues with the van  that people don’t really speak about before buying one. They fixed some of the issues in the newer ones.  Engine wire harness is horrible the wires disintegrate over time because they are exposed above the engine. 2k to fix .Also~ it doesn’t do well in high winds~ you get  light that will eventually go away. No fix. The other fun one~ the van randomly decides not to read the key chip and you get a ”no start” . It is the antenna around the ingition lock and some hardware above the instrument cluster. Sometimes you can fix it by resetting the ECU but not always~ people got stuck in the middle of nowhere,unknown,Jan 25 2018,1

Given its climbing focused features~ this pack makes for a great multi-day alpine climbing bag or large bag for big loads at the crag. It's simple design makes it easy to use~ comfortable to carry~ and versatile for almost every discipline of climbing. The only real downside is the inability to adjust the frame size~ limiting it to only people that are able to fit the default.,Jan 2014,Aug 4 2018,0
4280,Arc'teryx Alpha IS - The Quiver of One Jacket,1,0," Just happen to come across this very good review of the flagship climbing jacket from Arc'teryx~ from a well respected and climber/reviewer in Canada.Arc'teryx Alpha IS Based on his review~ seems like this jacket is truly a ""Quiver of One"" jacket~ and it'd better be~ given it's high price tag~ as he mentions a few times throughout his review: ""The Alpha IS is equally adept as a belay parka~ an approach piece or a climbing layer. It really is all that and then some~ and the more I wear it the more useful it turns out to be. "" ""The versatility is rather baffling."" ""It truly is a climbing shell and belay jacket and a half-dozen other layers all combined into one. Highly recommended~ but it does cost over a thousand dollars~ and I still haven’t quite made my peace with that. "" As tempting an all-in-one piece this jacket is reviewed to be~ and despite some past season sales online~ the cost is too much for my pocket and I'm happy with my cheaper Patagonia and TNF layering system for climbing~ but some of you may find this review useful for your climbing needs or looking to replace your old and tattered multi-layering system.",Mar 2017,Jul 28 2018,0

4282,Mad Rock Flash 2018??,8,0, Wondering if anyone has tried the Mad Rock Flash 2018? Just looking for a shoe with decent performance that I can use when my feet need a break. I hear they are comfortable... how do they perform? Durability? Any thoughts on sizing? Or does anyone have thoughts on Mad Rock shoes in general? I haven't tried them before. Hesitant to order when I can only get store credit if they don't work out. How are their models overall? Any recommendations? ,Jul 2018,Jul 12 2018,0
4283,Mad Rock Flash 2018??,8,1, I had a pair of Mad Rock Flash 2.0s (predecessors to the 2018s) as my pair of beginner shoes (basically Mad Rock's version of Evolv Defy or Sportiva Tarantula) and I was quite pleased with them for what they were. Nobody is really going to send La Dura Dura in shoes at that price point~ so keep your expectations tempered. But the 2.0s were very~ very comfortable and I thought impressively sensitive. Can't really edge at all~ though. Durability was adequate~ they lasted me about a year until I wore holes in the toes. But they were my first pair so I was probably thrashing them more than I otherwise would have. I would probably size true to US size or *maybe* a half size down; the leather upper stretched a pretty sizeable amount. Overall I would let price be your guide between these~ Defys~ and Tarantula(ce)s.

4286,Mad Rock Flash 2018??,8,4, I know this thread is a little dead~ but I'm bored so here's my two cents: Sizing: go with street shoe size. I tried to downsize with a pair of drifters once~ and it was a mistake (Note: Mad Rock flashes are stiffer~ sexier drifters) -I have the mad rock flash 2018~ and it is indeed very comfy. Seems super durable; I've only had it for three months~ but its my gym shoe~ so its been taking a beating. Feels like it'll last another year at least. -Unfortunately~ I think its so durable because the rubber sucks (read: hard rubber). On the plus side~ kicking the wall doesn't hurt as much in these. -The heel is much improved on from the dumb padded nonsense they tried out in the mad rock flash 2.0. However~ it still isn't great. -The front part of the shoe is great. Fits almost exactly like the anasazi line from 5.10. -This is a stiffer shoe than the drifter~ and more comfy on tiny holds because of it.  -I've taken the flash 2018 out on my local short limestone sport crag~ and it performed pretty well (although I didn't try anything above 10d). Summary(ies):  Despite it's short comings~ I doubt there exists a better shoe with a list price of $90. Totally worth the cash if that's your budget. Mad Rock Flash 2018: a solid climbing shoe built with durability in mind. Mad Rock Drifter: a velcro-adjustable sock with rubber on it. P.S. I love the drifter and it should never change.,Apr 2017,Jul 23 2018,0
4287,Alien Fixe cam,1,0, With the Alien Fixe cam being on sale for 60$ right now~ are they worth the money?  Has anyone tried them and can vouch for fixing the old problems they had?  What are your thoughts?,Oct 2017,May 11 2018,0

4290,Alien Fixe cam,1,3, My new black Alien arrived yesterday. I had some reservations but the workmanship appears solid. The issues I had heard of were with the trigger wires and trigger~ and both were resolved in the redesign. It's not the most polished bit of gear (compared to metolius MCs~ for example)~ but doesn't feel cheap  either. Hopefully I'll get a chance to try it out soon.,Jun 2016,May 11 2018,1
4291,Alien Fixe cam,1,4, Anyone have one blow apart recently or had to deal with customer service?  I need to find a replacement for my blue and black CCH Aliens and the Totem Basics are out of stock/prohibitively expensive right now~ but I'm worried about the reliability/craftsmanship considering their track record...,Jun 2012,May 22 2018,1

4293,Alien Fixe cam,1,6, Sorry in advance for all these questions... Do you know which design it was--Oringal~ Evo~ or Revo?   Do you know what failed and how?  Did he report this failure to Fixe and what came about from it?,Jun 2012,May 22 2018,0
4294,Alien Fixe cam,1,7, Can't remember the design~ But pretty sure an original. Bomber placement~ but a bit irregular. Torqued one lobe back beyond max and slightly bent the axle. Probably still good as an aid piece~ but he doesn't aid.,Mar 2016,May 22 2018,0
4295,Alien Fixe cam,1,8, I love the Revos~ though I did destroy one when I fell after placing it in a pod that had a constricting outside lip~ allowing it to umbrella. It was my first and only piece~ and I decked but walked away. Maybe a .3 or .4 Camalot would have held passively~ though they're so wide I don't think one would have gone in that particular spot.https://www.instagram.com/p/BbALBWOl3_o/,Oct 2007,May 22 2018,1
4296,Alien Fixe cam,1,9, I have the red and yellow original fixe aliens. I've fallen on both (nothing massive) with no problems. Still~ interesting to hear about the potential failure mentioned by John. Although by his comment it sounds like the cam might have caught the fall but was then ruined for future use. Certainly not ideal~ but also not as bad as previous failures with exploding heads~ etc. Also a 15 footer onto the black alien is not insignificant especially if it was low on the pitch. By way of comparison~ I have the Kailas Nucos in red~ yellow~ and green and they feel nearly identical to the original fixe aliens (as they should). I have fallen on those as well with no problems.,Jul 2013,May 22 2018,0
4297,Alien Fixe cam,1,10, I would sort of expect a black alien to get wrecked in a good sized fall~ depending how much rope was out. It's only a 5kn piece.,Jun 2016,May 22 2018,7

I cannot find anything but a Small to try on. I've read a bunch of reviews that say to size up~ but only one from a lady (read: hips and thighs) who was shorter and a bit lighter than I am. My friend's small is definitely too small~ so I'm torn between a M and a L.  I'm 5'5"" and 140. I'd like to use it for everything~ from sport to multi-pitch trad to ice.

4310,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,0, This isn't really a review~ but I just wanna say the leather TX2 is a badass shoe. I bought them to replace worn out Scarpa Iguanas. The TX2 is more supportive~ hikes better~ and climbs better than the Iguana. The TX2's leather should be much more durable than the Iguana or mesh TX2 and take a strap on crampon for snow approaches much better. My Iguanas in size 45 weigh an average of 360g each while the leather TX2s in 45.5 weigh 350g each. Only potential downside is breathability or being too hot~ but I guess that can be an upside depending on the type of approaches you're doing,Oct 2007,Jun 14 2018,0
4311,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,1, Have you tried the TX3? And can make a comparison? ,Apr 2010,Jun 14 2018,2
4312,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,2, When they were first released~ I got a pair of the TX2s and the TX3s to do a direct comparison. The TX3s have much more volume in the toe box and are more supportive and cushiony all around. I would think the TX4 would be more appropriate than the TX3 if you might encounter snow. The leather TX2 is maybe better compared to the TX4.,Oct 2007,Jun 14 2018,0
4313,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,3," Agree With Brian.  The TX series is BY far my favorite series of approach shoes.  FINALLY a replacement for Exum Ridges from BITD.  The TX3 (fabric) and TX4 (Leather) are nearly identical save the outer material.  I prefer~ slightly~ the TX4 because of lower key looks which allow them to be worn in town or more ""socially"".  The leather also makes them a bit more durable.  Both have a great~ roomy toe box and Brian noted in his historic review long ago.  The TX2 series is a different beast with a much lower toe box.  The TX2 is really a true carry-it-with-you shoe being lighter and more nimble but not as supportive or~ IMO~ comfortable since the toe box is thin.  I too have the TX2s and find they have the same plus/minus as the TX3/4.  Only thing I've noted in my pair of Leather TX2s is the toe area seems slightly more constrictive but that could be a matter of needing more break in time.",Jun 2006,Jun 14 2018,3
4314,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,4, TX2s climb really well and running in them is ok. They are not very durable though. Scrambling in the flatirons with only 75sh miles on mine and they have worn holes through the toes on the rand.  Maybe I have shit footwork~ but none of my other approach shoes have ever worn holes through the toes from scrambling. ,Mar 2014,Jun 15 2018,1

4317,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,7, Talking about approach shoes ive been scoping the tx line for a month or so now but they never have the tx2 in my size. I want something I can climb better in and the toes on the tx3 seemed a bit bulky. Tx2 does not look or feel durable but sacrifices that for what look like lightweight and better climb performance with the narrow toe box. However can someone comment on the salomon spry approach shoes?

4319,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,9," I have the mesh TX3's and TX2's~ plus the leather TX2's. I love them all~ and I agree with most everything on this thread people have been posting.  The leather TX2's seem just a bit hotter on the feet than the mesh~ and I seem to prefer the mesh because of it. The TX2 is def. the low volume~ lightweight offering~ so I wouldn't suggest them for long days of hiking~ unless you're really good at keeping things nice (I'm not~ but my buddy Peter is - maybe it's how much I weigh compared to him?)  For Flatiron scrambling~ I usually use them only while actually scrambling - I use trailrunners for the trail in an attempt to extend the life of them. I haven't busted the little toe area of any of my TX's. (I also like to tag a summit when I'm out there scrambling~ too). I don't think many of my scrambling buddies do the same - they just wear the TX's and say~ ""job done"".  I'm getting ready to resole my TX3's~ as I've had them the longest.  When I drop them off~ I'm going to pick up some barge cement to do some maintenene on the outsole of my mesh TX2's~ there's a little bit of separation I'd like to nip in the bud.",Jan 2014,Jun 16 2018,1

4321,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,11, To people who have tried both the TX2 and TX3... if I was looking to do a summer ascent of the Grand Teton via the Upper Exum~ which shoe would you prefer?

4322,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,12," IMO that would be defeating the purpose of the shoe.  TX2s are true ""approach"" shoes~ in that they are super light and pack down small~ so they are perfect for throwing in a pack or clipping to your harness for when you switch into rock shoes.  It doesn't surprise me that they take a hit in durability (mine have held up fine but I haven't logged nearly as many miles as you guys)~ but that's probably what was sacrificed in the interest of weight savings.  Also~ the low-volume toe felt uncomfortable at first (I could feel my toes poking the top of the shoe)~ but after breaking in they are super comfortable.",Jul 2014,Jul 3 2018,1
4323,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,13, I can do pretty long Teton-esque days in my TX2s without issue. I think TX3s would be nicer for heavy trail though. Fit is pretty personal - a Teton sort of day would destroy my knees wearing the popular 5.10 Guide Tennies. Actually~ I recall doing the Teton in circa 2011 with Salewa Firetails and my knees were indeed pretty shot.,Jan 2011,Jul 3 2018,1
4324,Sportiva TX2 Leather,1,14, the tx4's would be perfect for this.  i have used mine on quite a few long day sorts of things and they are great.  for the grand~ the descent and hike out really wear on you if you do it in a day.  if you have old feet~ the TX4's will provide better support for this.  i also like the leather over the mesh as the mesh tends to let in too much dirt/sand/debris.,Dec 2004,Jul 3 2018,3

I think it dethrones the Guide Tennie as the best overall/ beefier approach shoe. Midsole/ Stiffness TX2 = softer side of an approach shoes~ doesn't edge that well but ok. Smearing is bomber. No way in hell I'd put a strap on crampon on it. TX3/4 = stiffer/ perfect end of approach shoes but for sure not a Boulder X~ 1st gen Adidas Approach~ or Scarpa Crux. A touch stiffer than an old guide tennie. Climbs way better for this~ I've felt comfortable climbing 5.9 in them (not ""test piece"" yosemite 5.9...)

4336,belaySAFE,1,1, I think the biggest thing would be flexibility in how you set up top ropes for different uses. Alot of times with the bar wrap~ little kids can't be lowered easily. I saw these at CWA and they're interesting~ but they're also not fast to adjust- which makes them not that appealing for me.

4342,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,1,0, Well~ my 1st impressions are in on the Revo. Put it through its paces last night and was thoroughly impressed. It handles like an ATC and is very intuitive to use. No special training required~ no hand positions to worry about. If you can operate an ATC~ you can use this. We initially ran laps on TR and it handled that task with ease. Taking in slack~ holding a climber and lowering were all spot on. This was actually the smoothest lowering device I've ever used. The GriGri tends to be a little herky jerky at times as you feather the cam. The internal wheel makes lowering smooth as silk. If you get carried away and start lowering too fast the device will lock. Unlocking couldn't be easier with a quick tug of the brake strand and you can resume lowering. After TR~ we tried it out on lead and this is hands down the smoothest device for paying out slack to lead climber I have ever used. It's virtually impossible to short rope somebody as we often do with other devices~ particularly the GriGri when its cam engages. Again~ the wheel is what allows such fluid movement. We also took many test falls on lead to see how the lock engaged. If you are very attentive~ the lock may not engage because you arrest fall before the wheel begins to spin fast enough to lock. If you have a little slack in brake strand~ the device locks up quickly and with a loud~ satisfying click.  Again~ disengaging lock is as easy as a quick tug on brake strand. For those interested~ the manual states the centrifugal lock engages at >4m/s. That's hard to achieve when feeding rope but happens almost immediately in a fall. The only downside I could see is the inability to engage lock when rope is already loaded. So imagine a climber calls take and wants to hangdog for a bit. You would have to hold him like you do with an ATC instead of letting device take the load like you can with a GriGri.  Unfortunately all the amazing features of the device are overshadowed by this defect that prevented the device from locking closed. A piece of metal was broken that prevented the latch from securing the device closed. It didn't affect operation as the carabiner holds it closed when in use~ but this is obviously a defect and hopefully not a sign of durability issues. It certainly is more complex than other devices which can leave you with more points of failure. I've contacted WildCountry to report the issue and will update this thread when I hear back from them. ,Nov 2015,Dec 7 2017,5

4344,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,1,2, Michael- I have had a similar problem with mine. although I only noticed it when taking weight or catching a fall and the forces of the 2 rope strands pry the device a little apart~ it is enough to disengage the locking mechanism. not sure if mine will open as easily as yours without even touching the locking clasp. the locking carabiner keeps the device from swiveling open though. curious what WC has to say. ,Apr 2015,Dec 7 2017,1

4346,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,1,4, So~ one day of climbing no serious whips and its broke already or shipped broken.  Can't say if it shipped broken~ but it definitely went from sticky (took some force to open it without lever) to completely loose within 1 climbing session.  I definitely used lever to open it when I was playing around with it but since I wasn't familiar with the device I cannot say for sure what state it was in when I received it.  The box was pretty mangled~ but as the broken piece is internal~ I doubt that has anything to do with it.  And here's a pic.  I believe that rounded piece should extend down to where the shiny metal is which would provide a solid surface for the latch to catch when locked. ,Nov 2015,Dec 7 2017,0

That looks (from the blurry photo) of either a manufacturing defect (internal material flaw/micro crack) or a problem in tolerance stackup. I'm a little surprised looking at where the coating stops that the locking device isn't a little more positive in design which makes me suspect that its an issue of tolerance stackup.

To be totally upfront  the rest of this is spitballing a bit... The surface on the failed surface doesn't seem to have a lot of deformation and has a clean(ish) fracture surface. That would suggest that it failed fairly quickly and on a single loading. Looking at the shape of the failure~ and guessing at load paths~ I would bet there was a crack in the latch catch that failed~ most likely the first time any load was applied to it. The surface looks like it was almost certainly shot peened (see the surface texture) which isn't super surprising as a stress relief. I would bet there was an undetected (or unchecked) crack during forging. Without having handled one~ I'm surprised that there was enough force applied through the latching mechanism to actually do this damage unless that crack was fairly large or there was a fairly large underlying material flaw. It would seem like you would design that mechanism to take almost no force once a carabiner is placed through the ears at the bottom....and if it did apply force~ spread it out over a larger area. You didn't drop it (sincere question not accusing) with it latched did you?,Jul 2015,Dec 7 2017,0
4356,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,1,14," You actually can get the device to lock for a take~ but you can't do it with tension on the brake strand. Tensioning the brake strand is actually how you unlock the device~ so keeping it tight will prevent it from locking. (Is this way~ the technique is significantly different from a Grigri.) I was able to pull in slack (pulling up with my brake hand)~ and use my other hand to lift the ""shoulder"" and lock the device. Then~ I'd return my brake hand to the ""brake"" position~ but without putting downward tension on the brake strand. (So while my hand was in the brake position~ there was actuall some slack between mu hand and the device.) This allowed the device to lock completely~ and my brake hand wasn't holding any of the climber's weight.",Jul 2016,Dec 7 2017,5

Pretty solid customer service if you ask me.,Nov 2015,Dec 7 2017,4
4359,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,1,17, It sounds like there might be a couple other users that have experienced the same breakage based on the comments in the related thread~ i.e. when the rope gets cross loaded in the device (so rope not going tuber to tuber) which  can be pretty common when catching a fall/ even the weight of taking a climber~ the clasp that initially closes the device comes undone and the device swivels open a bit. granted there is a locking carabiner holding the 2 halves of the unit together and prevents the device from opening. If the carabiner were not there~ the device would swivel open entirely. when climbing is resumed the device can be clicked closed again. not sure if this will happen when the forces are not side to side on the device. but the play and the opening/closing of the device kind of concerned me,Nov 2017,Dec 7 2017,0

4364,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,1," OK~ quick and dirty writeup of my not-very-extensive experiences with the Revo so far.    First off: I do not rope solo~ nor do I care about rope soloing.  I spent a bit of time playing around with it on a spare rope on a climbing wall~ and I have used it for 2 sessions in the gym~ both top-roping and lead climbing.  My climbing partners took a few top-rope falls~ and hangdogged a bit~ but no one took any lead falls.  And we conducted a test of sorts where I let go of the brake strand (with a friend backing me up by holding the brake strand about 1 metre lower down from my hands) while my climber is hanging.  Said climber was prepared to fall for almost 2 metres but the locking assist function of the Revo arrested the fall after about a foot of freefall.  The device locks up when either strand is pulled at a speed that spins the wheel at 4m/s or greater.  So in theory~ when lead belaying~ the device can lock up on you if you whip out slack super quickly.  Whether or not that actually ever happens to you when lead belay is largely dependent on your belaying style and other situational factors.  Likewise~ in theory~ when top-rope belaying~ the device can lock up if you VERY QUICKLY take in slack~ this is probably easier to do if you ever employ the technique of jumping up while simultaneously taking in slack.  If you're climbing with fat or fuzzy gym ropes then you will probably need to choose your belay biner wisely.  Too fat of a belay biner and the belay biner pushes up against the rope~ resulting in the device locking up frequently while top rope belaying.  I reckon most locking biners are probably not a problem in this regard.  I can speak from experience: AVOID the Omega Pacific Tephra.  The Simond Spider HMS BLC works great~ and I'm sure many other belay biners do as well.  TOP ROPE BELAYING: It functions very much like an ATC-XP BUT with LESS friction (especially when lowering) due to the rope doing a 180 degree turn wrapping around a spinning wheel instead of going through 2 sharp 180 degree bends. It feels like it has slightly less friction than the Omega Pacific SBG II (in the lowest friction setup - pictured here) when lowering~ but roughly comparable to the Omega Pacific SBG II's second-lowest friction setup (pictured here) when holding a hangdogging climber WITHOUT the locking assist engaged. As previously mentioned~ the action of locking off the rope to hold a climber will prevent the locking assist from engaging~ or staying engaged.   Also previously mentioned was a way around it: if your climber calls for a take proceed to take up all the slack~ but do not lock off yet!  Immediately use your other hand~ your non-brake hand to push up both jaws.  Your thumb pushes up the jaws closer to you and your index finger pushes up the jaws farther away from you.  And then you may bring your brake hand down BUT you must maintain some slack in the length of the brake strand between the device and your hand to ensure that you don't pull the rope down over the engaged jaws~ thereby disengaging them and releasing the locking assist. Activating the locking assist while holding the weight of a climber does not appear to be possible. While lowering there is a kind of ""rattling"" sound coming from inside the device.  The sounds make me think that the device is trying to lock up but the force of the brake strand holding down the farther jaws prevents it from happening.   LEAD BELAYING: Ever since i started lead climbing (gym and single-pitch sport climbing) I have been searching for my Holy Grail of lead belay devices: a belay device that functions just like a tube~ but has a locking assist function that activates when the climber falls and/or hangdogs.  I hate how the Grigri [2]~ Sum~ Smart~ Click-Up~ Eddy~ Jul 2~ Matic~ ATC Pilot~ Cinch~ Vergo~ etc. require you to do something with the device (hold down lever~ pull up on the loop/hook) in order to temporarily override the locking assist while you are quickly paying out slack~ or~ have your brake hand holding the brake strand in the not-so-locked-off position (Click-Up) to reduce the odds of it locking up while you are quickly paying out slack. I was hopeful the the Revo would be it. It's not quite it~ but it appears to be at least 90% of the way there~ far closer than any other belay device. When it comes to paying out slack it is a dream come true.  Paying out slack is smooth and hassle-free.  No need to touch the device~ let alone have to perform any additional actions beyond what you would do with a tube-style belay device.  Even when I was quickly whipping out slack for those high clips~ or fast desperate clips~ the device did not lock up. None of my climbing partners took any lead falls.    Really~ the only thing the prevents this device from being 100% the Holy Grail of lead belay devices that I've been searching for for so long is that the only ways for the locking assist to activate are via the wheel spinning at 4m/s or faster~ and by manually pushing up the two jaws with your hand.  So maybe not the best for belaying a hangdogger until you get used to the technique I described earlier.  The Revo is now my new go-to belay device for lead belaying in the gym and single-pitch sport. The ATC Pilot and/or Jul 2 remain for now my go to belay device(s) for belaying a hangdogger.  This might change to the Revo once I burn into my muscle memory the technique for manually activating the locking assist. The Omega Pacific SBG II will probably always be my go to belay device for belaying a non-hangdogging top-roper~ or someone who is extremely to fall    ",Oct 2009,Dec 12 2017,4
4365,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,2,"  While lowering there is a kind of ""rattling"" sound coming from inside the device.  The sounds make me think that the device is trying to lock up but the force of the brake strand holding down the farther jaws prevents it from happening. The Revo's lock cannot be overridden or disabled nor can it be loaded backwards which is why it is considered one of the safest if not the safest belay device on the market.  Even if you are holding down the jaws~ preventing them from popping up~ the lock will still engage.  I have personally tested this in 2 ways.  First~ by lowering a climber fast enough to activate lock even though brake strand is holding down jaw and 2nd by holding down both jaws with my hand and doing a test pull with a rope.  By design the device will lock if the wheel spins faster than 4m/s no matter what the belayer does.   And I absolutely agree with your assessment~ I love this device but I wish there was an easier way to manually engage the lock while holding the weight of a climber.  The trickery required to manually lock them off will take some serious practice before I become comfortable doing it outside of a test environment.   ",Nov 2015,Dec 12 2017,1
4366,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,3, Michael- I have had a similar problem with mine. although I only noticed it when taking weight or catching a fall and the forces of the 2 rope strands pry the device a little apart~ it is enough to disengage the locking mechanism. not sure if mine will open as easily as yours without even touching the locking clasp. the locking carabiner keeps the device from swiveling open though. curious what WC has to say.  I found using a locker with fat bar stock prevents the device from rotating open.  I was using a thinner locker and noticed the locking lever on the Revo open up~ this is a non issue as the device still works just fine but in the future I'll be using a cheap fat BD locker I have that prevents any opening or rotation.,Apr 2012,Dec 14 2017,2
4367,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,4, Kevin- thanks for the suggestion~ I posted in another of the existing threads about the revo as i'm sure you're following and will see. ,Apr 2015,Dec 14 2017,1
4368,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,5, I used the Revo all day yesterday on single pitch~ multi pitch and top rope and it worked just like it was supposed to.  The complaint some have had about the locking mechanism lever opening slightly is most likely due to using skinny locking biners.  Using a thicker bar stock biner eliminates that issue all together.   The locking mechanism IMO is not needed as the locking biner holds the device shut  in the same way the Grigri does.  The locking mechanism if you look at it is not meant to hold a lot of weight~ the biner takes the weight.  I would not be surprised to see the locking mechanism gone in future variations of the Revo.,Apr 2012,Dec 16 2017,0
4369,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,6, ... it is considered one of the safest if not the safest belay device on the market.... Who do you represent? IMHO until we've had a significant number of users and a few accidents we don't really know how safe it is.,Apr 2015,Dec 16 2017,2
4370,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,7, On Wed~ I climbed with in trio who had one. All three of us belayed with it for the first few rounds. Only the guy who owns it was willing to take test falls from the anchors~ and it caught him just fine. It feeds like a dream~ but lowering is not buttery smooth. It probably should be noted that after a few rounds~ all three of us went back to the devices we preferred before: I use a megajul~ another guy uses a grigri2~ and the revo's owner used an ATC XP toothed tuber in high friction mode to belay my lard ass when on lead because the revo locked pretty consistently when lowering me. As the leader being lowered~ I found it to be pretty jerky and halting~ but we concluded it's likely because I'm so much heavier than the other two since they had smooth rides down.,May 2016,Dec 16 2017,1

4377,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,14, Fine~ pick different words. I'm just reporting my experience with one. You described your experience being lowered with the Revo~ and you attributed the reason for the jerky and halting lower to the device.    I'm trying to figure out how that can be the case.  I only know of one way to lower with the Revo~ and that is the exact same way as lowering with a tube.  In said lowering method the brake strand pushes down on the jaws~ thereby preventing it from locking up.  So I am VERY CURIOUS to hear of your experience~ especially if it is actually due to the device~ and not due to the belayer's less-than-proficient use of the device~ resulting in a jerky and halting lower.  I can see maybe if the belayer is lowering a heavy climber~ then they may not be used to a device that has less friction when lowering~ hence resulting in a jerky and halting lower.  However~ if your belayer was actually able to get the device to lock up while lowering~ then I~ and other users of the Revo~ really want to know how he/she did it!  Like we have pointed out~ it does not appear to be possible to get the device to lock up while the climber's weight is on it. ,Oct 2009,Dec 18 2017,0

One of the main features of the Revo is it is (supposedly) impossible to override the autolock mechanism. If the rope is running through the device at more than 4m/s it will lock even if the jaws are being held down.  To unlock it in this case you have to lift up the brake side to let the jaw pop up then pull it back down.  If it was jerky and locking up it means the belayer was lowering too fast for the device and just needs to adjust their technique for a slower lower.,Apr 2013,Dec 18 2017,3
4379,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,16,  How the heck does the Revo lock up if the belayer is holding the brake strand DOWN over the jaws of the device??????????????????????????????

4380,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,17, If the device locks up while you are being lowered~ your belayer is lowering you too fast. PERIOD.  Lowering on the Revo was incredibly smooth and was easy to keep it under control~ even when lowering a 200lb climber.  However~ if it does start picking up speed the device will lock~ preventing climber from decking at an unsafe speed.  I know a lot of belayers that lower at unsafe speeds on an ATC and try to slow you down just before you hit the ground.  This isn't a game I like to play and am glad it locks up if the belayer lowers you too fast.  ,Nov 2015,Dec 18 2017,2

Ah~ yes~ I forgot about that feature even though I watched it being demonstrated in the Wild Country video on the Revo. So~ if that is the case~ then Tradgic Yogurt's belayer was lowering him at a rate of 4m/s or faster~ which meant that he would have dropped 1 metre in 0.25 seconds~ or half a metre in 0.125 seconds.  I don't think that is a speed that one should make a habit out of when lowering.  So there are 2 possible explanations for the jerky and halting lower: 1) Belayer was not used to the lower friction lower and was abruptly increasing and decreasing their grip on the brake strand. 2) Belayer was lowering too quickly.  EDIT:  3) The rope was a stiff and/or thick rope ,Oct 2009,Dec 18 2017,0
4382,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,2,19, I 100% agree if it locked while lowering someone was lowering way to fast~ and it must have been hands free.  I used it for a few hours and TRIED to get it to lock on a top rope lower and was unable.  That is the part that scared me.  I kept an incredibly loose grip on rope and the climber fell way faster than I am comfortable with and I still couldn't get it to lock.  Now in defense of the REVO it was double looped at the top of the anchor so there may have been enough friction to not allow it to catch.  To me after that lower I seriously think you would have to go hands free to get it to lock on a lower. I'm sticking with my grigri after using it~ it fed like a dream but the size~ inability to easily lock up will cause me to stick with the tried and true grigri.    Thanks,Jul 2017,Dec 18 2017,0

PERIOD.  Lowering on the Revo was incredibly smooth and was easy to keep it under control~ even when lowering a 200lb climber. You're mostly right. As I reported in the other thread~ though~ when lowering with thick/stiff ropes the friction of the rope will pull the jaw up on the ""opposite"" side of locking~ leaving it in a weird half locked position. When this happen~ it doesn't fully lock~ but every revolution of the wheel there's a loud tick and a jolt from the device. It isn't speed related~ I was able to watch this happening while lowering somebody extremely slowly.

Every single time I tried to allow the climber to accelerate when lowering~ it got to an uncomfortable lowering speed and I clamped down to arrest the climber; the device never locked. However~ if you completely open your hands on the brake strand~ the device locks instantly (we did this with a belay backup). In other words~ you have to completely release the tension from the brake strand. I mentioned this in my first impressions in the other Revo thread. In this case~ the climber doesn't drop far at all (only a foot or less)~ and certainly doesn't accelerate to 4 m/s. Rather~ it appears that the friction of the rope in the v-grooves is enough to flip up the jaw when you release it quickly. As mentioned previously~ this is very counterintuitive~ and goes against proper belay technique. This may of course be rope-dependent~ but if the device is locking up while lowering~ it's likely due to incorrect technique.,Jul 2016,Dec 18 2017,0

4392,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,3,9, Can't say if it shipped broken~ but it definitely went from sticky (took some force to open it without lever) to completely loose within 1 climbing session.  I definitely used lever to open it when I was playing around with it but since I wasn't familiar with the device I cannot say for sure what state it was in when I received it.  The box was pretty mangled~ but as the broken piece is internal~ I doubt that has anything to do with it.  And here's a pic.  I believe that rounded piece should extend down to where the shiny metal is which would provide a solid surface for the latch to catch when locked.  I just took a close look at my revo~ and it looks just like this. Mine does not have a problem with opening during use~ but the little holder has the same weird chopped off look on the end of the curve.

I'm guessing there was a problem with a whole batch of these as they still haven't sent me out a new one.  Unfortunately it appears as that metal is prone to breaking as numerous people have reported similar occurrences~ albeit at different levels of severity.,Nov 2015,Dec 19 2017,0

4401,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,3,18, Maybe the Revo isn't the best all around belay device~ but I think Wild Country designed it primarily to be the safest device on the market.  Its too soon to judge whether or not it really is the safest device around~ and the way they screwed up the locking latch makes me wonder what else they screwed up.  But~ if a total beginner asked me what device to buy~ I think I would tell them to get this one.  It seems to me like it eliminates a lot of possibilities of user error. I'm curious what those of you who own the Revo perceive regarding its safety.  Would you feel comfortable handing one too a beginner (with a bit of instruction from you) and being belayed by him/her?,Mar 2015,Dec 20 2017,0

I would feel safer being belayed with the Revo than any other device I've seen or used.  Learning curve is probably the lowest~ payout is smooth~ and most importantly~ the locking mechanism cannot be overridden.  It eliminates the fear that they'll let go of brake strand if using an ATC as well as being lowered uncontrollably by any device.  I do not believe this is a replacement for a GriGri or can be directly compared to it.  In my mind this is really a tube style device with an auto locking backup. The GriGri will still have a place in my arsenal and will certainly use it when someone is working a route and I know they'll be hanging a lot.,Nov 2015,Dec 20 2017,6
4403,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,4,0, Like Michael~ if a beginner is going to belay me~ I'd want them to have this. As long as they keep the amount of slack rope to a reasonable level~ it seems pretty much guaranteed to stop you from decking. Frankly~ the Revo feels like a good first version of this system. Right now it's a usable (and extremely safe) belay device~ and hopefully in the next few years there will be new versions of it that fix the problems.,Jul 2012,Dec 20 2017,2
4404,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,4,1, Just spent another day trad climbing with it and like it more and more each day i use it.  There is no smother device~ feeds like butter.   Cant wait to do some aid soloing with it.  ,Apr 2012,Dec 20 2017,2
4405,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,4,2, I spent a day (finally!) with this.  It is fantastic for lead and is almost too easy to use.  The little latch that I've heard so much about is far from a concern for me.  It definitely does not participate in the mechanics of the device. I found that lowering with the revo can be tough using the standard ATC brake rope slide style and can be rather jerky.  My partner decided to forego that method and just use a hand over hand approach which was far smoother and easier (weird).  I gave that method a try and I was definitely surprised to see that it worked so well.  When I was lowering with a standard ATC slide style I felt like there was not enough friction to lower the climber in a controlled way~ hence the jerkiness because I kept grabbing the rope to try to slow it down before the device locked. With the hand over hand method~ I felt like it was easier because it seemed like it took way less effort to control the lower and I felt more secure as I had a solid grasp on the rope at all times. To lock the Revo while a climber is hanging on the rope was also easier than I thought that it would be.  Once again~ my partner got it figured out.  While I hung above him and he was holding my entire weight~ he just grabbed the brake strand below where his brake hand was at (with his other hand) and let the rope slide through his brake hand while holding with the other hand below.  He didn't exert any holding effort on the lower hand~ just a tight grip to act like a backup knot.  The revo locked reliably within a fraction of a second once he started to allow the rope to slide and I really didn't move much at all.  He did raise his brake hand up to about level with the tuber (not below in a normal ATC locked off position). Edit: I should mention that I cleaned a route while being lowered and my belayer had *no* trouble at all locking the device at each stopping point while I unclipped draws.  I also did not notice that I was stopping below where I wanted to be.  This was my partner's first use of the device and he had no trouble with it all. I was also able to lift the tuber while my partner was hanging on the rope and lock the device with very little effort.  I did have to raise my brake hand up to about level with the device or just above in order to engage the lock on the tuber.  That method didn't seem (to me) as reliable or trivial though as my partner's method which he executed several times in a row just to show off... I feel like this device has the Gri Gri beat~ but I'm not a Gri Gri fanboy~ so maybe I'm not defending it adequately.,May 2015,Dec 20 2017,7

4427,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,4, We have now put the Revo through its paces on about 15 climbing days~ used by seven different belayers. I wanted to write up a little review that focuses on our target use: kids lead belaying. TL;DR: our kids fight for the Revo~ not only when belaying~ but also when being belayed. The partners with lowest priority get the Grigri 2. :) But the adults still prefer the Grigri 2 when belaying a leader working a route.  The major consideration here is that our kids simply cannot reliably pay out slack on the Grigri 2. With our 12-year-old~ we are talking months of practice on dozens and dozens of belays~ trying at least four different methods recommended by others~ including the official Petzl method. I think his hands are just too small. The Revo solves that problem. Pros:  Cons Any difficulties with friction because of weight differential can be offset by using an Edelrid Ohm. However~ we've decided the Ohm is more trouble than it is worth. Since we usually climb overhanging routes~ we were frequently encountering situations where the Ohm made it nearly impossible to feed slack reliably or to lower safely. Fortunately~ my son and I now have a reasonable weight differential and don't need it anymore. We will still pack the Ohm for situations when one of the younger kids needs to belay another~ larger kid leading a route that offers a workable ropeline for the Ohm.  Our kids literally fight over the Revo because it completely eliminates the frustrations they inevitably have with the Revo. They also prefer to be belayed with the Revo when leading~ because even their Dad and Mom shortrope them less often than when using the Grigri. ;) So we will still be carrying a Grigri to the crag~ but we are in the market for another Revo--let me know if you want to sell your used one! And we're very much hoping the Revo 2 will have assisted progress capture like a Grigri.   ,Mar 2016,Mar 15 2018,10

4429,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,6, We have now put the Revo through its paces on about 15 climbing days... That is great to hear.  It has now been over 3 months since I sent my Revo back to the manufacturer for testing/replacement.  I am still waiting for my replacement device to arrive.  I contacted them about a month ago and they said it could be several more months before they are able to get one to me~ though they were kind enough to offer a full refund if I ever got tired of waiting.  I've heard rumors that there was a recall in Canada~ but haven't been able to confirm that. And it doesn't appear there has been any official recall in the U.S.  It does appear that they are most likely reworking the design flaw that I originally reported and will hopefully get a slightly modified~ let's call it Revo ver 1.1~ out soon.   And I would love to see an easy lock off method in the next version for projecting routes.  If they had that~ it would eliminate the only reason to continue carrying a grigri for most people. ,Nov 2015,Mar 15 2018,2
4430,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,7," I posted a review on REI titled ""Excellent for Leading in the Gym"" The Revo does exactly what I had hoped - a very smooth feeding belay device with backup safety of assisted blocking. I've been using an ATC for lead and Grigri 2 for TR work. The Revo replaces the ATC and I've also replaced the G2 with ATC Pilot - another assisted blocker. I bought this with specific sole intention of gym work~ living in Atlanta and working means I spend 2 to 3 days a week climbing inside. I haven't used the device outside~ I like my ATC for that - it's light and effective + plus rapping. The Revo is heavy if you have a long hike in but for roadside cragging it would be fine.  I find the Revo less useful for TR as engaging the auto block can be a bit fiddly compared to G2 or ATC pilot. I have never had the auto block engage on lead falls~ the device catches like a tube~ friction is enough but 'drops' will lock it up. I have seen a climber dropped in the gym - 60ft is a long way. I have friends who have been dropped. I like the Revo as it nearly eliminates the chance of that scenario while feeding rope more smoothly that the G2.",Jan 2014,Apr 3 2018,0
4431,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,8, Very interesting--thanks. I've been using the Revo since it was first released and mostly love it. This helped me understand the engineering behind it. Given your understanding~ do you think it could be improved in a version 2.0 to easily engage the lock while holding a climber--or~ even better~ to give auto progress capture like a GriGri?,Mar 2016,May 1 2018,0
4432,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,9, Question to all of the engineering/physics types out there: My understanding is that the cam on a grigri held back by a spring that is overcome at a specific acceleration. They say that the revo locks when the wheel spins at a certain speed. Does this mean that the revo's assisted braking function is dictated by velocity and not acceleration?,May 2014,May 1 2018,1
4433,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,10, I've never actually seen or held a revo~ but that would make the most sense.  The braking is most likley governed by centrifugal force which would be a function of the angular velocity of the wheel as apposed to the acceleration of the rope.,Aug 2010,May 1 2018,0
4434,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,5,11, If the only benefit is paying out slack~ I would recommend the Mad Rock Lifeguard.  You lead belay just like an ATC~ however you can capture progress just like the Grigri.  Sounds like the perfect solution in my mind.  Plus it's a lot cheaper.,Feb 2009,May 1 2018,1

4447,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,4, You guys are ruining this thread. Also Andrew is right and eli and john are wrong/confused.,May 2011,May 2 2018,5
4448,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,5, In this context~ the mass ought to be constant so any change in force is directly attributable to a change in acceleration. In this case of the grigri~ a high acceleration of the rope causes a high force and when this force exeeds the force of the spring~ the cam engages. Regarding the bold text~ no~ not really. First off~ the mass is constant for a given climber~ but different climbers have different masses. For a given rope tension~ the deceleration will be drastically different between my 200-pound buddy and my 65-pound son. But the Grigri will lock at the same tension for both climbers~ not at a specific acceleration. Further~ for the rope~ a change in force is related to a change in strain~ which can happen rapidly (high acceleration) or slowly (low acceleration).  See my reply to John above. If you slowly apply tension to the climber strand (with the brake strand locked off)~ no rope will slip through the device~ and the cam will rotate and lock the rope. The Grigri won't fail to engage just because the acceleration was low. As long as enough tension is applied to the rope~ the device will lock.,Jul 2016,May 2 2018,0
4449,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,6, I think what you're refering to is the manual braking when force applied to the brake strand engages the cam. In the original question~ I was referring to the assisted braking function of a grigri~ not the manual braking function because I understand these to be different. No~ there is no difference.  Andrew is 100% correct.  The Gri Gri is activated by tension.  If the climber falls~ and the belayer's brake hand is locked down on the rope~ then no acceleration is necessary to lock up the GriGri.  It is the tension on the climbers strand that puts torque on the cam~ and causes it to engage.  It has nothing to do with acceleration.  There are 2 ways the climbers strand can end up being tensioned.  the first way is from the belayer clamping down/pulling on the brake strand.  The second is a result of friction of the rope running through the device (causing tension).  If you have a 1st generation grigri~ and try using it with a modern skinny slick rope (say 9.5mm) you will notice you can feed rope through the device dangerously easily (with great acceleration) without overriding the cam~ but as soon as you clamp down on the brake strand it will lock up.,Mar 2015,May 2 2018,2
4450,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,7," In this context~ the mass ought to be constant so any change in force is directly attributable to a change in acceleration. In this case of the grigri~ a high acceleration of the rope causes a high force and when this force exeeds the force of the spring~ the cam engages. As for your question on whether one or the other is inherently better~ I'd say it's a matter of opinion. A Revo doesn't really ""assist"" you in braking unless you screw up. It functions like an incredibly smooth-feeding ATC~ and the technique is identical. If you catch a fall with proper technique~ that fall is caught by the friction grooves on the device~ not the locking mechanism. Likewise~ unless you manually lock the device when your climber calls for a take~ you're the one holding your climber. On the other hand~ a Grigri ""assists"" your braking action any time the tension is high enough~ whether it's from a fall~ or just a hangdogging climber. Of course~ this necessitates the Grigri-specific technique for feeding slack quickly~ and many argue that it allows belayers to become lax in their technique. (For instance~ when belaying with an ATC~ you learn to clamp down on the brake strand with both hands when your climber falls. With a Grigri~ many only keep their brake hand on the rope.) I'll also point out that little to no rope moves through a Grigri when it locks~ whereas a Revo requires rope moving through it for it to lock. (Even if you catch a fall properly~ it functions more like and ATC~ so there is potential for rope slippage as you catch the fall.) The consequences of this are that a Grigri has the potential to generate higher loads on the top piece~ but it will also keep your climber higher off the deck at the end of their fall. I'll let you decided whether you feel this confers an advantage to one device or the other.",Jul 2016,May 2 2018,1
4451,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,8," As for your question on whether one or the other is inherently better~ I'd say it's a matter of opinion. A Revo doesn't really ""assist"" you in braking unless you screw up. It functions like an incredibly smooth-feeding ATC~ and the technique is identical. If you catch a fall with proper technique~ that fall is caught by the friction grooves on the device~ not the locking mechanism. Likewise~ unless you manually lock the device when your climber calls for a take~ you're the one holding your climber. On the other hand~ a Grigri ""assists"" your braking action any time the tension is high enough~ whether it's from a fall~ or just a hangdogging climber. Of course~ this necessitates the Grigri-specific technique for feeding slack quickly~ and many argue that it allows belayers to become lax in their technique.

I asked what~ if any~ differences in the assisted braking behavior of the devices~ potentially due to being governed by either velocity or acceleration~ or force if you prefer. And I'm refering the hands-free braking behavior when I say assisted braking~ like the official classification of locking assisted  braking devices as opposed to manual braking devices. ",May 2014,May 2 2018,0

(This is where I put the disclaimer that neither device is recommended for hands-free operation~ and they should not be used as such.) The Revo requires rope moving through the device at something like 4 m/s to lock up~ so the climber has fallen some distance by the time it engages. Again~ it's really just there to save your ass if you screw up or become incapacitated. The Grigri locks up when the friction through the device exceeds the tension necessary to engage the cam. This will be rope-dependent~ as cyclestupor pointed out. Skinny slick ropes will slip more before locking (unless they're too skinny to lock at all)~ and fat fuzzy ropes will lock more quickly.,Jul 2016,May 2 2018,0

Some would argue that a grigri is more likely to catch a fall unattended than in the hands of a belayer. I'm not saying that they should be used hands-free~ just that they can catch some pretty gnarly falls hands-free.,May 2014,May 2 2018,0
4454,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,11, I'm wondering if you people were paying out slack correctly if you were short roping.  If you put the brake end parallel  with the climber end rope~ it feeds just like an ATC.  This video kind of shows this example~ but It really needs to be more parallel.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BJf3OlBj0PR/  Yes~ we are all competent belayers and know how to feed rope.  The point I was trying to make is that despite how it was designed~ the cam would still engage when quickly paying out slack to a lead climber.  It does feed smoother than a grigri~ but the grigri is easier to override by using the finger catch and disengaging the cam with your thumb which in the end~ allows us to operate the device without short roping a lead climber.  The grigri is also easier to recover from if you do get into that situation.  What I loved about the Revo is that it is damn near impossible to short rope the climber because rope feeds so smooth around the wheel and we never engaged the locking mechanism when feeding rope~ no matter how fast we tried to pay out slack.  ,Nov 2015,May 3 2018,0
4455,WildCountry Revo - First Impressions,6,12, I might have missed out somewhere - however has anyone looked into how to clean up the Revo? I'm a Mammut Smart~ Smart Alpine user - so I have no problems cleaning out chalk dust~ fine sand out of the devices. Lately I did an ultrasonic bath cleaning for a friend's Lifeguard that had the release lever that stood perpendicular to the body of the device - and worked very well after touching up with a little drop of bicycle chain lube. The wheel device in the Revo looks like it'd cut quite a fair bit of unnecessary friction in the device - however I'm certain too that some of you would have been reading up about buying between bushing-type and bearing-type pulleys for efficiency - so the Revo probably has either~ which would probably benefit from an occasional cleaning plus a drop of lube. I'm wondering if the Revo was ever meant to be user-cleanable - I'm not even talking about being user-serviceable here :-p,Jul 2018,Jul 2 2018,0

4465,Beal 6mm Dyneema Slings,1,0, I have used slings of just about every make~ material~ and style~ over 30 years. These 6mm slings are really in another class. They are fantastically thin and light weight; I think unrivaled in this regard. The tubular webbing feels much more like chord and knots very well with a clove hitch. They excel at threading holes or tying off pins~ as well. The 60 cm are wonderful for trad draws~ while the 120 is a great lightweight substitute for a cord-o-lette (again~ I usually use with a clove hitch). I can curl up an entire 120 cm sling on a single Camp Nano 22. They have essentially changed my approach to anchors.  As far as disadvantages... you are sure to have a partner that will scoff at them! They are simply that tiny. Also~ apparently they are harder to source stateside. All the usual cautions with Dyneema apply~ of course (e.g. don't static load or use for prussiks).  Just my two yen's worth... Give em a shot~ if you are so inclined.  Cheers from Osaka~ john ,Dec 2008,Jun 16 2018,2

4469,Beal 6mm Dyneema Slings,1,4, Liberty Mountain~ Beal’s distributor in the U.S. has them for sale. I use both the 60cm and 120cm ice climbing and when weight matters and think they are pretty awesome. Yes they won’t hold up as well as fatter slings but neither will anything really light weight compared to fatter versions. There is no way a 8.5 mm cord is going to hold up like a 9.5mm or 10mm cord will in the same applications.   You have to keep this in mind when using any lightweight gear. There are trade offs. ,Aug 2006,Jun 16 2018,2
4470,Beal 6mm Dyneema Slings,1,5, Greetings.  I have the 8mm mammut slings and they are flat~ not round. Not sure if that was the case with the Mammut 6mm. Also~ the texture is quite a bit different.  At any rate~ as Sunny D says the expectation for longevity is likely going to be less with ultralight gear. I haven't worn mine out yet~ so I can't speak with regard to lifespan.  Thanks for the comments. ,Dec 2008,Jun 18 2018,0

4476,BD offset nuts!,1,0, Got my hands on the new BD offset stoppers. They’re available pretty much everywhere now. Around the same price as the DMM’s. $75 on Backcountry. Haven’t actually climbed on them yet~ but will next week and post updates. I’ve been climbing with my DMM’s for the last few years. I don’t even climb with regular stoppers anymore.   Initial impressions:-The colors correspond to the regular BD nuts.- The anodizing is glossy as opposed to the matte finish on the DMM’s.-The shapes are a little bit different with more rounded edges.-The full set comes with a oval wire gate~ which the DMM’s do not. ,Jul 2014,Jun 9 2018,2

4483,Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket vs Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka vs Rab Zero G,1,0," The Mountain Hardwear Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket is sort of a standard in ultralight down hoodies. My wife and I have owned a few of them over the years~ and we've considered them standard kit on moderately cold days. There are now a few other options worth considering. The Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket (Men's) is a trim-fitting jacket with fairly high set handwarmer pockets. It specs at 2.8oz of 800-fill down (Q-shield DWR down)~ which works out to 2240 cubic inches of down. It is fairly long cut~ with the back of mine extending to cover my butt. The hood and cuffs are simple elastic. The fabric is a 7d x 10d ripstop. The main zip is a small coil. My men's size medium weighs 235g/8.2oz~ and the women's small weighs 216g/7.6oz. Retail price is $350~ but deals can be easy to find as it is so widely distributed. The Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka is probably the closest direct competitor to the Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket. It has a similar feature set and a slightly wider cut. The cuffs are simple elastic~ and the zipper is a small coil. The hood does have a wire stiffener~ and it is more adjustable than the Ghost Whisperer's. The Plasma Parka specs at 3.4oz of 1000 fill down~ which works out to 3400 cubic inches of down~ or slightly over 50% more than the Ghost Whisperer. As far as I can tell~ the down Montbell uses does not have any DWR treatment. It features Montbell's 7d Ballistic Airlight ripstop fabric. The weight for an XS is 221g/7.8oz. Retail is $379~ and deals are basically non-existent. Comparing the Plasma 1000 Parka to the Ghost Whisperer~ the Plasma is puffier and undoubtedly warmer. The main body material is definitely ""crinklier"" on the Plasma~ but I suspect that that will diminish over time. The women's Small Ghost Whisperer and the unisex XS Plasma 1000 are within 10 grams of each other in weight. The Plasma has slightly more features and significantly more down. Besides price and availability~ the Plasma is definitely the ""better"" jacket for us. The Rab Zero G is another competitor to these jackets. It has a slightly longer and trimmer cut than either and a richer feature set. It comes with a stiffened brim on the hood like the Plasma. It has an additional hook and loop tab on the back of the neck to sort of roll and store the hood. The cuffs are much nicer~ featuring smooth elastic~ stretch woven cuffs similar to the great cuffs on the Arc'teryx Atom LT. The zipper is a beefy and reliable Vislon. The handwarmer pockets are set high to stay out of the way of a harness or pack waistbelt. It specs at 4.5oz of 1000 fill down~ which works out to 4500 cubic inches of down. Rab uses Nikwax Hydrophobic Down in all its down products. Its fabric is 7d Pertex Quantum GL~ which feels softer to me than Montbell's Ballistic Airlight. The weight for a Medium is 289g/10.2 oz. This is 54g/1.9 oz heavier than the Ghost Whisperer~ but the Zero G contains 51g/1.8oz more down specing at twice the total volume (2240 cubic inches vs 4500 cubic inches). Retail is a hefty $550~ and deals are moderately hard to find. Which jacket is best for you? All are probably equally durable. All have fairly similar body coverage. If price is a consideration~ the Ghost Whisperer remains a solid choice. It is light~ warm~ packable~ and can be found relatively cheap. The Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka has a slightly richer feature set than the Ghost Whisperer for a nearly identical weight~ and it is a warmer jacket. It is more expensive than the Ghost Whisperer~ and that cost difference may not be worth it to you. Nevertheless~ it is probably the overall best deal/performance ultralight down jacket available from the big manufacturers. The Rab Zero G is probably the most luxurious feeling jacket of the 3~ and it is the warmest. Basically all of its 2 ounce weight penalty over the other two jackets is extra down. Its astronomical price makes it unlikely to be the jacket of choice for most of us. Having said that~ you might be able to find a deal on the Zero G making it similar in price to the Plasma 1000 Parka. The Rab Zero G and the MHW Ghost Whisperer both feature DWR down~ though its efficacy is uncertain. That may be useful to you. http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-ghost-whisperer-down-hooded-jacket-1560921.html https://www.montbell.us/products/disp.php?p_id=2301257 https://rab.equipment/us/zero-g-jacket  ",Oct 2007,Jul 12 2017,1
4484,Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket vs Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka vs Rab Zero G,1,1, Also~ waterproof down~ like the Q-Shield Mountain Hardware uses is all I will buy any more. It's a deal breaker as where I live~ when that jacket gets deployed it's not uncommon that's it's due to a rain squall. The MH and Montbell both claim waterproof down but not the RAB it appears. That's a deal breaker. I have a couple of non-waterproof RAB down bags~ and they make good product~ never again will I buy non-waterproof down. Has anyone compared waterproofing of down? ,Mar 2006,Jul 13 2017,0
4485,Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket vs Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka vs Rab Zero G,1,2," Thanks~ Billcoe! Even though it is not listed~ Rab uses Nikwax Hydrophobic Down in all its down products: https://rab.equipment/us/support/faqs/ I have now added that to the review. However~ I am unable to find anything about Montbell using DWR or Hydrophobic down. I always carry my down jacket in a pack and didn't think about the stuff size. Neither the Zero G nor Plasma 1000 is designed to stuff into its own pocket~ but each comes with a stuff sack:   As down makes up the bulk of all of these jackets~ neither the Zero G nor Plasma can be expected to stuff as small as the Ghost Whisperer. However~ those included stuff sacks are too big~ and I can still easily compress each to about half its size:  The XS Plasma and Medium Zero G can each be compressed to a bit smaller than a 5"" sphere~ though that would require buying a proper size stuff sack. If harness carrying size takes precedence for you~ the Ghost Whisperer is probably the right choice",Oct 2007,Jul 13 2017,0
4486,Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket vs Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka vs Rab Zero G,1,3, Great review - have either of you tried the Arcteryx Cerium LT? Or is that not quite ultralight?,Feb 2013,Jul 13 2017,0
4487,Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket vs Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka vs Rab Zero G,1,4, I haven't used the Cerium LT. It appears to use a 10d fabric. I'm wary of the zoned Coreloft areas~ as even though it may work better in damp conditions~ Coreloft loses its insulating ability fairly quickly. In fact~ Arc'teryx CS has stated that they've seen Coreloft destroyed in 3-4 months when a Coreloft jacket has been compressed by a seat while driving 1-2 hours daily. That said~ if you don't compress it~ it might last longer than the outer fabric.,Oct 2007,Jul 13 2017,0

4491,Ghost Whisperer Down Hooded Jacket vs Montbell Plasma 1000 Alpine Parka vs Rab Zero G,1,8, I have had zero tears in it with probably 40 days in it~ including stuffing it in the top of a pack with other stuff. But I’m careful with it nonetheless. I try to have something else with me if I expect rain. Having said that~ two weeks ago I was in the Tetons and it got drizzled on continuously for a few hours in the morning.

4492,What's everyone's take on Kailas clothing?,1,0, Specifically the 9a. Durability?,May 2017,May 22 2018,0
4493,What's everyone's take on Kailas clothing?,1,1," I have the 9a ""winter""~ they are a slimmer fit~ but still ok with my thunder thighs. Snug low in the calf~ no need to roll them up to see feet on techy face~ only for heel hooks. This is the fit of mediums. I'm 5'8""~ ~160lbs with a 21"" thigh circumference.  The ""blue magic"" pant with an elastic waist and drawstring fits quite a bit more relaxed. Durability seems to be pretty decent. I've done a few offwidths and have not torn any holds yet. Fabric is mostly nylon. ",Jan 2015,May 22 2018,0
4494,What's everyone's take on Kailas clothing?,1,2, I have about 5 days of climbing to date in my pair of 9a pants.  They are the most comfortable climbing pants I have owned in 23 years of climbing.  Incredibly light & stretchy material and well cut design.  I also find them pretty stylish. I cannot comment on durability yet~ but the fabric is very thin (but looks like very good quality) so I am not expecting too much in that department... but time will tell.  My only gripe to date is the lack of any thigh pocket... the only pockets are covered by your harness when climbing.  I really like thigh pockets to keep topos etc for easy access while climbing~ so this may limit my use of these pants on long routes I don't know well enough to climb without a topo. Also~ be advised that these pants are sized for the Chinese market!  They are VERY small.  I normally wear jeans in size 35x35 or so (skinny & tall)~ and I have the 9a in XXL (!) and it's a very good fit (relaxed but the elastic waist is exactly right).  I had to undo the hem to lengthen them by an inch to make it perfect.  So~ I'd say the XXL is about a 35/36 waist by 34 inseam.   I'd suggest sending them an email with the waist x length you are looking for and having them suggest the closest matching size. Even with these drawbacks (lack of thigh pocket and -for me- having to undo the hem)~ I like them enough that I just ordered a second pair!,Oct 2004,May 22 2018,0
4495,What's everyone's take on Kailas clothing?,1,3, I have many 9a pants~ one Blue Magic and 2 El Capt. I size up for the 9a. I'm 5'9~ 160lbs and I wear usually M for all US-based company. For the 9a I'll take L. For Blue Magic I'll stay with M and it's great. For El Capt pants M is a tight fit. Most of my buyer did the same pattern as me: Size up the 9a~ take the same size for Blue Magic and maybe size up the El Capt.

4505,"Hyperlight Mountain Gear ""The Shell"" Jacket Review",1,0, Don't let the sticker shock stop you from checking this out. I have a feeling Dyneema will find itself in more clothing by more manufacturers over the next few years!,Nov 2012,Jun 6 2018,2
4506,"Hyperlight Mountain Gear ""The Shell"" Jacket Review",1,1, I'd like to give those who read this a little break down on the actual spec of the fabric. It's a 3 layer waterproof but not how you know it 1. Polyester face fabric 2. Non woven dyneema monofilimants arranged 90 degrees to one another 3. Event membrane Now while i haven't used this jacket a few things can be gathered from these specs. It's not abrasion resistant (at least not anymore than any other super light jacket)~ a super light weight polyester face fabric will not hold up it's just that simple~ you will wear through this face fabric. It will have excellent rip stop ability~ the non woven dyneema layer will make any form of cut impossible to get any bigger~ that is unless it gets caught on  on something like a nail or an ice tool which could potentially just rip the entire mono filament out of the jacket. The e-vent membrane is barely waterproof~ 10~000mm hydrostatic head is barely what the industry considers waterproof any wear will bring this number down so there's a good chance your jacket will leak after extended use~ so it's not durable. The membrane lacks a backer~ not it's intended use sure but you definitely don't want to wear this next to skin as the oils and sweat will destroy the membrane~ any zippers you may have on mid layers are also cause for concern as they will probably abrade the membrane (looks like the dvstrom membrane from e-vent). There is a completely non stretch fabric~ non woven dyneema mono filaments have roughly the same amount of stretch as steel this being said you will still get some stretch on the bias but this will be very minimal. So the biggest reason to drop the big chunk of change on this thing is durability but as far as i can tell it's not durable and it's barely waterproof so what's the point of this jacket even existing? Dyneema composite fabrics are great for tarps and tents but i really don't see the application in clothing~ or backpacks that are going to be abused at all.,Oct 2015,Jun 6 2018,3

4508,"Hyperlight Mountain Gear ""The Shell"" Jacket Review",1,3, You didn't read the marketing copy obviously. That seems to be all the jacket is~ marketing wank. Dyneema composites (previously known as Cuben fibre) is optimised for tensile strength (sails to be specific) and in it's inception was never meant to with stand any real abrasion all they have done is slapped on a woven polyester face fabric and called it good. They should have marketed it as the worlds first ever load bearing jacket~ the tensile strength of the fabric is just silly compared to it's comparatively non existent abrasion resistance.,Oct 2015,Jun 6 2018,4

4510,Scarpa Helix,1,0, Opinion on this shoe as an all around shoe,Feb 2017,Mar 2 2017,0
4511,Scarpa Helix,1,1, I have a pair. Decent entry level shoe. If you're just getting into climbing they're great until you learn better foot technique that won't destroy your feet and have a better idea what type of shoe you need. I've since bought a pair of Techno X~ and my Helixes (Helices?) have been relegated to gym duty.,Feb 2015,Mar 4 2017,1
4512,Scarpa Helix,1,2, If you haven't gotten shoes yet~ thehelix is a great pair.  They are super comfortable~ mold to your feet almost instantly~ and last a long time.  My wife still uses hers after 1 year of climbing twice a week.  I only traded mine in for vapor v's after 2 months because of a defect in one of the shoes ,Aug 2016,Apr 26 2017,0
4513,Scarpa Helix,1,3, I love my helixes for long trad multi-pitch days. They're affordable and confortable.,May 2013,Apr 26 2017,1
4514,Scarpa Helix,1,4, If you haven't gotten shoes yet~ thehelix is a great pair.  They are super comfortable~ mold to your feet almost instantly~ and last a long time.  My wife still uses hers after 1 year of climbing twice a week.  I only traded mine in for vapor v's after 2 months because of a defect in one of the shoes  Just curious on how your wife sized her helix. I have a friend who has been wanting to get into climbing but she's not sure how the sizing is for those,Jan 2017,Apr 26 2017,0
4515,Scarpa Helix,1,5, She's not into cramming her toes into her shoes~ so I think she just went with her street shoe size or maybe a half size smaller.  It's hard to tell.  Sometimes she wears a 7 US~ others a 7.5.  Her helix's are a 38.  ,Aug 2016,Apr 27 2017,1
4516,Scarpa Helix,1,6, I have two pairs~ one for comfort with the toes slightly curled~ one a half size smaller for precise edging. I'm of the opinion that the performance specs of a shoe don't matter all that much~ and it's the fit that counts. These are the only shoes I've found that fit my feet perfectly~ and they're a well built shoe~ so if they fit your foot~ go for it. The only areas I've found them lacking is on very steep (i.e. horizontal) terrain~ where some downturn would be helpful~ but that's not the shoe's fault; the flat sole is preferable for more vertical terrain. I would prefer a slightly stickier rubber on the heel for heel hooking. Note that the sole rubber is relatively hard~ great for edging~ not ideal~ though certainly not horrible~ for slab. I've spent plenty of time on hard 12 in these shoes~ and when I pop off it's because I suck~ not because of the shoes. If they fit your particular foot shape well~ they'll be a great all around shoe; if they don't~ they'll suck just like any other shoe would. ,Jun 2014,Apr 27 2017,1
4517,Scarpa Helix,1,7, Bnice~ Sorry~ I lied.  In normal shoes a 7.5 US would convert to a 38.  According to Scarpa's conversion~ her Helix's are a 40.  I had to go digging for the box.  ,Aug 2016,Apr 29 2017,1
4518,Scarpa Helix,1,8, I use my pair for my zen garden bouldering sessions and gym~ comfy~ wear a 9 USM street shoe~ 41 in Helix 41.5 in Techno~ performance is so so as is my ability and initiative.,Jan 2017,May 29 2018,0

4529,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,10, How is the Jannu for a tall guy~ out of curiosity? ,Sep 2013,May 22 2018,0
4530,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,11," Pretty ideal for me. The 90"" floor is really really nice (as said earlier im 6'3"") my feet dont touch the 'footwall' (not to be confused with football) and the head-side terminates close to the peak height so you don't have the 'claustrophobia' of  a standard dome style. I can sit up in it easily.  My only real beefs with it are that it is bulky/heavy (7 lbs) for anything thats a short term objective but has a long approach (though its definitely not bulky for a 4 season powerhouse tent). Also the vestibule is really really low angle~ to fit 2 packs in there and cook you have to cram the packs up to the front edge of the vestibule and press out the material a good foot or two. I get that the angle helps with wind~ nothings perfect~ but if im gonna have a vestibule it may as well be a fully functional one). also as with all 1 door tents it can be a hassle coming and going a lot with 2 people. I have slept 3 in there a handful of times and it was pretty doable. My jannu's been in some pretty gnarly conditions in chalten and the cordillera and definitely takes multi direction wind and wet snow like a champ. and the ventilation is amazing. Ive never actually pulled the liner and just pitched it as a rain shelter but im gonna play with that in the N cascades this summer and'll post more here. overall its the best tent ive ever used",Jul 2011,May 22 2018,1
4531,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,12, So with an inflatable sleeping pad and a big winter sleeping bag the ends of the bag don't touch the walls? Nice. ,Sep 2013,May 22 2018,0
4532,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,13, exactly. its friggin great. and worse case scenario (for even taller folk) you could just slide your head toward the door (or open the door and stick your head out a little bit) that way your footbox wont ever touch the footwall of the tent.,Jul 2011,May 22 2018,0
4533,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,14, I happened to order the Rab last week. If you decide you don't want to sleep in the fetal position in the MSR and can carry an extra 14oz~ I think you'd probably be happier with it. The ends of my -20F bag just touch the walls~ but it's more of a condensation issue (that you could alleviate by wrapping the footbox in a shell) than actually compressing your insulation like the Firstlight and I imagine the MSR. It's also wider if you're gonna fit another human in there. It's definitely intended for cold weather~ the door and vent don't have bug netting. Edit: to be clear I'm talking about the Latok Mountain 2~ not the Latok Summit. ,Sep 2013,May 23 2018,0
4534,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,15, good to know! hows the packed size on that bad boy? similar to the eldorado i imagine?,Jul 2011,May 23 2018,0
4535,Black Diamond Eldorado-Packed Size???,1,16, I've never owned an Eldo so can't say for sure.  The thing is~ a lot of these tents seem at lot bigger if you use the manufacturer's stuff sack because they usually try to cram the poles in there. For the Firstlight BD actually gives you separate stuff sacks instead which helps. The Firstlight is thin fabric and super packable anyway~ but still.  This particular Rab tent~ like the Firstlight~ is nothing but fabric and fairly compressible (ie no fancy plastic clips). Here's the Rab in the factory sack with poles and stakes inside. And for comparison the tent alone fit easily into one of my sleeping bag stuff sacks. Can always strap the poles to the outside of your pack. I'm pretty sure you could also pack the Eldo more efficiently than what it looks like in that video.,Sep 2013,May 23 2018,0

4538,Evolv Addicts?,1,0, Hello~ my moccasyms recently broke down and I was looking to buy a similar pair of shoes.  Does anyone happen to have a review of the Evolve Addicts (which are modeled off the moccs)?  My main concern is the heel.  I wear a street shoe size of 8.5/EU 41 and have the moccs in 7.5/EU 40 (although after stretching they feel a bit larger than I would prefer.  I have a fairly small heel~ and when I wear the La sportiva Miura laces in EU 39.5 the back of the shoe digs into my achilles tendon to the point where I do not feel safe wearing the shoes.  However~ on my Moccs there seems to be too much space in my heel area.  I was wondering if anyone knows how the sizing of the addicts compares to the moccs~ especially in terms of the heel. I am hoping the addicts have a smaller heel area (lower volume I guess?).  Thanks!,Jan 2018,Jan 27 2018,0
4539,Evolv Addicts?,1,1, I've climbed in moccs (they're my favorite shoe!) and have never owned a pair of addicts myself but the two friends of mine who have say the heel is SUPER LOOSE.  As in they both expressed that they felt they might come off while climbing~ and not necessarily on a heel-hook.  As always: I'd recommend you try a pair on before you buy but if you think the moccs were loose in the heel I can't imagine you'll think the addicts to be any better in that regard.,Mar 2013,Jan 27 2018,1
4540,Evolv Addicts?,1,2, Yes~ I love the the addicts but the heel is super loose.,Jun 2016,Jan 27 2018,1
4541,Evolv Addicts?,1,3, Thanks!  By loose do you mean there is dead space in the heel~ or just that it is prone to slipping off? ,Jan 2018,Jan 29 2018,0
4542,Evolv Addicts?,1,4, Prone to slipping off and not narrow or tight imo,Jun 2016,Jan 29 2018,0
4543,Evolv Addicts?,1,5, I have both.  Addicts fit tight so buy your street shoe size.  Mocks size down to your preferred style of climbing.  The adicts heel is way tighter then the moccasins.   I like them both moccasins for comfort and cracks bigger then #1.  Addicts gym and thin.,Dec 2014,Jan 30 2018,1
4544,Evolv Addicts?,1,6, Since you're getting mixed responses~ I am going to leave these pics for you to judge for yourself (of course you should just try on a pair~ but seems like that isn't an option for you).   These are two well worn pairs of mine side by side. The heel cup on the addict is quite wide~ and the rubber is stiff in that bulbous shape. Maybe some folks are calling it tight because the rubber digs into their heel/ankle at the top? I have fairly wide feet and large cankles and this has not been my experience. The moc's ankle is more narrow and supple~ and will stretch to fit your heel more precisely. I prefer wearing them both with socks (addicts in 11.5 or 12 and mocs in 11 or 11.5)~ though I have more aggressively fit addicts in size 11 which I will wear sock-free for gym bouldering. I use addicts in the gym and Mocs for outdoor easy climbing.,Jun 2016,Jan 30 2018,3
4545,Evolv Addicts?,1,7, Thanks!  Are the shoes in both the images the same size?  The addicts seem MUCH more narrow than the moccs.,Jan 2018,Feb 1 2018,0

4552,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,0, Back in march of this year(2013) I purchased a new 60meter 9~5 energy ARC from an authorized retailer. On the first day out with this rope~ and on the first fall~ the sheath exploded~ exposing the core. The fall was minimal~ maybe 2-3meters total~ about 7 bolts up~ overhanging~ on new~ but tested gear~ without any significant rope contact with the the rock. We also thoroughly inspected the quickdraws~ belay device and carabinier for burs and sharp edges~ but found none. Convinced this was a freak accident I returned and replaced the rope with another 60meter 9~5 energy ARC. It has now been about 4 months since the purchase of the new rope~ and I'm finding the sheath to be breaking down very quickly. I have been using a new~ but different belay device~ and have been climbing almost exclusively in gyms. There has been no trauma to the rope that could cause this break down in the sheath fibers with normal use. I take very good care of my ropes~ and am concerned when they don't perform as promised by the manufacturer. Both ropes have now been returned~ but I would really like some type of explanation or further testing to restore some type of confidence to me~ my climbing friends~ and the climbing community as a whole. There seems to be a major flaw in the sheath design~ and it needs to be addressed before someone gets hurt.     I have made further efforts to contact the manufacturer.  Please reply if you would like to read the email response from the distributor.  I was not impressed.    Core Shot on first fall.  Notice how shiny new the rope is.    Excessive wear on the replacement rope in only a few months.  Much of the rope looks like this.,Aug 2013,Aug 22 2013,0
4553,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,1, Shit - that's the same rope I have~ but in a 70m.    Only used a few times for multi~ no falls~ no abnormal wear.

4554,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,2, Is this the rope thy was on eBay for $110 a few years ago?  It looks just like the one I bought (from eBay). I immediately cut it in half and used for gym ropes. I fall a lot in the gym. No problems yet~ been using one side for a year or so.,May 2009,Aug 22 2013,0
4555,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,3, OMG. I purchased the same rope the end of May~ used it on moderate trad routes mainly in BoCan for a couple months and the sheath got totally frayed and fuzzed out~ just like your replacement rope picture. I've never seen this sort of wear before and thought it was very disturbing. I have ropes that are 5-10 years old that didn't look that bad. No falls were taken~ well~ maybe a toprope hang or two. I returned it to REI and they took it back~ no problem.    I'm really interested in what the manufacturer said. Please email me their response.,Jan 2008,Aug 22 2013,0
4556,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,4," I have the exact same rope in a 70m. I have abused the hell out of it~ left it stashed in the alpine~ taken to many falls to count (trad and sport)~ and it is still going strong. That is bizarre that it exploded like that~ I have seen the same on Sterling and Petzle ropes with no explanation. Hopefully~ they will replace it. My guess is it was some weird circumstance in the fall that is not apparent rather than a ""bad batch"".   Oh~ and I have the same little sheath fuzzies on mine~ has'nt developed into anything further. Perhaps they are due to the different sheath weave used for that line of ropes?",Nov 2007,Aug 22 2013,0

4564,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,12, the assumption that it is the sheath design that is the problem is most likely not the case for a variety of reasons. first- there are only so many sheath designs that work to create a dynamic rope- and this particular sheath design has been in use by Edelweiss for the better part of a decade (or longer~ their ropes have had this pattern for as long as i can remember). second-all kernmantle ropes are made the same way for the most part.   i'm really curious on this particular failure- the black and yellow threads all failed in the same spots~ but the red threads all stayed intact- bizarre~ and i cant think of an explanation for it. a bad air splice may account for one or two threads blowing~ but not that many. corrosion or a sharp edge would have blown at least some of the red threads...really really odd core shot.    did you return the rope to the manufacturer directly~ or distributor or retailer? Depending on who you sent it back to~ it may take a while to get to Edelweiss or it may not get there at all if the person handling returns doesnt think it warrants inspection. If i were Edelweiss~ though~ i'd want the batch # on that rope and that rope in hand ASAP.,unknown,Aug 23 2013,0

4569,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,1,17, Why are you using a 60m 9.5 for climbing in the gym?  But seriously~ I had the same rope in 70 and it was a piece of junk.

Doesn't seem like a great bet to buy this rope.,Oct 2007,Nov 2 2013,0

4577,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,2,4, I don't have pictures~ but I've posted about my Edelweiss rope in another thread... mine immediately developed significant sheath frays all close together at two places on the rope. There was no damage or wear to the rope to cause it. My only explanation based on how the fray formed was that the manufacturer was splicing multiple strands of sheath thread simultaneously. There was different colored strands of nylon sticking out of the weave~ all neatly trimmed~ in an otherwise brand new and undamaged sheath~ all at exactly the same spot on the rope. As if they paused the machine~ changed out 3 or 4 spools at once~ then resumed.   The damage to my rope stopped there~ though. It has held up well since~ except that it's a cable. All the same~ I can see how this manufacturing practice could lead to weak spots in the sheath and cause core shots.,Apr 2012,Feb 23 2016,0
4578,EDELWEISS Energy Arc 9.5 mm Sheath Failure,2,5, Your comment on the colors appears to be a major clue. The red thread is running primarily along the axis of the rope~ while the black and yellow are running primarily perpendicular. Something likely sliced the rope sheathing as it was being pulled (or slid through equipment) ~damaging black and yellow~ but not red. This could have been from the manufacturer~ too~ but it's too curious that it's only in that one direction.,Jun 2015,May 14 2018,0
4579,KALENJI Trail Running Bag/Vest 10L Review,1,0, Steep approaches~ weighty loads~ and full days make climbing in the alpine a serious affair. Likewise~ climbers with big alpine goals should take their training seriously. Training for various mountaineering activities is within my weekly schedule. Amongst other training activities~ I often go for mountain/trail run. For such training activity~ the gear one needs is minimum. A pair of short pants~ a T-Shirt~ a pair of trail runners and for long distanced a kind of hydration bag.Read full review with many photos here:https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/kalenji-trail-running-bag-vest-10l-review/ For training days up to 15k~ I usually run without any hydration bag~ but if I go for longer distances~ especially in summer time~ I prefer to have some water with me. In the past I have used various options~ but I came to the conclusion that my preferred option is to carry a lightweight hydration bag/vest~ and especially the Kalenji Trail Running Bag 10L.,Oct 2017,May 14 2018,2

Gym personnel  tried it and didnt seem to like it.I am selling it but purchased the grigri2 and am very happy with it. This is my personal opinion So the device seemed to engage the cam to easily while lowering at the gym? I'd guess the gym might be using pretty fat/stiff gym ropes~ 10.5 or thicker. For those climbing outside on 10.5 and skinnier ropes the GriGri+ is awesome~ especially because it can handle skinnier ropes that the GriGri 2... My in depth review of the GriGri+ is here: https://northeastalpinestart.com/2017/05/18/gear-review-petzl-grigri/,Nov 2012,Oct 18 2017,3
4586,Grigri+,1,6," Yes Doug i took the grigri+ to gym i understand this sweet spot~ but it was annoying for me personally~  while lowering off of top rope it kept locking no matter how careful i was. Gym personnel  tried it and didnt seem to like it.I am selling it but purchased the grigri2 and am very happy with it. This is my personal opinion I replaced my grigri2 with a grigri+.  It's not really an issue of ""being careful"" or not~ it's just geometry.  If you pull the lever past a certain angle~ the cam locks back up.  That's it. With the 2 the comfortable method is to grasp the brake strand~ release the lever~ and when you feel the cam disengaging (the rope tries to move)~ you gradually release your grasp so the rope feeds through the device.  If you try to do this with the grigri+ you'll cause it to lock every time. Instead~ pull the lever to where experience tells you is before the ""lock"" re-engages.  Then gradually release your grasp.  Finally~ through combination of fine-tuning the lever and grasp you control how fast the rope feeds. It's different for sure~ but after a short period of acclimating to the change I find the + feeds rope significantly more smoothly when lowering both on top rope (with rope wraps increasing friction at the top) and on lead. Is the above too much effort?  Well~ just crank the lever back~ let it lock~ and crank it back some more and you've got classic grigri2 behaviour.  YMMV of course.  ",Jan 2015,Oct 26 2017,1
4587,Grigri+,1,7, I realize this is an old thread but PSA: you can override the anti-panic on the GriGri+ so it lowers just like a GriGri 2. All you have to do is continue to pull back further on the handle and voila! I do this every time I lower on gym ropes.,Dec 2017,Dec 20 2017,3
4588,Grigri+,1,8, Technology is progress real quick even in rock climbing equipments. No doubt grigri is a good belay device. I owned a first generation grigri.  It could be dangerous for beginners not in terms of safety but the lost of knowledge of using a ‘traditional’ belay devices. I noticed in forums there’s many questions were asked like:  1. How to use an ATC belay device 2. How to abseil with ATC 3. How to top belay with ATC & etc grigri indeed a very convenient device but less versatile compared to a more traditional devices like figure 8~ ATC & etc. When I climb with newer climbers I’ll make it a point that they start with ATC before using a grigri. I do not wish the newer generation of climbers lost the essence of how to operate a basic belay device.  Just sharing my thoughts. ,Dec 2017,Jan 22 2018,5
4589,Grigri+,1,9, I used a new grigri+ today for the first time~ I think the only thing that makes it better than the 2 or original is that a hundred pound climber will have a much easier time lowering a 200lb climber. I'll be wearing out my current grigris before buying a +.  YGD.,Mar 2006,Apr 5 2018,0
4590,Grigri+,1,10, Why is that any easier?  Just curious~ aren't the mechanics of it the same? ,Jul 2017,Apr 6 2018,0
4591,Grigri+,1,11, Why is that any easier?  Just curious~ aren't the mechanics of it the same?  It only lets you lower someone at about 1/2 speed~ after you get used to it you can finesse it into lowering faster but never as fast as the originals let you. I can see why many people said its perfect for gyms and new climbers. It didnt feed rope any better IMO~ just smoother lowering.,Mar 2006,Apr 6 2018,0
4592,Grigri+,1,12, It only lets you lower someone at about 1/2 speed~ after you get used to it you can finesse it into lowering faster but never as fast as the originals let you.  Totally wrong. See above (or the Petzl documentation) for instructions on overriding anti panic. ,Dec 2017,Apr 6 2018,1

4594,Grigri+,1,14, As a person who has exclusively used an ATC up to this point~ should I get the 2 or the +?  The reviews seem pretty split on the +~ with a number of people saying get the 2 instead.  But is that just because the + is a little different technique than the 2 that they were all accustomed to?  ,May 2018,May 11 2018,0
4595,Grigri+,1,15, I love the plus. I went from ATC to gri gri two and sold the two and continued to use an ATC for about another two years. I then decided to go back and give a gri gri a try again and went with the plus. I find it is a little easier to feed on lead. Enough so that I have kept it and use it exclusively now. Its not hard to find the sweet spot for lowering like some have suggested and also it can be overridden if you continue to pull back on the lever. Since most gri gri accidents I have heard of are because of panicking and continuing to hold the lever down I think the added function of the plus is a big plus. Also it has a smaller lip for your index finger that has less purchase but I find with the easier feeding of the + it works well. I think they wanted it this way so that when a climber does fall your finger will slip off easier letting the cam engage. just and extra design feature I found that could prevent something unlikely but still was addressed in this design. ,Dec 2013,May 11 2018,2

4625,Marmot 8000m Suit Review,1,9," All you do is explain the features. A review implies you've used it and can actually comment on the functionality of said features. Climb Rainer in Winter and walk around at night for a few hours in a snow storm and then update your review with actual experience.   Also~ another reason you might be getting hostile comments here is becasue these down suits are almost totally irrelevant for modern alpinism. This is mostly a site for actual climbers who usually don't have the motivation~ time or money to slog up 8~000 meter peaks~ which is what this thing is designed for (aside from use in polar regions) How much did this thing cost you? I think taking a trip to the Andes for more experience would have been a better use of your money if you're trying to climb mountains in the greater ranges of the world. But~ if you're a gear head like you say~ then its fun to have! Just don't post ""reviews"" here and expect it to be well-received. Also~ sell that monstrosity to some yuppie headed to Everest (no offense) and go to Peru and hire a guide to have a go at peaks like Artesonraju or Nevado Picso. You'll love it.

4626,Marmot 8000m Suit Review,1,10, Uh~ the difference between your review and the one by Mosedale is that he wore a one piece suit more days last year above 6000m than you have spent in your life above 3000m. The last time you were wearing a one piece suit was when yer momma was changing yer nappy. Seriously if you want to do reviews~ do reviews of products that you have used~ in the environment in which the were designed for~ and within your experience. Otherwise you have no credibility.,Jul 2007,May 3 2018,1
4627,Marmot 8000m Suit Review,1,11, Fair enough.  I guess I can understand why the 'review' part might have been misleading.  I'll try to be more straightforward in the future~ perhaps 'initial impressions' or something like that would have been a better choice of words.  And I totally get that most climbers will never need one of these.  I got it 60% off~ which is the main reason I went ahead and bought it.,Jan 2016,May 3 2018,2

4629,Ucraft Titanium Alloy Belay Glasses - review,1,0, I bought Ucraft Titanium Alloy Belay Glasses off of amazon.com for $49 somewhat recently and I have to say they are really nice. I find them to work just as well as my friend's CU belay glasses that were more than double the price. And I find the hinges are easier to deal with putting them away rather than the sprung arms of the CU brand. They come with a carrying case with a non-load bearing carabiner~ spare nose piece~ spare screws~ cloth to wipe the prisms~ and a tiny screwdriver to replace the screws in the hinges. The frame and prisms are minimal enough to see around them when spotting for before the first clip or when having to reposition where you are standing while lead belaying. I really enjoy not having neck discomfort while belaying. Like any belay glasses they take some adjustment and practice to get used to them. The only drawbacks I've found is that if you wear prescription glasses like I do~ they fall off your face when you bend your head down if you put them on and are checking your belay setup. Once you keep your head level they are fine. They also don't work with some prescription glasses were the bridge piece between the lenses sticks out too far as they don't have enough room to sit on your nose. In my case~ one of my glasses the bridge piece bends outward in a half circle and this is enough to make them not usable with these. The case is a lot more flimsy than I thought it would be. It's like plastic blister pack thick with no padding inside. It won't survive any significant crushing impact. It's merely to hold them off of a gear loop. Also the carabiner mount point is off to the side such that it doesn't hang straight down. I think they were a good deal and priced much more reasonably for a thin metal frame than other brands.  Where I bought it:https://www.amazon.com/Ucraft-Glasses-Climbers-Ultralight-Titanium/dp/B01NCVUQ15/ The manufacturers web site:https://ucraftclimbing.com/accessories/belay-glasses/titanium-alloy-belay-glasses.html,unknown,Apr 7 2018,1

4631,Ucraft Titanium Alloy Belay Glasses - review,1,2, Meh... I ordered a pair from Amazon and both prisms fell off the frame on arrival. Ended up getting a pair of metal frame y&y (clearly what the Ucraft is knocking-off of) on sale for $15 more. Haven't looked back.,Jul 2006,Apr 7 2018,1
4632,Ucraft Titanium Alloy Belay Glasses - review,1,3, Belay Specs are pretty pricey ($80 like 6 years ago)... but when the glue on one of the prisms failed (after 5 years of use)~ I sent them in for a $20 refurbishment and basically got a brand-new pair back~ complete with a new polishing cloth and extra replacement nose-pieces.  Pretty great customer service.,Sep 2010,Apr 7 2018,0

4634,Ucraft Titanium Alloy Belay Glasses - review,1,5, Just the prisms are 21mm wide by 12mm high. But to see around them you need to account for metal frame on the outside of the prisms that folds over the side and the slight bit under it. That puts the width at 25mm and the height at 13mm. I find them very easy to see around and that is an advantage in my opinion. They don't block a lot of your vision like some of the thick plastic frame belay glasses do. ,unknown,Apr 8 2018,0
4635,Ucraft Titanium Alloy Belay Glasses - review,1,6, No~ no real issues with visibility or anything else. I also have a pair of Belay Specs.  The Belay Specs are nicer~ but given they cost 3.5x what the Ucraft plastics do~ I would just get the plastics. They work just fine for watching a climber. ,Nov 2006,Apr 9 2018,0

4638,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,2, Consistency has been my experience for the last 20 Years or so.  Mythos~ then Testarossas~ then Miura Vs~ then also Katanas and now Futuras. All pretty much size 39. Some slight differences from shoe style to shoe style though.  Solutions are 39.5~ for example,Nov 2007,Mar 22 2018,0
4639,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,3, I feel like the sizing changed on the TC Pro's a couple years back. I consistently wore a 40 for my comfy pair (went through several pairs). When I purchased a pair in that size last year~ they felt too big. Got a 39.5 instead. My beater resoled 40's fit like my (now also resoled beater) 39.5's. I also think there was a subtle change with the rand. It seems to extend a bit further up the foot (more rand) in the current iteration. Of course~ I may be crazy~ but I have had many pairs of that shoe~ and know them pretty well...,Mar 2010,Mar 22 2018,0
4640,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,4, I feel like the sizing changed on the TC Pro's a couple years back. I consistently wore a 40 for my comfy pair (went through several pairs). When I purchased a pair in that size last year~ they felt too big. Got a 39.5 instead. My beater resoled 40's fit like my (now also resoled beater) 39.5's. I also think there was a subtle change with the rand. It seems to extend a bit further up the foot (more rand) in the current iteration. Of course~ I may be crazy~ but I have had many pairs of that shoe~ and know them pretty well... I agree~ first TC pros I had were my favorite shoes... all subsequent pairs have been wider across the ball of the foot. They start out OK due to initial stiffness~ then become very sloppy fit. This is not a result of choosing a size that's too large~ it is a change in width between older and newer ones.,Mar 2009,Mar 22 2018,0
4641,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,5, Size consistency also varies a little bit from shoe to shoe in the same model/year as the shoes are made by hand. It's always a good idea to try on a pair of shoes before purchasing them. If they fit funky~ try another pair of the same shoe and model.  https://www.sportiva.com/blog/la-sportiva-factory-behind-the-scenes/?dir=asc&order=user  ,Jan 2014,Mar 22 2018,0
4642,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,6," In general~ yes. But as with any handmade item~ you can get some variation.  Testarossa's in size 36 were my standard shoe size for years~ I've had multiple pairs. Then last year I ordered another pair~ same size. And they felt WAAAYYYY tighter~ and not just tighter~ but they felt like they had couple hot spots~ and just wouldn't break in after multiple attempts. (They usually feel tight~ but comfortable right out of the box for me~ and certainly feel broken in after couple sessions~ but this particular pair just wasn't doing it). After multiple attempts to break them in~ a couple of blisters~ an e-mail to La Sportiva (the response was basically~ you can take them to a resoler to stretch~ but it voids all warranty... and oh~ we can't take them back since you have worn them multiple times~ nothing is torn or broken~  it doesn't appear that there is anything wrong with the shoe)~ an attempt to stretch them-- failed~ because the resoler didn't have the shoe stretcher small enough that it would fit these shoes~ I decided that maybe my feet have changed in the past year and I need a pair 1/2 size bigger. So I ordered a pair that is size 36.5. And they are a touch too big. I'm wearing them~ they are generally fine and I have no problem with the toeing/edging~ but I feel the air pocket in the heel on heel hooks~ and I have never had this issue with size 36. I now believe that this one pair was just off~ and when I get a new pair~ it would be size 36 again. Couple people have told me that they had a similar issue with just one pair of  La Sportiva shoes of the exact same size/model over the years~ where their standard size shoe was somehow not fitting them~ but the next pair in the exact same size was fine again. But there doesn't seem to be a specific timeline attached to it. My friend had an ""off"" pair of testarossas about 6 years ago~ while I had no problems 6 years ago. Another friend had the same issue with Miuras a few years back~ but again~ not 6 years~ and not last year.",Mar 2011,Mar 22 2018,0
4643,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,7, I have two pairs of size 42 Muira VS and they fit pretty differently. One is a very snug fit~ but the other pair is significantly larger (although they still work fairly well).,Aug 2017,Mar 22 2018,0
4644,La Sportiva size/last consistency,1,8, I've definitely noticed that there is a difference on one pair of my katana laces~ they are about 1/4 size larger than the others. Chock that up to inconsistency being hand made~ I'm sure it's just a very slight difference in cut of a section or stitching.  Some models fit similarly~ but I've found a spread across the line. 40.5 tc pro was a slightly knuckled big toe edging fit. A 39.5 in a skwama is about equally tight (for it's last shape~ obviously the toes are far more knuckled up in that one). A 39.5 maverink is flat and roomy. ,Jan 2015,Mar 23 2018,0

4646,Alpine Luddites New Day Rising climbing pack review,1,0, Here is a recent review of my New Day Rising pack from Climbing Gear Reviews UK ,Feb 2017,Mar 20 2018,3
4647,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,0, I am looking to buy a set of half ropes~ mostly for Multi pitch trad climbing.    I have been looking at the Beal Opera or the joker some thing light and skinny. Ive got plenty of experience using other peoples the half rope.   I am wondering if anybody has any recommendations on ropes and can give some feed back on how they have preformed over time. These would not be my primary ropes I figure I would use them on routes that need a double rope rap or with 3 people.    thoughts?,Feb 2012,Feb 16 2017,0

4649,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,2, I dig em. They are pretty common in Europe.,unknown,Feb 16 2017,0
4650,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,3, Two followers? stick to ropes above 8mm like:   Sterling - Duetto Evolution 8.4mm   Mammut - Genesis 8.5mm   Smaller ropes have a tendency of pinching and locking using ATC guide or reverso.,Nov 2006,Feb 17 2017,0
4651,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,4, +1 on the Mammut Genesis 8.5. I've got a pair and they handle quite well. At 47g/m you certainly feel much lighter. Can't attest to their durability as I only use them on rare occasions. But I can't imagine I'd want to climb on anything thinner. The dry treatment repels dirt nicely. Overall I'd def recommend Genesis~ but keep in mind if multi pitch trad makes up the majority of your climbing~ you'll be putting them through the wringer.  I imagine you can get several workhorse ropes for the price of a pair of half ropes. Although the Genesis dry is going for $150 on backcountry.com at the moment w/ free shipping. Good luck!,May 2014,Feb 17 2017,0

4654,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,7, If you're primarily climbing lower angle alpine with a lot of abrasion the beal pro mountain has a really thick sheath.    I've put a lot of mileage on an 8mm phoenix~ by itself folded over for mostly simul climbing alpine or combined with my 9mm sterling nano for half ropes. Actually I've lead on it as a single strand a few times too~ but we don't admit that on the internet.    Sheath has held up well. Catch is actually a tad firmer than expected. Only knocks on it are that it's very supple and can turn into medusa's hair with poor management on rappel (never munter rap on it~ only plates).,Jan 2015,Feb 20 2017,1
4655,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,8, Recently got the petzl mambos 8.5mm~ there not bad. At 47g/m they felt pretty heavy to me by the full length of a 60 meter pitch. I can't say I recommend (I cant compare them to anything else) them but i belive they're the most inexpensive half rope (in the 8mm range) and they get the job done.,Jul 2013,Mar 4 2017,0
4656,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,9," ""Buy""",Nov 2009,Mar 4 2017,0
4657,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,10, If you are not using half-rope technique a lot~ then I'd do as you suggest and get a triple-rated rope like the Joker. They are as thin as the half ropes we used back in the good old days~ but are rated as single ropes as well~ making them incredibly useful / flexible.    I have used the Sterling Nano 9.2 (current edition is 9mm) and Beal Joker (9.1) and Mammut Finesse (9.3) triple rated ropes and liked them all. I think the Mammut Serenity is the skinniest of the current crop at 8.7(!) - I haven't tried this~ but they make exceptional ropes.     They are obviously not as durable as beefier singles. I got 4 years use out of my Nano~ and 3 out of my Joker~ climbing only once a month or so~ but on some pretty sharp rock. But one sharp edge can kill your rope in a single pitch - you need to be careful how you use them. Same goes for half ropes of course. But unless you are a real specialist half-rope user~ I'm not sure why you'd go for half-rated ropes instead of one of these.,Sep 2010,Mar 5 2017,0

4659,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,12, Alex~ I am definitely looking triple rated ropes the Mammute Serenity is high on my list. I have also been looking at the Beal Opera also triple rated at 8.5mm it seems pretty neat.    I am mostly looking to use them for long multi pitch days that would require 2 ropes to get down.,Feb 2012,Mar 8 2017,0
4660,Looking to by some Half ropes,1,13, I have a brand new pair of Mammut Genesis ropes (rated as twins and halfs) that I may be willing to part with.  Got them in December (still in plastic) but haven't had a chance to use them b/c of work,Jul 2008,Mar 8 2017,0

4663,Hestra Ergo Grip Outdry Gloves Review,1,0, I figured I would give my $0.02 on these gloves since there seems to be a lack of information on them and to hopefully save people from spending a nice chunk of change on these gloves. I picked these gloves up in late October 2017 for the upcoming ice season.  I was looking for a waterproof glove with low volume and high dexterity for leads on ice.  A bit about my skills: Ive ice climbed for 4 seasons~ climb/lead in the WI4 range~ and rarely get on drytool/mixed routes (working there slowly).  I also used these gloves for backcountry touring. The pros: Dexterity?  Check.  These gloves have exceptional dexterity and are great for picking around your overcrowded harness~ handling/driving screws~ building anchors~ working biners~ and clipping rope.  They truly are a waterproof glove~ which is great for keeping hands dry when climbing ice in moderate/warm temps.  They worked in a surprisingly wide range of temps given the lack of insulation.  Ive used them while climbing in 0 F temps and while the hands were chilly~ they never got ridiculously cold.  Naturally~ after climbing~ warmer gloves went on.  Cons: the only issue I can find~ but it is a big issue~ with these gloves is their durability. After 15 days of ice climbing and 15 days of backcountry touring~ I have worn holes in almost every finger. I was diligent about applying glove balm to keep the leather is tip top shape.  When I questioned Hestra about this~ they indicated that these gloves~ which are part of their mountaineering category mind you~ were not intended for gripping ice tools...seriously.   Given that these gloves are close to $200 retail~ and part of their mountaineering series~ I would have expected better longevity than lasting all of 15 days on ice.  Again~ these gloves fit amazing and climb super well~ but if you get them~ dont expect them to last more than a season.,Mar 2017,Mar 19 2018,3
4664,Hestra Ergo Grip Outdry Gloves Review,1,1, Looks more to do with rope handeling then tool wear. Did you do lots of TR belaying and lowering with these. I could see that burning holes in them supper fast.,May 2016,Mar 19 2018,0
4665,Hestra Ergo Grip Outdry Gloves Review,1,2, That is a good thought and definitely makes more sense than gripping tools and working screw gate lockers. Rappin: yes~ but always run an autoblock for a back up~ so Im mainly gripping the friction hitch~ not the rope.  TR belaying: not a ton.  If it was a super warm day then maybe I would belay in them.  I had warmer gloves I would use for belaying.  Most of the routes around me are also long enough to necessitate a top managed belay and rappin back down.,Mar 2017,Mar 19 2018,1

4674,Simond 2-in-1 Mountaineering Gloves Review,1,0, Winter mountaineering activities can be very enjoyable if the gear used is good and appropriate for the conditions. One of the most important gear items for winter mountaineering ascents are naturally gloves. Simond 2 in1 Mountaineering Glove is designed for mountaineering and it has all the features you normally see on products double its price. So you get a liner glove that has synthetic insulation~ and you could wear this on its own. But you also get an outer glove with a waterproof Novadry membrane~ which you could also wear on its own. Goat leather palms~ a nose wipe~ a wrist leash and more make these gloves fully featured.  For full review with many more photos feel free to see here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2018/02/22/simond-2-in-1-mountaineering-gloves-review/  Simond is based in the Chamonix Valley~ at the foot of Mont Blanc~ and has been developing mountaineering equipment for over 150 years. Although is part of the Decathlon group~ the Simond team consists of 35 people~ who were born in the mountains or have made them their home~ features a rich diversity of origins and know-how: operators~ mounters~ machine-setters~ engineers~ designers~ sales people. Simond 2 in1 Mountaineering Glove has a preformed construction for hands and fingers enable precision ice axe or rope handling. Leather palm has leather reinforcements for extra durability when using ropes~ ice axes and ice screws. The manufacturer declares that the gloves are tested according to thermal test protocol and the following are the recommended and lower limit temperatures: From my personal experience~ I have never used these pair of gloves bellow -7°C and therefore I can not confirm if the recommended temperature by Simond is valid or not.   Fit & Comfort Simond 2 in1 Mountaineering Gloves are available in seven unisex sizes from XS to XXL. The inner glove and outer glove when worn together provide a close~ neat fit – although there is a small gap between the outer of the inner glove and the inside of the outer glove~ so the fit isn’t as close as gloves without removable liners. Wrist adjustment helps the fit in terms of staying in place on the hand. These gloves are very warm~ thanks to the extra synthetic insulation the liner gloves provide~ combined with the small air gap between liner and main glove. Also you can remove the liner glove to dry it more efficiently. The outer glove has stretch material on the back of the hand to allow more freedom of movement~ which helps comfort further. My only concern is the glove loop is only attached on the liner glove and therefore if you are distracted and you remove the outer layer of the glove it might drop down. One more concern I have is that when the gloved have been in used and if moisture has been accumulated between the hand and the liner~ it is difficult to remove both gloves at once. This is happening on most 2-in-1 gloves~ and is also the case on the Simond 2 in1 Mountaineering Gloves.  Performance and Details The Simond 2 in1 Mountaineering Glove although a great glove (for its price) in terms of actual use and performance can be a bit fiddly. If you intend to keep the glove on all day~ or most of the day it will be warm and functional. It is well made an keeps your hands warm and dry. But if you need to take off the glove to handle gear or kit it becomes more troublesome. The inner comes off to easily~ and as it is the inner that is attached to you wrists it’s far to easy to drop the outer glove. If you get the inner a little damp getting the glove back on was a pain as the outer glove has a thin liner which I found scrunched up making getting the inner back in fiddly. One more negative aspect of this glove is the binding clip that connects the two gloves. In my opinion is very small and not functional to clip/unclip~ especially if you have to do such operation during bad weather conditions. In the photo bellow~ you can see the binding clip.  For full review with many more photos feel free to see here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2018/02/22/simond-2-in-1-mountaineering-gloves-review/   .,Oct 2017,Feb 22 2018,1
4675,Simond 2-in-1 Mountaineering Gloves Review,1,1, They also do a cheaper version without removable insides~ which doesn't have that issue when taking it off. I have a much more expensive Black Diamond pair~ with removable inners. Just never really see the point in it. My waterproof gloves never get wet to the point that I need to take it apart to dry. (Softshell gloves do get soaked~ but are one piece.) When I need to feel things; I use the Simond sprint (softshell). Thin enough to feel and operate carabiners~ screws~ ice tools~ etc.  Use the little strap on the middle finger to attach it to your harness with a carabiner. With the bottom point to the ground~ snow doesn't fall in. The clip to join them together; never really get why you would need that~ other than to keep pairs together in storage.,Oct 2017,Feb 22 2018,0

4678,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,0, Totem Basics are virtually impossible to find right now so I ended up picking up a blue Revo Alien from Fixe to double up in this size. I was a bit worried to buy a Fixe cam after the Evo disaster~ but it looks like the Revo addresses many of the problems previously observed with Fixe cams. The trigger bar and stem components appear to all be made out of nice adonized aluminum now and the cam is certainly still quite light but also feels sturdy. Of note~ the Fixe Cam is actually narrower than the Totem Basic~ and not just due to differences on the end caps on the axle. I also noticed that the the endcap (not sure what the technical term here is) on one of the cams I looked at was not flush with the lobes~ I got the person in the shop to switch it out for another~ but if you buy online you may be subject to the larger manufacturing tolerances Fixe is known for.  Head width comparions  Also~ the Revo Aliens on paper are lighter and have equal or higher strength ratings as the Totem Basics. While the reported range of blue Totem Basic appears to be slightly smaller than the Fixe Revo~ without calipers I can't exactly compare them and they both seem to be about the same to me.  Fixe Revo Pros: Fixe Revo Cons: I need to go out and take some falls on the Fixe cam to convince myself that Fixe has fully fixed the problems with the their first round of Alien designs and that it's as durable as I hope it is but so far it looks like a well made unit and it may have some slight advantages over the Totem Basic.,Oct 2014,Jun 26 2017,0
4679,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,1, Is the bar that the trigger wires are attached to any thinner? I love my basics like any good MPer~ but the bar really gets in the way in a lot of good placements for the blue. So much so that I stopped carrying it and have doubled up on green c3s. ,Oct 2013,Jun 26 2017,0

I love my basics like any good MPer~ but the bar really gets in the way in a lot of good placements for the blue. So much so that I stopped carrying it and have doubled up on green c3s.  I don't think it's much thinner (it may be~ hard to tell without calipers) but it is tapered significantly unlike the rectangular bar on the Basic so its only the full thickness right at the stem. I've never had too much of an issue with the bar on the Basic getting in the way~ though maybe its a bit thinner now with how scraped up it is...,Oct 2014,Jun 26 2017,0
4681,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,3," It didn't bother me at first... I just had a ""moment"" on a climb where I was sorta cruxing and that damn bar kept catching~ keeping me from getting the upper lobes in a good spot. The constriction was sort of borderline nut/cam placement since the constriction was from the patina if that makes sense. After this I started carrying c3s and I just keep finding these perfect spots for the green where I know the basic would not work well and a nut might work~ but pluggin the c3 is so much faster. ",Oct 2013,Jun 26 2017,0
4682,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,4," I have a full set of Totem Basics and the Gray and Black Fixe Revos. I like the Revo better. The gray is narrower than even the much smaller green Basic:  And I like the molded thumb loop on the Revo over the unrefined cable pinch point on the inside of the Basic  Having said that~ the Black has the same ""defect"" mentioned above in that the end cap is not flush~ allowing the lobes to float on the axle a bit. And the springs are not internal on the black:  I don't know if the more floaty lobes as a result of the end cap are a feature. BD has stated that floaty lobes are intended in the Camalot design.",Oct 2007,Jun 26 2017,0
4683,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,5, Both the blue and black (I need to confirm this one) Revo Aliens now appear to have internal springs which is a big step up from the original Alien design in these sizes.  Nope~ the gap between the lobes is a dead give away. Internal spring means spring within the lobe~ not between lobes. The Fixe design is no different than a master cam in that regard. One of the positive (IMO) of the Basic is the switch from stiff wire to flexible wire on the lobes. That actually matters quite a bit in the smaller sizes as even a small lobe deformity tend to bind the wire~ preventing the lobe from retracting/expanding as freely: i.e. much easier for the cam to tract out of a placement.,Jul 2006,Jun 26 2017,0
4684,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,6, The blue most certainly has internal springs~ the lobes have been milled to accommodate the springs and essentially touch (hard to see in this photo because they only touch at the apex~ the outside lobes are the same width as the inside lobes where they touch the rock). The black as pointed out by the previous poster (who was fortunate enough to have the cam in front of them) may not have internal springs~ I have made the appropriate edits. They may appear to be similar~ but that's NOT internal spring (the BD X4 in the smaller sizes can be considered having internal springs). There is still a gap (that's more significant in the more open expansion range). Does it matter? Maybe not. Though internal spring still has a theoretical advantage when loaded on 2 lobes.,Jul 2006,Jun 26 2017,0
4685,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,7, They may appear to be similar~ but that's NOT internal spring (the BD X4 in the smaller sizes can be considered having internal springs). There is still a gap (that's more significant in the more open expansion range). Does it matter? Maybe not. Though internal spring still has a theoretical advantage when loaded on 2 lobes. I get what you are saying now and I'll make the appropriate changes. I fail to see what the theoretical advantage is in loading a cam rated to 5 or 6 kn on two lobes but I guess the bottomline is that the original Aliens got wider in the smaller sizes~ Fixe has partially fixed that problem~ at least when compared to the competition.,Oct 2014,Jun 26 2017,0
4686,Totem Basic vs. Fixe Revo Alien Comparison,1,8, I fail to see what the theoretical advantage is in loading a cam rated to 5 or 6 kn on two lobes With any gap between the only 2 loaded lobes the cam tends to rotate out of placement (the best would be 2 lobes directly opposing each other~ but that design has very limited range)~ though that probably shouldn't be an overriding concern when choosing a cam...,Jul 2006,Jun 26 2017,0

Kind of pricey and obviously don't want to throw money away for something that is getting torn up for climbing~ but just curious if anyone has tried these pants for offwidth and how they hold up compared to Carhartts? All heckling and comments from the peanut gallery are encouraged~ as is the standard.,Mar 2016,Jan 28 2018,0
4691,Arcteryx Tactical Pant for Offwidth?,1,1, I've worn them in the field and can say carharts would be better for what you want. They're materials are similar to crye pants and breathe well~ flex well~ but they'd be torn to shreds after a route or two,Nov 2010,Jan 30 2018,1

4694,Arcteryx Tactical Pant for Offwidth?,1,4," Work trousers are your best bet if you are climbing the size that needs tough trousers. If you want to pay the money I have found the arc'teryx gamma rock pants to be crazy tough for what they are really fantastically durable for how fine and breathable the fortius stuff is if you got them in the ""stingrey"" color they would even work well in the summer.",Oct 2015,Jan 30 2018,0
4695,Arcteryx Tactical Pant for Offwidth?,1,5, You should buy both pairs and cut the knees out of one pair. Sew the knee into the other knee and they will last four times as long! And you should still be able to sell the other pair to sport climbers who need to put knee pads on their knees. Unless of course they low ball you for your like new kneeless pants!  Arcteryx and offwidth don’t belong in the same sentence. It’s like saying dirtbag land rover. There’s surely a goodwill in your town...,Jan 2011,Jan 30 2018,2
4696,Arcteryx Tactical Pant for Offwidth?,1,6, Modern cammis have Velcro pockets which you can add knee pad sheets to. I know the digital and Multicam army ones have it~ not sure about the marine digis. Under $20 at a surplus store or eBay.,Oct 2015,Jan 30 2018,0

I know the digital and Multicam army ones have it~ not sure about the marine digis. Under $20 at a surplus store or eBay. There's no way ACUs would last either. The ass blows out after a week~ and they rip all the time. Its thin rip stop.

4701,Five Ten HiAngle,1,0," So I took advantage of the ridiculous sale going on and picked up a pair of Five Ten's HiAngles a few months back.  What I find interesting is that~ as is often the case~ Five Ten doesn't quite seem to know what they've made~ as evidenced by the disparity between 5.10's marketing and its actual use in the field.  When reading the description~ the company tends to focus on the shoe's comfort and stiffness and advocates it as a good ""first aggressive shoe~"" yet people have been sending ridiculously hard climbs in them~ and they've also become incredibly popular in the competition climbing circuit.  Ironically~ the HiAngle is starting to displace the Dragon and the Blackwing as 5.10's flagship aggressive shoe~ and has actually been more popular with high-end climbers: youtube.com/watch?v=Ip928VM… vimeo.com/199029223   The leather upper and slipper design let you downsize much more aggressively than with Five-Ten's other aggressive models (I literally couldn't get my foot into a pair of Blackwings that were a half size down from my normal street shoe size)~ so they're a great option if you have weird feet~ but expect a break-in period.     As far as performance~ I was a bit worried based on 5.10's description~ as I'm not a big fan of climbing in super stiff shoes (especially indoors)~ but I thankfully found 5.10's description off in this case.  They're stiff compared to Teams or Dragons (which isn't saying much)~ but still much softer than say a Miura VS~ and they especially feel great once you've gotten a few burns in and warmed up.  I'm a long-time Moccasym user~ and these honestly felt to me like a really aggressive~ downturned version of the Moccasym~ which makes for an awesome shoe IMO.  They have the same slipper-design and Stealth C4 Rubber (IMO~ the best climbing shoe rubber)~ but with a ton of extra power in the toes and a big patch of toe rubber on the top~ making them better for toe-hooking.  I'd still prefer something like a Team or a Solution if doing roof boulder problems~ but for hard sport climbing where you might need the occasional toe hook or bicycle~ they're excellent.  Climbing techy face or slab in them is about as fun as doing so in Solutions (not at all) and a waste of shoe~ but on the steeps~ these guys are fantastic.  For $80~ they're a no-brainer.",Jul 2014,Jan 19 2017,1
4702,Five Ten HiAngle,1,1, How does the sizing compare to the mocc?   And the toe box?,Apr 2013,Jan 20 2017,1
4703,Five Ten HiAngle,1,2, I have trouble resisting a good deal~ but i'm also completely happy with my shoes -- Muira Lace Ups.    I have low volume feet~ slight Morton's. After wearing the Muira laceups~ my old mythos and my daughter's Katanas feel like they're falling off my heels. I one tried on Solutions and didn't like the twisted foot feeling.    Do you have advice as to how I might like/dislike the HiAngles?    Also~ sizing compared to Muira? I already went to size squirrel and there are no comps.    Thank you!!,Jan 2014,Jan 20 2017,0
4704,Five Ten HiAngle,1,3,,Jan 2016,Jan 20 2017,0
4705,Five Ten HiAngle,1,4, When I ordered a pair of Hiangles they were apparently having inventory issues.  I instead picked up a pair of Evolv Nexco's for about $70~ which I could not be happier with.  They have an excellent toe patch for toe hooking~ an excellent heel for heel hooking~ they use the same kind of trick as the solutions to really get your foot to curve around as opposed to cramming them in the shoe~ and they broke in to be extremely comfortable for a downturned shoe.  I bought mine my street shoe size~ and though they killed my pinky toes the first few nights (they are a narrower shoe) they soon broke in.   It is also worth mentioning that I see a lot of climbers wearing both the Hiangle as well as the Nexco~ and I imagine this has more to do with the price of the shoes as opposed to their innate performance advantages.,Apr 2006,Jan 20 2017,0

4708,Five Ten HiAngle,1,7, Huh. How so?,Jul 2014,Apr 8 2017,0
4709,Five Ten HiAngle,1,8, I'm on my 3rd pair. they break in to ridiculous comfort levels for an aggressive shoe. Only issue is getting them on. If people weren't looking for that Butora sponsorship they might realize how good hiangles are.,Nov 2016,Apr 8 2017,0
4710,Five Ten HiAngle,1,9, Within two months: stitching on the inside of both shoes is significantly frayed~ two heel pull tabs ripped even after I sewed them~ velcro ripping off both straps~ stitching on the material that strap loops through is coming apart~ heel rubber delaminating~ toe rubber on top delaminating.  Since buying them~ I have met 3 people whose pairs have similar issues in similar time frames. I love 5.10 and have 5 other 5.10 shoes~ all 1-3 years old with multiple resoles and in fine condition. ,Dec 2012,Apr 8 2017,0
4711,Five Ten HiAngle,1,10, Wow~ that's nuts!  Definitely didn't have that happen.  I wore through to the rand a little sooner than I was hoping~ but definitely didn't have any of those problems.  Out of curiosity: do yours have the blue interior (and stain your feet blue) or grey?,Jul 2014,Apr 11 2017,0
4712,Five Ten HiAngle,1,11, Mine has the blue~ but two of the other bad pairs I've seen are grey.,Dec 2012,Apr 11 2017,0
4713,Five Ten HiAngle,1,12, I'm an 8 in moccs~ 8.5 in anasazi velcros~ 9.5 in Hi-angles (my tight pair is a 9).   ,Apr 2011,Apr 11 2017,0
4714,Five Ten HiAngle,1,13, My 1st pair of Hiangles (2017~ Grey) had both toes blow out in less than 10 weeks. My 2nd pair (2016~ smurf edition) had a pull tab fray and fall apart on the second use...(although they are sending me a new pair).,Jan 2016,May 3 2017,0
4715,Five Ten HiAngle,1,14, I ordered 9.5~ 10~ 10.5 and kept the 10's. I'm a street size ten. I typically size down on la sportiva a bit for tight fit. I couldnt size down much on these~ toes curled and the break in was long. I actually cut slits in the toe rubber to make more room for my toe knuckles. Blue does dye your foot but not as bad as my old rouges. I spend 50/50 time between these and solutions on hard stuff. For $80 was a great deal. Also~ I have no issues with durability in 5 months of climbing~ majority was indoor.,Mar 2015,May 31 2017,1
4716,Five Ten HiAngle,1,15, Does anyone have any size comparisons between the Team and the Hiangle?  I wear a 10 in the Hiangle and I'm trying to order a pair of Teams but I can't try them on anywhere near me.  Thanks.,Feb 2017,Jan 25 2018,0
4717,Five Ten HiAngle,1,16, I wear a half size down from street shoe on teams.  But I was 1.5 sizes down on hiangles,Dec 2012,Jan 29 2018,1
4718,Five Ten HiAngle,1,17, Similar story to mr. salad above~ my teams are 1 size bigger than my hiangles and they fit/feel about the same. I love the toe on the hiangle. It's very precise and the added stiffness gives it better edging power on tiny features over the team in steep terrain. The team is definitely softer and more sensitive and better for smedging.,Jan 2014,Jan 30 2018,0
4719,Five Ten HiAngle,1,18, One full size down from teams has worked well for me. ,Jul 2011,Feb 4 2018,0

4721,C4 & X4 Rust,1,0, Just picked up a set of 2014 c4s & x4s second hand but unused. The lobes still had fresh paint. But after a long climbing trip in the desert I washed the sand out of them with a little bit of dish soap. Rinsed~ dried and lubricanted with metoluis’ cam lube and stored in a cool dark closet.  Pulled them out to inspect them before a climbing trip and noticed rust on the axle pins. . Not sure if this is common.  Curious if anyone else has experienced a similar situation.  I find it curious because I have some old wild countries and rock centrics and not a hint of rust on them. They have also went thru the same cleaning process.,Jul 2017,Feb 3 2018,0

4724,C4 & X4 Rust,1,3, I left a couple cams clipped to my harness and accidentally left them in in a puddle for almost a week. my number one C4 had that same rust and I haven't noticed any negative effects from it.   And i think you're referring to annodizing.,Apr 2015,Feb 3 2018,1
4725,C4 & X4 Rust,1,4, A little rust on the axles is normal~ Stainless Steel is still prone to rust~ just more resistant than carbon steels. Make sure they are fully dry before you put them away next time.,Sep 2013,Feb 3 2018,1

4727,C4 & X4 Rust,1,6, I withstood a what felt like a full on river running over my gear while belaying in the middle of Chapel Pond Slab.  I cleaned and oiled my gear afterwards and still had a bit of rust show up on select pieces.  Before it gets bad you can work out most of the rust with lemon juice and a brillo.  ,Jul 2017,Feb 6 2018,1
4728,C4 & X4 Rust,1,7, Several cams that I have brought up alpine climbs have accrued a little bit of surface rust.  It's not really a concern for me.  ,Jun 2013,Feb 6 2018,0
4729,La Sportiva Trango Extreme Evo Light GTX – Mountaineering Boot Review,1,0, The La Sportiva Trango Extreme Evo boot is designed for the modern requirements of the alpinist: waterproof~ lightweight~ insulated~ high performance. The ideal balance for people who want a light boot suitable for crampons. Featuring the same abrasion resistant and waterproof Cordura®upper of the Trango S Evo~ and a Gore-Tex®/Duratherm® membrane~ that guarantees waterproofness and breathability~ combined with an antishock HP3 midsole. Suitable for alpinism~ ice climbing and hiking. The improved lacing system features a lace lock that allows double tension. Double rubber reinforcement on the toe box~ double density Vibram® sole – easy to resole.  Full review with many photos and details here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/la-sportiva-trango-extreme-evo-light-gtx-mountaineering-boot-review/  UPPER The Trango Extreme Evo Light GTX Boots by La Sportiva are technical mountaineering boots designed for the modern requirements of the alpinist~ ice climber~ and hiker: waterproof~ lightweight~ insulated~ high performance. The ideal balance for people who want a light boot suitable for crampons. The upper is using Water repellent Cordura® with hydro-treatment + Flex Tec 2. They are lightly insulated so I wouldn’t do serious winter climbs in them if there is any chance of an unplanned bivy. Lined with Gore-Tex Insulated Comfort. This means your feet will stay warm and dry and water cannot get inside. Though~ for the conditions of Greece (where I mostly climb)~ I believe is an ideal boot.  MIDSOLE~ OUTSOLE The mid-sole is made from EVA foam and compression-resistant Polyurethane. These shoes also come with an impact brake system for a better grip and nice cushioning – very comfortable especially when going downhill. With the climbing zone you will get on fine on the rock and the Crampons are perfect for alpine climbing. These boots have a    6-7 mm rigid HP3 midsole and can accommodate step-in (automatic) crampons which is perfect for any type of alpine and/or ice climbing. New exclusive sole with the innovative technology IBS (Impact Brake System)~ developed in collaboration with Vibram~ designed to soften impact on hard ground. The IBS (Impact Brake System) innovative system is applied to the sole to absorb negative ground impact~ help traction and improve grip downhill. Created and developed by the R&D department at La Sportiva~ it offers real advantages during racing by reducing negative ground impact. The unique position of the lugs allows as many of them as possible to come into contact with the ground~ for maximum impact absorption.  Warmth/Comfort/Performance These boots are really impressing. They fit perfectly and offer all-day comfort whether it be a 12 hour day climbing in Vardousia Mountains ~ or a single day ascent on Parnassos mountain. The boots are rather warm for the conditions in Greece~ though I have some concerns about the warmth for any winter climb in the Alps. The Vibram sole seems to give great grip on most surfaces and its stiffness is more than adequate when required to kick steps into bullet-hard snow. The sole is stiff  but walking comfort is not sacrificed~ something that is aided by the anti-shock midsole. Heel and toe welts enable full step-in (C3) crampons to be attached securely. The boot uppers are completely synthetic and they are remarkably tough; a friend of mine stumbled backwards and stood on my toe-box~ full force with his crampon.

4730,2017 Petzl Sirocco (and Barrabes),1,0, I just got two of Petzl's redesigned Sirocco. Here's some initial stuff. Using a high quality scale: My original Size 2 weighs 167g/5.9oz.  The new Size S/M weighs 161g/5.7oz The new Size M/L weighs 177g/6.2oz There is a marked difference in the helmet's profile. The new version sticks up off the top of my head significantly less~ and it will fit under a hood or into a chimney much better now:  I put a tape measure behind me~ hung on that line in the wood panel.  I didn't have an issue with the original Sirocco's durability~ but the new one has a hard shell over the crown. The back also now comes down farther on the back of your head.  A shout to Barrabes from Spain http://www.barrabes.world/ I ordered late on Thursday.

4734,2017 Petzl Sirocco (and Barrabes),1,4, With the level of insulation the helmet provides and all the ventilation there is likely to be little difference on the surface of your head. Possibly if you were not moving and there was no breeze you would detect a slight difference - Bedouins wearing loose black robes in the desert for instance~ are actually kept cooler - more shaded and cooled by convection. ,May 2014,Jun 29 2017,0

4746,2017 Petzl Sirocco (and Barrabes),1,16, It was slightly cheaper then. Not sure now with exchange rate fluctuations. I'm pretty sure white hasn't been widely released yet. FWIW~ I have found better or comparable prices at all the following overseas sites. I have personally ordered at least once from all of these site with no problems~ and I've placed several orders with many of them. Remember that any VAT is deducted from the price for shipping to the US~ and there is a $800 duty free limit. Also FWIW~ Petzl gear and Scarpa/Sportiva shoes are often much cheaper from Europe than here. Some sites have faster shipping than I've gotten stuff from US sites~ but as a general rule you should be a little patient with shipping times and communication. https://www.barrabes.world http://www.exxpozed.com/ https://www.trekkinn.com/ https://www.epictv.com/ http://www.outside.co.uk/ https://www.cham3s.com/en/ https://en.montbell.jp/ https://www.bergfreunde.eu/ ,Oct 2007,Jan 27 2018,0

4750,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,0, Last fall~ I posted here asking for opinions on double ropes.  I ended up buying Mammut’s Genesis doubles.  Now that I’ve been climbing on them for almost a year~ I figured it was a good time to report on my experiences with them.  Mammut Genesis doubles. A matched pair of Genesis ropes.   In my limited experience as a leader~ I’d been climbing exclusively on single ropes.  Two inciting incidents led me to consider doubles.  In the first~ I was leading a route called Peek-a-Boo at Table Rock in NC.  On the third pitch~ the combination of a meandering route and poor slinging of pro on my part put me in a situation of feeling like I was hauling a car up the cliff for the last few moves to the anchors.  In the second incident~ I was following a friend on Seconds at Laurel Knob; this friend leads almost exclusively on doubles~ and it was my first experience belaying with them.  The fact that working with the doubles was not nearly as complex as I’d feared~ along with finding out that the skinny ropes were not dangerous to rap on when soaked with water as we bailed out in a thunderstorm~ opened my eyes to the advantages of working with double ropes.   I’d heard good things about the Genesis ropes from people I know who climb regularly at the Gunks.  Also~ my first single rope was a Mammut~ which has held up very well.  So after weighing the helpful advice I got on MP~ I went with a pair of Genesis doubles. Observations   I haven’t climbed exclusively on my Genesis ropes over the past year; using doubles for sport climbing or single-pitch trad where you’re not going to be belaying from the top usually isn’t worth the extra bother.  But I’ve been spending a higher percentage of my climbing time leading multi-pitch trad in North Carolina (and a recent week-long trip to the Gunks); and for that kind of climbing~ the more I use my Genesis doubles~ the more I love them.  They feel great in the hand~ they’re less effort to pull slack on for a clip~ and I almost never feel noticeable rope drag anymore.   I’ve never been a fan of fat ropes~ but the slenderness of the Genesis ropes was startling at first even for me.  At 8.5 mm~ they’re about 10% skinnier than my favorite single (an Edelweiss 9.7).  But having had the one prior experience climbing on doubles~ I felt confident I’d get used to the skinny ropes.   Right out of the bag~ I took the usual precautions in uncoiling the ropes bicycle-crank style to avoid kinks.  One I had them uncoiled~ I took the extra step of flaking each rope a couple of times to limber them up.  This also gave me a chance to see how the ropes feel.   Compared with my Edelweiss~ the Genesis ropes have a firmer~ more slippery (in a good way) feel to them.  The sheath feels tight and tough.  When brand new~ the ropes had that new rope stiffness~ but quickly limbered up after a few climbs.  As far as I’m concerned~ Bluewater ropes have the nicest handling characteristics~ a kind of buttery feel; but the Genesis are almost as good.   A snug~ well-dressed knot is important to me~ and I wondered how the doubles would be compared to my old Mammut single rope~ which has always felt a little like trying to tie a knot in a cable.  Fortunately~ the Genesis ropes hold knots very well~ whether for a harness tie-in or tying the two together for a rap.  Getting knots untied doesn’t take a lot of effort and cursing either.   Leading on the Genesis doubles is a joy.  It could just be my imagination~ but pulling up slack for a clip seems to take noticeably less effort.  Of course~ having two ropes tied into your harness (even skinny ones) is more weight than one single~ but I can’t tell any real difference in rope weight when I move up the rock (with my crowded and heavy rack~ the rope is probably the least of my weight concerns).   The different techniques involved in leading on double ropes took a little getting used to.  I would find myself at a pro placement thinking “clip blue or red~ which way am I going next?”  I probably crossed my ropes more than once (something to be avoided in doubles).  After a few leads~ though~ which rope to clip became fairly second-nature.  It’s very satisfying to look down and see your ropes in a nice parallel configuration~ several feet apart.  Robert makes the moves on P1 of CCK. My friend Robert leads P1 of CCK at the Gunks on Mammut Genesis doubles.   Bringing up a second (or even two seconds) on the Genesis doubles is especially nice.  I use the BD XP Guide for my belay device~ and with my single ropes~ using it in guide mode has sometimes made for a lot of effort feeding the rope through.  The Genesis ropes~ on the other hand~ feed effortlessly through the Guide~ while there’s still plenty of friction to hold a fall if necessary.   Another good thing about using doubles is having two ropes for a long rappel.  Of course~ you can do the same thing with two singles~ but that means either trailing a rope or climbing with it coiled on yours or your second’s back.  From first-hand experience with both of these methods~ I’d much rather get two ropes up to the top by climbing on them rather than hauling one of them.   Low impact force in a fall is another of the pluses with doubles.  The skinny ropes are very stretchy~ making for a more gradual dissipation of fall force; this not only makes for what should be a softer catch~ but less stress on the gear.  The downside of this springiness is that it gives the leader more of a chance at groundfall or hitting a ledge than on a single in the same fall.   So what’s it really like to fall on a Genesis rope?  My first-hand experience is limited~ having taken only one fairly short fall.  The scenario was one in which I’d just moved above my last placement~ so it was just barely below my feet~ and I was high enough on the rock that there was probably 60’ of rope out.  With slack and rope stretch~ I ended up maybe 12-15’ below where I started.   The catch was nice and gentle~ noticeably softer than on a single.  Whether it made any difference in the gear holding is impossible to know~ though in this case I doubt it would have ripped in a single-rope fall.  I’d placed a medium nut with a cam as a backup just below the nut (I knew I was making a crux move~ so I wanted some insurance); the nut held without a problem.   The only slight negative experience I’ve had with the Genesis is related to kinking~ not long after I started using them.  After a double-rope rappel at Looking Glass~ my partner and I were pulling the ropes; things got progressively more difficult until finally~ even with both of us putting full weight on the rope~ it wouldn’t move at all.  Luckily another climber was on the rock nearby and offered to clear the ropes for us; when she got down~ she informed us the rope had kinked on itself so much that a kink had gotten stuck at the rap rings.   As time went on~ I didn’t run into any more problems with kinking~ but the possibility had me very worried on another occasion at Looking Glass.  This time~ as I was preparing to rap~ I stupidly dropped my belay device and watched it tumble 400 feet to the ground.  Since I didn’t have a spare or the makings for a biner brake~ I used a double muenter to rap.  The rat’s nest this produced was almost beyond belief; I was sure we were looking at stuck ropes again (this time with no one around to rescue us).  Fortunately~ my partner rapping behind me on her ATC seemed to straighten things out on each of the raps~ and we had no problems pulling the ropes.  Based on this~ I assume any early kinking problem with the Genesis ropes is just a temporary one.   The durability of these ropes has definitely impressed me.  Granted~ I don’t climb on them every day~ but I’ve used them enough over the past year to expect some wear and tear.  Not so – the ropes look like new still.  There’s no sheath fuzzing or other wear that I can see~ and the ropes haven’t gotten that out-of-round feel that I’ve seen in other well-used ropes.  The only change I’ve noticed is that the middle marker is a little harder to find on the blue rope than it used to be.  I don’t know whether that’s because the marker is wearing off or because the ropes are dirty~ though I suspect it’s the latter – I haven’t washed them since I got them. To conclude:  I’m sold on the Mammut Genesis doubles.  I have to admit I’ve had hardly any experience with anything else for comparison~ but if you’re looking for a pair of doubles~ you can’t go wrong with these.   Since they’re a site sponsor~ I feel it’s only fair to mention that Bent Gate has a good deal on the Genesis ropes~ below the suggested $159 retail price. Pros ,Nov 2006,Oct 21 2007,0
4751,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,1, Nice review. I bought a set of Genesis ropes based on the discussions here back in January.

4752,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,2, saxfiend    I started using double ropes after discovering I could belay both daughters at the gym at the same time.   I was able to keep them both climbing on top rope at the same time.   This was done safely I mite add for those of you with no double rope experience.   This system then moved on to top roping outside and on to multi- pitch routes.   I have used this system now for over fifteen years and works as well now that they are grown women as it did when together they hit about 120.     Climbing with double ropes lets both followers climb at the same time. One climbers climbs ahead by twenty or so feet. Leaving any pro that is necessary for the third like on traverses.    Three can climb as fast as two and you have a extra pair of hands at the belay.,Sep 2007,Oct 22 2007,0
4753,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,3, Thanks for the informative and well written review!  As for the comparison between single and doubles when one falls while clipping~ the conclusions are right.  The actual distances~ as I see it~ are as follows.   Our climber's feet are 5 feet above the last pro.  Her tie-in points are likely higher~ say 8 feet.  On double ropes~ the fall would be 16 feet before stretch.  The rope would start stretching when she's 8 feet below the lower anchor.   With a single rope~ our climber needs to pull up 4 feet of slack to clip in two feet above her harness.  If she falls~ she falls 16+4=20 feet before stretch and ends 12 feet below the lower anchor.   The simple rule concerning falls on a single rope while clipping is that you fall twice the distance between your last piece of pro and the one you fail to clip.  This excludes stretch and extra slack~ as you point out.  The length of the fall does not depend on whether you clip above your head or at waist level~ though the chances of hitting the deck are higher if you clip above your head because you start lower and you fall the same distance; hence~ you end up lower.   Continuing the example~ if our climber on a single rope decided to wait until the new anchor is at her waist's level~ she'd still fall 10 feet below the previous anchor~ whereas with double ropes~ she can clip as soon as the new anchor is within reach~ and fall at most 8 feet below the lower anchor.   This suggests that with double ropes~ the usual warning against not clipping above one's head should be revised.  Of course~ this only applies when one clips the two ropes in alternation.,Feb 2006,Oct 22 2007,0

4759,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,9, My fiance bought the Genesis ropes about 8 months ago and at first I was a little scared about belaying with them (but not leading since they clip so smoothly~ ahhhhh)~ but it only took a couple times to get used to them. They're awesome for eliminating rope drag (if you can clip them right~ I have gotten them crossed) and they feed a lot better through the Guide in guide mode than two single ropes. The only time the thinness of the ropes bothers me is when the leader clips one rope into the first couple of pieces (if he's traversing for example) so if he falls~ it's only onto one incredibly skinny rope~ which can be tougher to catch than a single fatty rope. Rappeling is no problem with a backup and we haven't had any problems with twirly ropes (sometimes when belaying~ but no worse than our single) - but we do flake our ropes out at home after every climb~ taking care to smooth out the kinks.   Doubles are also great for protecting a second from a big swing on climbs that traverse (if you can). It can be a pain when seconding if the second rope runs around a corner or is clipped up high and to the side as you may have to flip that rope to keep it from dragging you off line while climbing. I had this problem seconding Blind Faith in Eldorado Canyon - left rope clipped into the the crux 10a crack the whole way and then he ran it out after the crack and clipped the right rope up high and to the right. The entire time I was trying to climb the crack I had to keep reaching out and flipping the right rope over the edge so that it wouldn't pull me off sideways............   Anyway~ enough babble~ we love our Genesis ropes!!,Mar 2005,Oct 23 2007,0

4761,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,11," I've been climbing on Mammut Genesis 8.5 doubles for almost 4 years.   I've had ""kinking"" problems a few times; once when I dropped my belay device and had to use a munter to belay my partner up and then again to rap down. That took a few long raps to clear out. Then another time~ after rapping down~ I saw that I was rapping with the ropes over the side of the belay device~ which twisted it horribly. Again that took a few long raps to clean out. And more recently~ I've been teaching some beginners how to flake and coil~ rap and pull~ and the rope has been getting twisted again~ I haven't figured out what's doing it yet. But for the most part~ the ropes have had no problems on their own.   As for falls~ it's hard to tell since it depends on so many factors~ so all I can really say is that they caught me. On the other side~ the rope has a lot of stretch~ so you've got to be careful belaying up seconds on climbs with low cruxes when you've got a full rope length out.    Overall I've been really happy with the ropes. I'll probably replace them next summer~ and if I do it will be another set of the Genesis.",Aug 2006,Oct 23 2007,0

4763,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,13, I haven't used doubles too much~ but~ here is my impression:   For leading~ they are great.  We used them on The Saber in RMNP~ a pretty long alpine climb that involves double rope raps to get down.  It was nice to go light and not have to trail a rope.  However~ I have to say that rapping on them was a little nerve-wracking for me.  It might be because I was unused to them~ but looking at those two skinny lines going over granite edges kinda made me nervous.  While on lead~ you have to break both of them to come out of the system~ on rappel~ it only takes one.  Even a small rock falling from high up~ displaced by the wind or rain would have really made our day bad.  My feelings about them might change in time if I used them more frequently.,Jan 2006,Nov 12 2007,0
4764,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,14, Great review~ John!  I have a fair bit of experience using doubles~ and in all honesty~ I'm not a huge fan.  First and foremost~ I don't like all the mucky muck of two cords at belays.  Tangles are almost guaranteed.  The other gripe I have is the price.  You're looking at what~ $300 retail for a double rope rig~ right?  For that price~ I could buy a sweet 9.2~ plus a 7mil tag line~ and still have enough for dinner and drinks at the Mountain Room!  Lastly~ thin ropes wear out very quickly.  With moderate to heavy use~ your double rope setup will last 6 months to a year before needing to be replaced.  My unsolicited advice is to stick with a single cord~ manage rope drag with prudent use of slings~ and carry a lightweight tag line for your double-rope raps.,Jan 2002,Nov 12 2007,0

4769,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,1,19, I know this is an old thread~ but I thought I'd share an experience.  About a year ago I took a 20-25 foot fall onto a 00 TCU while climbing on these ropes.  Given that 00 TCU's are only rated to 3kN~ I feel it's likely that the same fall on a single rope would have generated enough force to cause the piece to fail.  I was caught by just one of the ropes.,Jun 2012,Oct 14 2012,0

4771,Gear Review - Mammut Genesis Double Ropes,2,0, Double ropes or an 80M allow you to rap down to the top of P1 Jim Dandy from top of P2 Peek-a-boo~ avoiding the P3 all together.  You can also rap down to top of P2 Jim Dandy and then continue onto Lunch Ledge and up from there. 70M works for this~ I think a 60M would too. ,Sep 2016,Jan 23 2018,0

4780,ALTITUDE PETZL HARNESS,1,8, Recently~ I have decided to upgrade some of my older pieces of equipment~ and during this process I came to the conclusion that I wanted to upgrade my harness system too.

4788,Petzl GriGri+ Review,1,6, Technology is progress real quick even in rock climbing equipments. No doubt grigri is a good belay device. I owned a first generation grigri.  It could be dangerous for beginners not in terms of safe but the lost of knowledge of using a ‘traditional’ belay devices. I noticed in forums there’s many questions were asked like:  1. How to use an ATC belay device  2. How to abseil with ATC  3. How to top belay with ATC & etc  grigri indeed a very convenient device but less versatile compared to a more traditional devices like figure 8~ ATC & etc. When I climb with newer climbers I’ll make it a point that they start with ATC before using a grigri. I do not wish the newer generation of climbers lost the essence of how to operate a basic belay device.  Just sharing my thoughts.,Dec 2017,Jan 22 2018,1

4790,Custom Toyota Chinook,1,0, I wanted to show off a few pictures of my truck and see what else people are doing for their climbing rigs. Let's see those covered wagons!  Quarter view of my truck Its a 1985 4x4 Turbo Diesel Toyota longbed that has been converted into a camper by removing the bed and the addition of the pop-top camper off of a 1978 Toyota Chinook. This mod will work on just about any pick-up with the right wheel-base and cab height. All you need is to find an old Chinook~ then take off the camper and then line everything up. I've seen old Chinooks for as little as 500$ on Craigslist.  A particularly stylish old Toyota Chinook   The rear glass and entire rear has been removed from the cab thanks to a Sawzall~ permitting a pass through. Most of this work mating the two major parts was done by a friend in Calgary. The entire truck was rebuilt from front to back...new exhaust~ overhauled drive train and drive line~ overhauled axels~ beefed up brakes~ rebuilt turbo and motor including a new head and rings....you name it... its either rebuilt or new. All work done by Toyota with Toyota parts. 4 inch suspension lift with pro-comp gas shocks and add a leaf in the rear for heavy loads. It all rides on 385/75 Goodyear Duratracs on 16 inch alloy rims. Custom welding of bumpers and sliders done by the same friend in Calgary. The paint is a two part epoxy~ the same they use to paint offshore oil rigs. The hood is flat black for glare reduction and its got 65% tint all around on the windows. The Canvas on the pop-top is in great shape and the camper shell itself is great~ Chinook made those things bomber!  There were a few important mods that were needed to improve the structural joining of the cab and camper....I can detail if any one is interested. I have about a total of 18k invested~ not including my time.  Side view of my truck    With the diesel~ I average 20-22 mpg on the highway. I must say it is pretty gutless~ so I don't try and win any races. You'll usually find me camped out in the right lane~ sorry in advance if you're behind me on a big hill : ) It does however have plenty of low-end torque for rolling over shit that gets in the way.   I don't have any of the finished interior photos~ but I'll post up when I get a chance. There's a three way fridge inside that runs off 220v/12v/Gas... It gets cold enough to keep the Mr Freeze pops frozen and it will run off a single 20gal gas cylinder for two weeks. I have the sink~ two burner stove and an 80 litre water tank as well. All the surface appliances are recessed into the counter with covers so that I have lots of counter space when I need it. All the electrical system in the back as well as the stereo is run off a separate deep cycle battery that is hooked up to a battery isolator off of the alternator. There is a 600w inverter for powering computers etc... It has tons of closet and storage space and there is a couch that folds out into a bed with space for two and my big dog.   Future projects/dreams include air-bags for the rear suspension~ solar panels and satellite internet for when I'm using it for work.

4801,BD Aspect Rock Shoe,1,2, They are very stiff and precise. I would give the edge to the TC for the P3 but only barely. Really liked them for the brief period I tried them out. Sized a half a size down and it was nice and tight. ,unknown,Jan 11 2018,0
4802,BD Aspect Rock Shoe,1,3, I have tried them on - they didn't fit my feet. I usually wear 5.10s or Scarpas. I usually wear 5.10s and scarpas as well and I thought they fit perfectly. Sized 0.5 us down.,Sep 2013,Jan 11 2018,0
4803,BD Aspect Rock Shoe,1,4, I tried these before giving up and going on to the TC Pros. I wanted to love them~ but they were so incredibly narrow in the front end of the shoe~ with an increasingly-larger gap in the heel cup the higher up I sized~ which felt a little awkward for my foot shape. Never have had to size up so much... if I had been able to find the half size larger I might have liked them~ but they weren't available in store so I just went with the TCs (which I friggin love). Also found the Aspects somewhat difficult to adjust~ despite the laces.,Jan 2017,Jan 12 2018,1
4804,BD Aspect Rock Shoe,1,5, I have been using them since my TC Pro’s are getting a resole. Stiff initially~ really stiff actually. After a good break in they are doing great on slab and edging around San Diego and Suicide. Went and did Open Book and a few cracks on suicide and J-Tree and they’ve kicked ass. Not as comfortable as TC Pro’s for all day multi-pitch but for single pitch they rock.,Oct 2015,Jan 12 2018,0
4805,Five Ten ANASAZI GUIDE Climbing Shoe Review,1,0, Check out the review on my website here!  Background: Being a mostly trad climber~ I often find my self wedging my foot into cracks of varying sizes and using very thin feet. I prefer shoes that are thin enough to fit the toe into finger cracks and have a good enough edge to smear and make the tiniest of rock good enough for a foot.  Five Ten has a bunch of shoes under the Anasazi name. For instance~ the Anasazi Blanco (just a more aggressive but still moderate version of the Guides)~ the Anasazi VCS (velcro shoe) and the ultra classic Anasazi Moccasym (classic slipper style shoe). The Anasazi line is basically full of moderate to neutral shoes with their signature C4 rubber that are great for crack and sport climbing.  Initial Thoughts: I found the Anasazi Guides for $74 (originally priced at $145 i believe). Now for $74~ I honestly wasn't expecting much. Right out of the box~ I noticed the toe of the shoe was quite big. Ive had a couple other Five Ten Anasazis. The latest pair Ive owned were the Moccasyms which have a fairly average toe. Comparing the Guides to the Moccasyms you would notice the toe on the Guides is extremely bigger. Another thing about the Guides is the angle of down turn (non existent.) Now I didn’t purchase the shoe thinking it would be the most aggressive shoe out~ but putting the shoe on a flat surface~ the toe literally goes up.  Use: With the Five Ten Anasazi Guides sporting a toe larger than a giants~ you won’t be squeezing it in finger cracks any time soon. Another down side to the large boxy toe is that you won’t get the high sensitivity that other climbing type specific shoes offer. With that being said~ the Anasazi Guides are best used for crack climbing when the cracks are hands to fist. Anything below that size~ I couldn’t imagine fitting my toe in. They seem to also hold their own for casual sport climbs as well as longer climbs without too much technical foot work.  Pros:  Cons: ,Feb 2016,Dec 3 2017,2

4807,layering advice: arcteryx gamma lt vs arcteryx proton lt as a 2nd mid layer,1,0, I do not have any softshell yet and think its past time I get one. I like the sound of the proton lt and gamma lt or bd dawn patrol. I dont have any good outdoors stores near me so havent been able to get my hands on any. So I was wondering what the differences are? (which is warmer~ more breathable~ more durable~ more useful) and which would you prefer for mountaineering in the pacific nw? I would layer over a tnf fleece (similar to pata R1) and a lightweight synthetic baselayer. I would also like to use for ski touring.,Jul 2017,Dec 27 2017,0
4808,layering advice: arcteryx gamma lt vs arcteryx proton lt as a 2nd mid layer,1,1," I think you need to be more specific when you say~ ""mountaineering."" What exactly are you planning on doing ... technical climbing on rock and/or ice?  Glacier travel to volcanic routes? You've listed the Gamma LT and the Proton LT.  They are two completely different jackets.   The Gamma LT is a traditional~ uninsulated softshell hooded jacket.  It is very durable~ stretchy and comfortable with an amazing hood that will accommodate a climbing & ski helmet with ease.  The Gamma LT Hoody will breath pretty well and offer you decent wind/weather protection. Nothing cutting edge here~ but sometimes that's exactly what a mission calls for. The Proton LT Hoody is not a traditional softshell jacket~ even though I think I've read somewhere Arc'teryx may refer to it as such.  The Proton LT Hoody has a light~ nylon face fabric that is wind and weather resistant.  The Proton LT Hoody is filled with 65 g/m2 of CoreLoft Continuous synthetic insulation.  CoreLoft Continuous is Arc'teryx's entry into the breathable insulation game; competing with Patagonia's FullRange active insulation~ Polartec's Alpha insulation and other offerings from PrimaLoft.  I own the Gamma LT Hoody and the Proton LT Hoody.  I don't wear both combined as the Proton LT Hoody was designed to be worn on its own.  It is wind/weather resistant enough on its own that it doesn't really work very well as a midlayer all the time.  If wind/snow/weather are too much~ then a lightweight hardshell~ like an Alpha FL~ Westcomb Shift LT Hoody~ etc. should be worn.  Keep in mind~ a lightweight hardshell will weigh a lot less and be a lot more packable than the Gamma LT Hoody.  Even though ""LT"" is in the title~ it's nowhere near as lightweight or packable as a hardshell. I've found that the Proton LT Hoody does very well on its own and I rarely~ if ever~ have to couple it with a hardshell~ even though I always have my Alpha FL in my pack.  The Proton LT Hoody blocks most wind/precipitation and dries reasonably fast.  If you're looking for a synthetic midlayer with active insulation~ I also recommend Patagonia's Nano-Air series.  I have the Nano-Air Light Hoody and the original Nano-Air Jacket.  I find the face fabric the Nano-Air breathes better than the Proton LT Hoody~ but isn't as wind/weather resistant~ which makes it a better midlayer under a softshell/hardshell when you'll be wearing the shell all day.  Keep in mind though~ all these active insulation pieces were really designed to be worn on their own so they can breath as intended.  The Nano-Air series dries faster than the Proton series in my experience. On that note~ your layering system sounds like a bit much~ unless you run very cold.  A thin baselayer & fleece layer~ coupled with an active insulation piece and a softshell or hardshell is a lot~ unless you run super~ super cold.  Odds are~ you'll overheat three minutes into the approach.  With a little more information on what ""mountaineering"" really means~ I can help recommend a layering system with the aforementioned apparel. ",Mar 2011,Dec 27 2017,1
4809,layering advice: arcteryx gamma lt vs arcteryx proton lt as a 2nd mid layer,1,2, Thanks for the quick advice Alpine Ice Mountaineering for me is glacier travel on volcanic routes and planning on getting into some more technical routes with mixed climbing. I'd like to take some combination of this system to bigger peaks some day. I run pretty warm so would a system without a fleece layer (base layer~ active insulation~ shell) be more effective for the dc route mt rainier for example? Planning on giving it a go mid summer. I have the alpha AR now~ are you saying it could go well with the nano-air series or atom lt? ,Jul 2017,Dec 27 2017,0
4810,layering advice: arcteryx gamma lt vs arcteryx proton lt as a 2nd mid layer,1,3," I've never been up on Rainier~ but slogging up hill for a few days makes one think that you'll work up a sweat and stay pretty warm most of the day.  I know Liberty Ridge is one of the more technical routes on the mountain~ which would warrant little more thought and practice with your apparel system due to belays~ etc.  That being said~ I don't want to give you advice on a layering system of for a mountain I've never set foot on.  there's probably a hundreds of people on MP that have climbed Rainier and can better guide you on what they wore. This is my advice and take it for what it's worth - I think people mistakenly think the base of their climbing apparel is their technical hardshell.  When's the last time anyone wore a hardshell and though to themselves~ ""Man~ this thing is so comfortable!""  The truth is~ they're waterproof~ but not breathable.  Unless you're actually technically climbing some WI 4 or higher at elevation~ a hardshell is pretty worthless as most people over heat within ten minutes of slogging up hill.  An ultra lightweight hardshell is a great piece of gear to have if it's balls cold and windy or climbing waterfall ice with nasty~ drippy conditions. I think~ with the advent of active insulation~ that's where your concentration should be and where the foundation of your layering system should start.  For me~ a super thin baselayer (Cap 1)~ a Nano-Air Light Hoody~ which uses 40 g/m2 of FullRange insulation and a Proton LT Hoody with 65 g/m2 CoreLoft Continuous has gotten me pretty far in some very~ very cold weather.  Add a hardshell if weather/wind warrant it and a thick belay jacket to top it all off. I live/climb in the northeast where it hasn't been much above 0ºF the past week.  Winters can be very~ very cold with a lot of lake-effect snow.  I've found that active insulation does work pretty well as described.  The light and airy face fabrics~ coupled with the porous insulation allows decent venting while I'm climbing.  The face fabrics dry really fast~ even in severe cold~ which allows me to wear them without a hardshell ninety-one percent of the time. Your needs may very~ but it gives you a starting point.  If you're looking for a really good midlayer and you run on the warmer side~ I'd choose the Nano-Air Light Hoody over the Atom LT Hoody.  For a little more warmth~ check out the Nano-Air Hoody.",Mar 2011,Dec 29 2017,1
4811,layering advice: arcteryx gamma lt vs arcteryx proton lt as a 2nd mid layer,1,4, thanks mate  I think I'll start looking for the nano air. I'm looking for something to wear as an outer layer most of the time until the conditions worsen so I would want it to be more protective than the nano air light. Is it true the newer version has a 30D nylon shell? I'm thinking that might be more what I'm looking for as it should show less signs of wear and may last a bit longer. How's my thinking process here? ,Jul 2017,Jan 2 2018,0
4812,layering advice: arcteryx gamma lt vs arcteryx proton lt as a 2nd mid layer,1,5, For your outer-most layer~ I'd go with (and I did) the Proton LT Hoody.  It's a bit more weather/wind resistant and adds in the durability~ over the Nano-Air series~ you're seeking.  I'm not sure about the newest Nano-Air face fabric.  My Nano-Air Light Hoody & Nano-Air Jacket are last year's models. ,Mar 2011,Jan 2 2018,0

4822,Ice Tool advice,1,0, I'm looking at getting into Ice this season~ last season I used my fiends set of BD Viper~ while my friend did study abroad~ and I got hooked on Ice. So this season I want to get my own tools~ so I don't have to steal his.   I will be climbing in the New England area~ Mostly in the Greens in Vermont~ and doing WI2-WI4 most the time~ and maybe a few Alpine runs on Mansfield~ Washington or Katadhin this winter. I am not at that point where I think Mixed is in my ability range~ so I'm looking at Ice specific~ but can do some alpine.   I don't mind spending more for a tool which will last longer. I would like something to grow with and learn on~ but I can also do some of the crazy stuff later.   Right now I'm looking at...   Petzl Quark   Cassin X-All Mountain   BD Cobra   Trango Raptor    Grivel Quantum Tech    Also what is the consensus on buying used ice tools? Is that bad Juju or is it not a problem?   If you have any experience or pointers and advice you can give me~ I would greatly appreciate it!,Oct 2015,Oct 24 2015,0
4823,Ice Tool advice,1,1, Used tools are fine.   I think the best tools for strictly waterfall ice (not mixed) are the BD Cobras.  I also think the Quarks are great too.   Read a pretty amazing review on the X All Mountains though~ at least as far as thin ice is concerned.   I just bought the BD Fuel~ excited to try them out.,May 2010,Oct 24 2015,0
4824,Ice Tool advice,1,2, Try and get your hands on every tool in your list and see what works well for you. I think you'll find that Cassin tools displace the least ice and clean the easiest.     Used tools can be a good deal.    As far as advice~ learn good technique from a mentor or guide.,Jul 2012,Oct 24 2015,1

4829,Ice Tool advice,1,7, Honestly~ if you don't have the opportunity to try before you buy~ just buy whatever is cheap. Seriously.  Then you can sell them down the road without losing too much money if you decide you want to try something different.   I've owned: Petzl Nomics~ Ergos~ and Quarks~ BD Cobras and Vipers~ Grivel Quantum Tech~ Matrix Tech~ X-Monster~ Force Alloy~ Taakoon~ Cassin X-All Mountain and X-Dream~ DMM Fly~ and Trango Raptor 2.     I've liked them all - they were all fine. I could probably have done my hardest ice leads with any single tool on that list (except for the DMM Fly~ but that's obvious).  Some maybe have a tiny edge over the others in specific scenarios~ but the truth is~ nobody makes a bad ice axe anymore.  It's all personal preference.,Nov 2009,Oct 24 2015,1
4830,Ice Tool advice,1,8," I wrote this short comparison 3 years ago and I'm pasting it here~ although I should update it one of these days.  For reference~ I've been climbing ice for 8 years~ climbing in general for 15 years~ and I'm 6'2"" and 185 lbs. Typically lead WI 5 or 5+~ M6-7.  I've followed WI6~ M9.   The 2 main tools that are missing from the review are the X-Dream and the Trango Raptor.  I'll get around to them sooner or later. Suffice it to say~ those are the 2 pairs of tools I own right now~ with no plans to sell either set.   --------------------------   BD COBRA   One of my favorite all around tools~ especially for alpinism. Only sold it because matching on the upper grip causes pick shift which is kinda scary~ especially when you're run out. Took it to Chamonix for 3 weeks and was happy with my choice~ especially with a set of Aermet picks.   BD VIPER   Like the Cobra but a bit clunkier~ heavier~ and not as well damped on vibration. Cheaper though.   PETZL NOMIC   Currently have a pair. Great for mixed climbing and even drytooling. Not crazy about them for pure ice~ even steep 5+ waterfalls. I find the pick angle too aggressive and rarely get first-swing sticks. This applies across the board using Ice~ Dry~ and older Cascade picks.   PETZL QUARKS (2nd gen)   Didn't like them at all. Very light~ great all around tool~ but uncomfortable for my hand~ hated the ""trigger"" and bashed my knuckles more than any other tool. Sold them off after 3-4 days.   PETZL ERGO   Too Ergo for me. Took them to Ouray and up routes like Tic Tac (M6/7) and Seamstress (M8) and the angle was just too aggressive for me. Almost a full ""C"" shape. They would probably be ideal for pulling through tiered roofs where you have an unstable~ blind hook each time you need to pull through~ but for consistent 10-deg-past-vertical walls they were a bit awkward. This tool personified the ""more is not always better"" axiom~ at least with regards to ice tool geometry aggressiveness. Stronger climbers (like local NE hardman PCooke who bought them from me) may disagree.   BD FUSION   Mediocre on ice - pick is too steep. Forces you to ""chop"" unnaturally at the ice in a downward angle instead of swinging in to it horizontally. Great at mixed routes with minimal/thin ice that warrants gentle taps. Even better drytooling/hooking/torquing. Comfortable handle. Haven't had a chance to try out the ""Fusion Ice"" pick yet so can't comment on that~ but I've heard good things.   GRIVEL QUANTUM TECH   My favorite pure ice tool ever. Light~ balanced~ first-swing sticks almost every single time. Love the picks too - Grivel has the best metallurgy I've yet to encounter. Only complaint is ""perceived"" fragility - I'm not 100% comfortable torquing on them or even worse~ torquing the shaft in a crack. Also it has a poor upper ""shelf"" for matching but that can be easily fixed with some MacGyver skills. The pinky hook could stand to be a bit bigger (larger radius~ to be specific) as well - can be uncomfortable for those with big hands (i.e. me). The inside presses uncomfortably on my pinky knuckles.   GRIVEL FORCE (Carbon)   Drytooling beast. Climbs like nothing else I've ever used. Would hate to have to climb much ice though. It hooks way better than it swings.    GRIVEL MASTER (Alloy)   Great all around tool if you focus on harder ice/mixed routes. Lots of bling factor and gets a lot of attention at the crag if you're into that sort of thing.  Don't bother with it if you max out around WI4.  Wish the head had some more weight. Feels very balanced in the hand and is very comfortable to hook~ but the swing was tough for me to get right consistently.  Not good for very cold weather - my hands are too big to fit in the fixed-size upper pinky shelf if I'm wearing my thickest gloves.   CONCLUSIONS   It's easy to find a tool to fit a single niche. I'm still loving my Quantums for pure ice and pretty happy with the Nomics for mixed. I have yet to find an ice tool that I truly love for alpine use. If I was going to Chamonix or Canmore tomorrow I would probably take Quantums. Nomics if it was a thin season or objectively knew there would be substantial mixed sections on the routes we're aiming for.   If they could fix the pick shift on the Cobras it would be a one-tool quiver~ but that would take a heavy redesign and it would no longer be the Cobra.   For HARD drytooling~ get the Grivel Force (Carbon or Alloy) if you've got the coin~ otherwise you'll still be very happy with Fusions or Nomics. There are some efficiencies to be gained if your tools share the same pick system. I personally prefer BD picks attachment style (and hate Petzl's) but the Petzl picks generally win overall~ so I've got Nomics. The new BD Fuels are interesting and could bring me back to BD if they get it right.   CONCLUSIONS UPDATED FOR 2015/2016   I do 90% of my climbing on X-Dreams.  Love them.  Never had so many one-swing sticks. This is my favorite all around tool I've ever climbed on. Their picks have lovely geometry~ but soft~ shitty steel.  CAMP claims that the softer steel is ""stickier"" and thus more secure on mixed/dry moves~ but they don't feel any more secure to me than Petzl or Grivel steel which lasts WAY longer.  Luckily~ CAMP picks are a good deal cheaper than any of the competitors~ so it balances out.   I would take X-Dreams pretty much anywhere short of a mellow alpine trip or ski mountaineering. Cham~ Canmore~ Cody~ Hyalite~ or Ouray... X-dreams would be my choice.  Going to climb Liberty Ridge on Rainier.... probably the brand new black BD Vipers.",Nov 2009,Oct 24 2015,2
4831,Ice Tool advice,1,9, The OP list is pretty complete~ if you can try out the tools first you'll be better off. I climb water ice on Nomics~ my wife climbs on Quarks. I personally don't like the Quarks for water ice but they are very flexible and great for alpine ice. She likes them fine and follows WI5 on them. I think Petzl does the best job producing a family of tools that interchange parts for multiple purposes. In general I just like Petzl's ice and alpine gear as a whole.,Jul 2010,Oct 24 2015,0
4832,Ice Tool advice,1,10, Next time you're in the GUNKS stop by the Rock and snow annex. They can have some killer deals. Picked up an awesome pair of reactors there which have served me very well,Apr 2012,Oct 24 2015,0
4833,Ice Tool advice,1,11, Used tools are fine.   The ones you listed are all great tools. But they have really different swings. If you have the patience~ try as many out as you can and see what feels most natural to you. Still~ if you end up buying any of them you'll learn the swing and will probably end up happy.,Feb 2011,Oct 26 2015,0
4834,Ice Tool advice,1,12, Excellent advice in this thread. Try a ton~ then buy. Used is totally fine.   Also noticed that all of your listed tools (it's a good list) are straight handled. While there is an advantage for straight handles in the alpine (so you can plunge the shaft)~ there really isn't an advantage on actual waterfall ice. Many prefer offset handled tools for actual ice (including myself).   If I were you~ I would consider adding the Petzl Nomic~ Cassin X-Dream~ BD Fuel~ and other similar tools to your list.   Honestly~ for pure ice~ it's hard to beat Nomics~ X-Dreams~ or Cobras (in no particular order).   Edit to add: DON'T GET AN ADZE. Seems like everyone makes this mistake on their first pair of technical tools. In 2015~ you will be far more likely to give yourself a good sized face scar than chop a step. Hammers (or nothing~ depending on the tool) for both tools. MAYBE an adze if you are doing a lot of serious alpine.,Aug 2010,Nov 2 2015,0

4836,Ice Tool advice,1,14, I'm of the opinion that you really can't go wrong with any of the tools on your list~ and I have climbed on most of them.  I climb on Cassin X-Alls and I love them... One swing sticks almost every time.  Cassin picks are cheap to replace and don't displace much ice~ which is a big plus.  I recommend looking at them or Cassin X-Dreams.   If you are planning on mostly moderate (WI3-4~ M3-5) alpine stuff~ I highly recommend BD Cobras or Cassin X-All Mountains.  If you have your eye on WI5~ get the X-Dreams.   And skip the Quarks~ I don't know anyone who likes them when compared to other tools.,Jun 2013,Nov 2 2015,0
4837,Ice Tool advice,1,15, All modern tools will be fine. Some perform slightly better than others. In fact~ the I picked up a set of Monsters brand new for $109 shipped while waiting for a good deal on Quantum Techs and while they don't feel quite as nice as QT or Cobras~ they were absolutely fine and I expect to continue using them.    Before I decided on Quantum Techs I used everything and to me the Quantums are the best pure ice tool. The swings just feel good. I was talking with a partner about this and I said~ it's not something you can explain~ it just has this nice secure solid first stick feel that only the Cobra came close to matching. Grivel picks are really durable. I've had the same set on my Monsters for 1.5 seasons and expect to get another season out of them (they share the same pick as the QT/Matrix).    I also really liked the Cobra but the picks seemed to stick a lot. And most of my partners with BD picks complain about them. So I crossed those off my list. I'm sure you can modify the pick aggressively for it to clean better.    Basically~ I agree with the guy that said get whatever is cheapest and sell it if you don't like it or think it's holding you back.,Dec 2009,Nov 4 2015,0

If you can get the weekend of Feb. 5-7 (Friday-Sunday) off~ go to the Mount Washington Valley Ice Fest  in/around North Conway~ NH.  You should be able to demo every tool on your list~ with the likely exception of the Trango Raptors (Trango is not listed on the MWVIF site) and the possible exception of the Quantum Techs (Grivel might be pushing their new Machine line).  You could probably sell your old tools to someone at the Ice Fest as well.   If only we had one of these in the PNW....,Jun 2011,Nov 4 2015,0

4847,Ice Tool advice,2,4, Hey guys. Reviving this thread to ask about buying new tools. I’m going to be taking a course on mixed climbing next season and I’m currently thinking about what tools to save up for. I don’t really see myself climbing a whole lot of waterfall ice in the future but I’m more interested in doing couloirs and mixed routes up and down the alps. For most people seeking advice on the topic it seems to be the other way round~ hence my asking. This far I’ve been looking at the usual suspects such as the BD Vipers and DMM Apex. Both of which have a straight grip rather than an ergonomic one. They look more basic than let’s say Petzl Nomics or DMM Switches and seem more suited for a beginner such as myself. Is that conclusion accurate? I wouldn’t want to over-do it with some extreme mixed tools being a total noob. especially if for example the Vipers will do just fine even if used on mixed routes most of the time. But I’m also thinking that it might make more sense to buy a dedicated mixed tool if mixed is what I plan on doing mostly and also keeping in mind that the tools should work fine in a few seasons when ambitions and skills advance. Do you guys have any recommendations on what to get?,Feb 2017,Dec 22 2017,0
4848,Ice Tool advice,2,5, Hey guys. Reviving this thread to ask about buying new tools. I’m going to be taking a course on mixed climbing next season and I’m currently thinking about what tools to save up for. I don’t really see myself climbing a whole lot of waterfall ice in the future but I’m more interested in doing couloirs and mixed routes up and down the alps. For most people seeking advice on the topic it seems to be the other way round~ hence my asking. This far I’ve been looking at the usual suspects such as the BD Vipers and DMM Apex. Both of which have a straight grip rather than an ergonomic one. They look more basic than let’s say Petzl Nomics or DMM Switches and seem more suited for a beginner such as myself. Is that conclusion accurate? I wouldn’t want to over-do it with some extreme mixed tools being a total noob. especially if for example the Vipers will do just fine even if used on mixed routes most of the time. But I’m also thinking that it might make more sense to buy a dedicated mixed tool if mixed is what I plan on doing mostly and also keeping in mind that the tools should work fine in a few seasons when ambitions and skills advance. Do you guys have any recommendations on what to get? I have both vipers and switches. I got the switches specifically for mixed Climbing as they are super burly and every time I would try to match on a single viper~ it’d pop off (hence the name switches). I like them. Very well made like all DMM gear. I’m probably more in the noob category myself when it comes to mixed but that’s been my experience ,Aug 2014,Dec 22 2017,0
4849,Ice Tool advice,2,6, Have both BD vipers and fusions. I swapped out the original fusion picks for the fusion ice pick and love it. When it comes to alpine or snow/ice climbing~ I’m sticking with the vipers~ as it’s easier with the adze. The fusions are pretty much a mixed/cragging tool (ice park~ one pitch etc). Bought both sets used and with care they’ve done me well. ,Jul 2009,Dec 22 2017,0

Do you guys have any recommendations on what to get?  If you’re taking a course they’ll be lots of tools around to try out. Courses usually have demos along with them or the company has loaner tools. The people taking courses are always friendly and will lend you their tools to try for a lap. The Guides should too. Try as many tools as you can during course. Get advice from the Guides teaching the course then make your decision. More than likely the course may offer a discount at a local retailer.,Jul 2012,Dec 23 2017,0

4855,ice climbing gloves for BIG HANDS,1,4, You know what they say~ big hands~ big feet...big shoes and gloves.    I wear a size 15 shoe and a XXL glove. Tracking down gear that fits is a constant pursuit. Shoes are typically too wide and gloves made for fat hands.    I have been pleased with CAMP gloves. I'm not an ice climber so I don't know about dry or durability but the ones I've used have fit well and been warm for my general outdoor use. I also found a pair of Mammut gloves in XXL recently~they were great on Rainier. Of course Hestra makes large gloves but they may not have anything geared for climbing. I search by size on Gear Trade to hunt bargains.   Hope that helps~ Will,Jan 2016,Dec 3 2016,0

4864,Cassin Eghen 22 Backpack Review,1,0, I can see why this won Editor's Choice this year! Over 1500 word review with pics here: https://northeastalpinestart.com/2017/11/30/gear-review-cassin-eghen-22-backpack/  ,Nov 2012,Nov 30 2017,3
4865,Cassin Eghen 22 Backpack Review,1,1,   Hmm. Wonder if he's sponsored by petzl :l...also i like the picture of him hiking into mt washington with a pack that's marketed to have all these features like multiple ways to carry a rope...yet rope is over his shoulders... Tons of packs have an assortment of features they're not always practical though. That being said I'm pretty critical of packs given that they can throw a bunch of marketing gimmicks into them as selling points but sometimes they just hinder the performance. Pockets that force you to load the pack away from your core and center of gravity for example which throws you off balance easily. Can't rag too much on this pack though as ive never tried a cassin pack on. Could be better than I'm making it out to be. Send me one cassin so I can try that baby out!,Sep 2017,Dec 6 2017,0
4866,Cassin Eghen 22 Backpack Review,1,2, Hmm. Wonder if he's sponsored by petzl  Too funny~ you look at a picture of a climber using non-Petzl tools~ non-Petzl 'pons~ a non-Petzl pack~ with a non-Petzl belay plate and you see a Petzl sponsored climber?

4868,Cassin Eghen 22 Backpack Review,1,4, Not to mention amga has petzl sponsorship so if he's testing and reviewing gear good chances hes a guide with the ability to get his hands on petzl for cheap or free.

4869,Cassin Eghen 22 Backpack Review,1,5, Oh man I need to turn on MP notifications! Sorry I missed these comments but to answer Briggs; 1) Not sponsored by Petzl but I did get the helmet and harness to review... all other Petzl gear was paid for out of pocket because I love that stuff :) 2) Rope-carrying feature.... ya~ embarrassed I didn't figure out that the mystery strap inside was intended to be threaded through a slot in back panel and made a great rope attachment system... another reader pointed that out so the info is now added to the review. Hope you guys are getting some good early season ice! Cheers~,Nov 2012,Dec 21 2017,3
4870,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,0, Wondering if anyone out there has used this battery in their van build outs. Looking for feedback. Preferably from someone who has lived in their van for months at a time. ,Aug 2014,Dec 21 2017,0
4871,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,1, I have not used the Yeti 1400. But I've looked at it and priced out building something comparable so I thought I'd share the info. I sometimes think these all-in-one solutions~ such as the controller-battery-inverter all in a single box might suffer from inferior components inside. The rig I have hypothetically thrown together below is made of some good equipment~ ie.~ premium batteries and solar charge controller~ both of which are the core of the system. I do note that the key benefit of the Yeti 1400 is the lithium battery which lends greatly to the rig being so lite weight at 56 pounds. Going with two Optima Yellowtop D34 sealed lead acid batteries would go at 86 pounds. Yeti 1400 + Nomad 100 panel 56 pounds 132 amp hours 100w solar panel $1900  Home brew rig 84 pounds 110 amp hours Renogy 150w solar panel $174 Morningstar MPPT 15 amp solar charge controller $243 Optima Yellowtop D34 battery $276x2=$552 1500 watt inverter $100 TOTAL $1069  The home brew rig is cheaper (got to add in some cable~ distribution and connectors~ though) and the panel is 50% better. However the batteries are heavier and less capacity. Add a third battery to the home brew~ and you get 165 amp hours~ 126 pounds and a total of $1345. That's still cheaper~ and probably better quality all-around but significantly more heavy.,Feb 2002,Dec 21 2017,0
4872,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,2, do a lot of work with FEMA and other GOV't agencies and have sold a lot of GZ stuff to them all.  Yeti 1250 not the 1400.  1400 is much lighter than 1250~ you'll blow your uterus out lifting the 1250.  both are great pieces of equipment.  other company to look at is http://gridless.com/,Jul 2015,Dec 21 2017,0
4873,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,3, John~ did you consider or find any available home brew lithium rigs?,Jul 2015,Dec 21 2017,0
4874,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,4, Definitely depends on how weight sensitive you are. With a van build~ I'd assume you'd mount the equipment in the vehicle and then leave it there. It's not like you are planning on lifting the battery and distro out of the van and carrying it around. Jim Urbec says above that the Yeti 1250 is a lot heavier (it doesn't have the lithium batteries) but it's a lot cheaper. Depends if you don't mind driving around with the extra weight. Anyway~ in the post above~ I priced in the Nomad 100 solar panel which is ridiculously expensive. Without panels~ the above comparison comes out to $1400 versus $895 for just batteries~ controller and inverter.,Feb 2002,Dec 21 2017,0
4875,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,5, John~ did you consider or find any available home brew lithium rigs? I haven't shopped around for lithium batteries. They are super light weight~ but I assume they are expensive. I believe the lithium batteries are a little more dangerous than sealed-lead acid batteries~ as far as explosion hazards go. Anyway I have four Optima Yellowtop D34 batteries in my 2011 Tacoma. No panels yet~ though. That is the next step~ just haven't gotten around to it. By the way~ the original poster would do well considering a way to have the vehicle charge the batteries while the engine is running. That way he can top-off the batteries at night~ for example~ when he is driving around. I use the IBS-DBS Dual Battery System to automatically connect the auxiliary battery system to the alternator while running and disconnect when the engine is shut off. An excellent addition to a vehicle solar charge system. Link below. http://ibs-tech.ch/en/products/dual-battery-system/ibs-dbs.html,Feb 2002,Dec 21 2017,1
4876,Goal Zero Yeti 1400 Lithium Experience?,1,6, From their site: Can consumers purchase Gridless Products? At this time~ Gridless products are only available for direct purchase by government agencies and large organizations. However~ consumers can rent Gridless products through our rental partner. For most users~ this will prove to be a more cost-effective and convenient solution.,Feb 2014,Dec 21 2017,0

4881,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,0," I just wanted to toss up a quick note on this little drill in case others were curious.  I don't put in many bolts~ maybe a couple dozen a year or 4-5 an outing (I put others into slabs for construction but I'm not counting those).  I have currently been using an 18v Makita as I purchased the rotary hammer drill because I'd already owned the circular saw~ drill~ and sawzall and as such had the batteries.    After getting a really good deal on a 3 piece M12 set that I couldn't pass up I'd stopped using the other Makita tools in that set completely and was keeping the set for no other reason than the hammer drill and occasional bolt placements.  I struggled to take the 12v seriously in all honesty but found myself consistently reaching for them over the 18v Makita.   Because I wanted to sell the Makita set I curiously searched to see if Milwaukee offered a rotary hammer drill in their M12 series.  To my surprise they not only offered one but two options~ a 1/2"" and a 5/8"" the latter being in their brushless Fuel line.  I chose to order the 5/8"" version which at HD was $228 (their current promo and a 10% discount) with the charger~ case~ and two 4.0ah batteries.   It just came and I tossed a few 3/8"" holes in both mason block and granite that I have floating around the yard.  I'm impressed~ I figure the Makita set will get me enough to pay for this drill and I have no doubts it will serve me well.  It does feel more like a toy compared to the Makita (7/8"") but given the limited number of holes I drill~ the weight savings~ ease of use and so on I have no doubts it will serve my needs well.   Mind you~ this is not intended to go out for a day of bolting or replace a 24v Bosch so don't expect that at all.  If you're just looking for something to do occasional bolting however this thing would be ideal.  I find it to be 85% as capable as my 18v Makita which to me is a fair exchange for the advantages I get from it.   As a side note~ being a 12v system~ they offer a car charger (without the need for an inverter) which would have come in handy for me many times in the past including being able to charge a battery on the way to a climb.  You also have the ability to use their 2.0 battery which is much smaller (175g versus 400g) though I haven't tested that battery so I'm not sure if it can do 2-3 holes 5"" deep in granite~ I will update when I have a chance however.",Jul 2008,Jan 31 2014,1
4882,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,1, Anyone know anything else about this drill? It seems like a good option for the occasional bolter.,Nov 2010,Nov 27 2017,0
4883,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,2," I have a M12 SDS 5/8"" Rotary hammer drill (Model 2416-22XC). At 3.9lbs~ it's a nice drill for long approaches~ if you have to carry it while climbing (ie for replacing rap stations)~ or for occasional use.  For comparison~ a BD Yosemite hammer + Petal hand drill is 2.25 lbs. I get more than 15 holes  (3/8"" in anorthosite rock) from one 4.0 Ahr battery (it comes with two).",Dec 2013,Nov 27 2017,2
4884,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,3, Awesome. I'm definitely not trying to bolt sport routes~ more anchor replacement and the occasional mixed endeavor.,Nov 2010,Nov 27 2017,0

4887,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,6, This is the drill I own.  I’ve had great luck with it so far.  I think I can get up to 9 holes that are 3/8” x 3” in Granite with the 4 amp hr battery.   If you ever plan on bolting on lead  or doing long multi pitch routes this is definitely the drill to own.  And really hard to beat for the price.,Jun 2014,Nov 27 2017,3

4890,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,9, Also worth mentioning... buying good drill bits will make a huge difference as well.,Oct 2017,Dec 6 2017,3
4891,Milwaukee Fuel M12 (12 volt) Rotary Hammer drill review,1,10,"  I have the older non-brushless milwuakee M18 big brother to this drill. I got it thrashed on ebay with 2 2ah batteries. I bought some 5 ah batteries which seem to not only last longer but actually make the drill hit harder and drill faster. +1 for bigger batteries.  In hard rock like quartzite~ we get like 2-4 holes before the bit goes dull and just runs the battery without making the hole any deeper. If it seems like your drill is spinning but not getting deeper~ stop and change the bit.  Keep an eye on ebay for ""lots"" of drill bits. Buying one is $8-15 bucks~ buying 10 is like $30. ",Aug 2009,Dec 6 2017,1
4892,The Nexxo (My Review),1,0, This shoe excels on steep routes but also have the precision for hard bouldering. I found that i had to size a half size up (usually a 10 in Evolv but 10.5 in Nexxo). Since these shoes so aggressive but have such a stiff mid-sole you can continue to feel the power through long over hangs. This shoe is way stiffer then something like the Teams. The Nexxo is also surprisingly sensitive and the love bump makes sure your toes are in a comfy position. The Heal cup is slightly lower volume then the Shaman which works well for me. The one suggestion I would say is that there needs to be more rubber on the top for better toe hooking but this has not hindered me too much. I have mainly used my Nexxo's for sport climbing at Rumney~ NH and the Red river Gorge~ KY. I would very much recommend these shoes!,Oct 2013,Sep 8 2014,0
4893,The Nexxo (My Review),1,1, I have a pair that I've been wearing on and off for a few months.  My impressions: ,May 2011,Nov 19 2014,0
4894,The Nexxo (My Review),1,2, In my opinion this is Evolvs best and most advanced shoe.  It marks a big leap in technology for them and it shows.   I bought this shoe specifically for the Red River Gorge.  I climb primarily at Smith Rock and did not expect them to work there very well.  Once day i decided to break them in at Smith.  What a surprise.  These shoes work so ridiculously well on anything except vertical or under.  If the rock over hangs at all i found i could smear~ and stand on anything.  Grains of sand~ slippery little depressions.  These shoes gave me more confidence in my feet than ever before.   I wear a size 8.5 street shoe and a size 8 Nexxo. They are snug but not at all uncomfortable.    My evolv sizing is 8.5 Shaman~ 8 Nexxo~ 7.5 Pontas   Full Disclosure.  I am an Evolv Athlete.  That doesnt change the fact I really enjoy the shoes.,Jun 2011,Feb 4 2015,1

4898,La Sportiva Nepal Evo GTX Mountaineering Boot Review,1,0, It is considered to be one of the best mountaineering boots~ for sure~ it is one of the most iconic mountaineering boots there are out in the market. The La Sportiva Nepal Evo GTX~ is indeed~ a great piece of gear for multiple winter mountaineering activities. From an easy Alpine route~ to mixed climb up to ice climbing. La Sportiva’s Nepal Evo GTX is one of the most popular mountaineering boots of all time; a combination of rugged~ supportive 3.2mm Perwanger leather~ classic lacing system~ lugged Vibram sole with rigid midsole~ all lined with insulated Gore-Tex to keep a mountaineer warm and dry. Full review with many photos and details here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2017/11/27/la-sportiva-nepal-evo-gtx-mountaineering-boot-review/  UPPER The usage of the insulating Gore-Tex/Duratherm lining makes it completely waterproof and breathable. The upper features the “3D Flex System” hinge~ innovative system of multidirectional ankle hinge~ combined with an elastic anatomical snow protection in the back~ with a small integrated elastic gaiter. New removable tongue with incorporated ventilation system~ gives the option of adjusting the fit~ personalized for any foot. The EZ Out pull loop(Patent Pending) facilitates the unlocking of the lace lock. The new model weights only 2050 grams per pair. A traditional lacing system allows the wearer to tighten or loosen where needed~ and is further enhanced by the presence of a set of locking eyelets just before the ankle. These D-rings cam down to lock the lower part of the Nepal’s laces in place~ which gives the wearer the choice of keeping the lower and upper parts of the laces at different levels of tightness. The La Sportiva Nepal Evo GTX cuff is padded and ergonomic~ and includes a thin elastic gaiter at the rear to keep snow or other items from entering. This is actually one of my favourite features of the boot. The insulating Ibi-Thermo footbed gives the boot exceptional insulation from the cold.  MIDSOLE~ OUTSOLE New tapered HP3 midsole and shock absorbing PU inserts in the area under the heel and the ball of the foot. New exclusive sole with the innovative technology IBS (Impact Brake System)~ developed in collaboration with Vibram~ designed to soften impact on hard ground. Another great feature of this mountaineering boot is the fact that it can be easily resoled (with the official Vibram Sole) by your local craftman. In fact~ having used these boots extensively~ I have already resoled the Nepal’s once. The IBS (Impact Brake System) innovative system is applied to the sole toabsorb negative ground impact~ help traction and improve grip downhill. Created and developed by the R&D department at La Sportiva~ it offers real advantages during racing by reducing negative ground impact. The unique position of the lugs allows as many of them as possible to come into contact with the ground~ for maximum impact absorption.  Comfort/Performance The La Sportiva Nepal Evo GTX is perhaps the most comfortable mountaineering boots I have ever used. Of course~ this is not just my personal opinion~ but is a shared opinion amongst the mountaineering community. In terms of performance~ I have found these boots to be precise while ice climbing but also when rock scrambling. In addition~ due to the fact here in Greece the mountains are not always covered with snow from the starting point~ I have used these boots also for the approach hike without any issues.

4900,Hyperlite Ultamid 2 and 4400 Ice Pack ,1,0," I had the privilege of joining Sierra Mountaineering Club to attempt Mt Shasta via the West Face to the summit crater of Shastina~ where we camped for the night. The original plan was to attempt the summit of Shasta via the Whitney Glacier~ but things didn't work out as planned... We had brought all the standard group gear (e.g. 4 season tent~ snow pickets~ rope~ etc)~ and I had brought a couple of extra items along for field testing purposes~ from Hyperlite Mountaineering: their Ice Pack and Ultamid 2 ultralight tent. The pack was pretty amazing~ carrying a far lighter load because I had 4400 cu in to play with and the pack weighed 2.5 pounds. Carried the load well across all of the terrain between Bunny Flat and the summit crater (which included a couloir at a 45 or so deg angle and talus / scree areas). It's now my dedicated pack. I absolutely love it.   The tent was pretty cool once you figure out how to pitch it. It weighs 1.1 pounds with the guy lines~ so extremely light. I pitched it out at standard height~ then used the standard 3-season aluminum stakes to make multiple mini-deadman anchors (yes~ I know these were totally inappropriate stakes to use~ but I wanted to test how well they would hold in the wind). I used my ice axe plunged to the limit as the upwind guy line anchor. This was perfectly fine in the mild wind we had just before going to bed.    In the photo below~ the HMG Ultamid 2 is on the left.  We are in the Shastina summit crater.  Mt. Shasta's on the right.  ... But then the weather conditions changed. And I was awoken at 9:30 with half the Ultamid getting ripped out all along my sleeping bag. Near- whiteout conditions with 40-50 (?) mph winds. It was an ""interesting"" experience to be abruptly awoken that way~ for sure! So~ I grabbed the edge of the tent to keep my single trekking pole support upright (i.e. keep the tent up) while I took a minute or so to wake up and think about how to solve the problem. Then I rolled the edge of the tent under my butt and managed to wiggle into some clothes and a jacket~ followed by sliding on my boots. Painful with wind / snow / tent blowing everywhere. Then I went out and re-staked the mini-deadman anchors before going out to find the snow pickets. Once I had four snow pickets crammed in as replacements for the totally inappropriate 3 season stakes I had~ the tent was fully secure.  There was ZERO damage to the tent fabric or accessory cord lines for staking / guy line placement.  ZERO damage to my 10-year old MSR hiking poles used as the single support tent pole. My partner had his expo North Face 3-man tent and used SMC snow stakes~ however the storm ripped those out. So~ we had a situation of eventually needing to use every ice axe and snow picket we had to button up the expo tent~ and I abandoned the Ultamid and joined the other guys in the expo tent. Field test was over. The results: I learned a tough~ but important lesson in proper anchorage of a tent when at high altitude. Never again will I use anything but snow stakes backed up with snow pickets +/- other gear like ice axes. My initial impression is the Ultamid can handle very high winds~ so long as you do the following: 1. Absolutely take the time and bring the appropriate equipment to stake it out properly. 2. Shovel about a foot or two of snow as a barrier around the upwind rim of the tent to prevent wind from getting under the lip of the tent and lifting it (this was a strong suggestion from HMG's ambassadors who took it to the Himalayans).   So~ if you haven't ever ridden out a storm at high altitude~ good lessons learned~ and very cool and exciting equipment from HMG.  Disclaimer: I purchased all of the HMG equipment and have zero financial interest in HMG as a company.    ",May 2012,Jun 5 2017,0
4901,Hyperlite Ultamid 2 and 4400 Ice Pack ,1,1, I have a cilogear 40b as my go to pack that I've  and been using and abusing~ stuffing my trad rack in it sll the time and ill be seeing how it hokds up during ice season. I was intetested in the same pack you reviewed here by hyperlite but was hesitant. couldn't find one to try on etc which made it frustrating. Not like I could order one and return it if the size and /or fit was off. Love to try this Hyperlite  pack out though! ,Apr 2015,Nov 24 2017,1
4902,Cumulus Incredilite Endurance down jacket Review,1,0, Winter is approaching and is time for a review of one of my favourite down jackets. This is an 850 cuin goose down jacket from a Polish brand named Cumulus. I have used this down jacket for 18+ months now on various occasions. From winter mountaineering activities~ as insulation jacket while camping but also for daily use when temperatures drop down in my area. Read full review with more photos here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2017/11/01/cumulus-incredilite-endurance-down-jacket-long-term-review/ My personal experience with the Cumulus brand is more than positive and this also includes the amazing lightweight down jacket Cumulus Incredilite Endurance. It uses Pertex Endurance on the outside~ making the shell waterproof to a column of 1000mm. Pertex Quantum on the inside. Talking about the inside~ I would love to see the inside in Pertex Endurance~ because it happened a couple of times when I wore the down jacket while being full of sweat and as expected the goose down lost its insulated property. I know the new Incredilite Endurance model is using Hydrophobic Down~ but still~ I think the whole jacket should have a better waterproof shell. Pertex Quantum DWR fabric and filled with Polish 850 cuin white goose down. Designed in cooperation with the group of outdoor enthusiasts connected with fromoutdoor.org.pl.  Materials Down The down used is from the highly-regarded Polish goose~ which is considered the best in the world in terms of the fill power. These down feathers are one of the most important component of Cumulus’ products~ because it determines the efficiency of the insulation and provides reliable comfort even in the most hostile conditions. It is this down which affects the quality of the products to the greatest extent. Pertex Endurance Waterproof fabric with a thin membrane. Its biggest advantage is the extremely high breathability~ compared to a thick membrane. It is an ideal material when you require a higher resistance to condensing moisture without losing the smooth discharge of water vapour from the body to the outside. It is perfect as a top coat of down jackets and sleeping bags~ greatly increasing their resistance to water. YKK zippers It is said that at the ISPO and Friedrichshafen trade fair~ about 95% of the products are equipped with YKK zippers with very good reason: these are the most durable zippers.

4904,Cumulus Incredilite Endurance down jacket Review,1,2, I do not know about it. Though~ also in my country this jacket was not available and I have ordered it directly from the Cumulus website. Within 4 days~ I had the jacket on my door.,Oct 2017,Nov 21 2017,0
4905,Petzl RAD Line ,1,0, Any reviews would be appreciated.  Comparisons to other current 5.5mm-7mm static rappel lines on the market would be even more appreciated...  My primary interest is in using a 60m RAD line (in conjunction with a dynamic single rope) as a light and compact pull cord for rappels >30m and occasional haul line for packs.  However~ I am also potentially interested in using it as a primary safety line for glacier traverses.    On paper~ the main appeals are:  1. Low density of 22 g/m (closest competing product is 31 g/m [41% heavier for a given length]). 2. High friction~ abrasion resistant sheath 3. Compatible with microtraxion 4. Low elongation~ under load  More info from Petzl can be found at https://www.petzl.com/INT/en/Sport/Ropes/RAD-LINE-6-mm ,Aug 2013,Nov 13 2017,0
4906,Petzl RAD Line ,1,1, You really want a STATIC cord for glacier travel? Where a climber could fall with slack in the system??,Jul 2009,Nov 13 2017,0
4907,Petzl RAD Line ,1,2, I’ve had a 60m one for a year or so as a second line for raps. I’m not sure what to say. It works. It seems to show less wear than the accesory cord I used prior to it. The textured sheath allows better grip on rappels than accessory cord Beal has a 5.5mm Aramid cord at 21g/m called the Backup Line coming out this season that’s less than half the price.,Oct 2007,Nov 13 2017,0
4908,Petzl RAD Line ,1,3, so it's a blend of aramid and dyneema. Essentially technora cord but with a more abrasive sheath. You have a cord that has really good abrasion and cut resistance but very low strength efficiency when knotted (60% strength reduction with a figure 8 in technora~ probably similar or worse with this cord) and little UV resistance. Keep that in mind when you're making your decision. ,May 2014,Nov 13 2017,0
4909,Petzl RAD Line ,1,4, I’ve had a 60m one for a year or so as a second line for raps. I’m not sure what to say. It works. It seems to show less wear than the accesory cord I used prior to it. The textured sheath allows better grip on rappels than accessory cord Beal has a 5.5mm Aramid cord at 21g/m called the Backup Line coming out this season that’s less than half the price. Is that the pull cord that is designed to work as a static cord at low loads but then at very high loads the sheath breaks and it acts like a dynamic rope? I remember reading an article about such a pull cord a few years ago but never have been able to find any info on. The point was that if you're ropes got stuck on a rap and you only had access to the pull cord you could re-lead the pitch on the pull cord.,May 2014,Nov 13 2017,0
4910,Petzl RAD Line ,1,5, Is that the pull cord that is designed to work as a static cord at low loads but then at very high loads the sheath breaks and it acts like a dynamic rope? I remember reading an article about such a pull cord a few years ago but never have been able to find any info on. The point was that if you're ropes got stuck on a rap and you only had access to the pull cord you could re-lead the pitch on the pull cord. No~ that’s Edelrid’s Rap Line 2. It came out around the same time as the RAD line. Funny you mention it: I actually bought 3 pull cords all at the same time last year and kept my favorite. The Rap Line 2 was advertised prior to release at 25g/m. It was actually 31g/m and is now advertised as such. At that weight~ it’s hard to justify against a 35g/m Flycatcher or 36g/m Beal Gully. I had planned to use the Rap Line 2 as my only rope for easy alpine climbing. Yeah I know that’s not how it is supposed to be used. The 3rd cord I got at that time was an Esprit Alpine Personal Escape Rope~ a special order item from Esprit. It’s designed to be super stiff so it is less likely to drape behind flakes or into cracks and get stuck. And it was. You could hold like 12-18 inches of the end of it sideways and it would stay straight. It made packing it very bulky. I sold the Rap Line 2 and APER on here and kept the RAD Line.  Just a heads up: Petzl's information on knots and the RAD line may be different than you're used to seeing. The flat-8 is significantly stronger than the flat-overhand~ and the flat-8 does not roll~ at least when tying RAD Line to RAD Line. Read the technical notices closely. https://www.petzl.com/INT/en/Sport/RAD-LINE-joining-knots?ProductName=RAD-SYSTEM,Oct 2007,Nov 14 2017,1
4911,Petzl RAD Line ,1,6, You really want a STATIC cord for glacier travel? Where a climber could fall with slack in the system?? Yes. Petzl has specifically tested this application (as has ENSA~ I believe). Basically~ a static line makes the initial catch somewhat more jarring. However~ the static rope eliminates (or significantly reduces) rebound~ which can be really challenging when holding the fall with a dynamic rope. Generally speaking~ the rope sliding on the snow causes friction such that the catch on a static line is pretty manageable.,Jul 2010,Nov 14 2017,2
4912,Petzl RAD Line ,1,7, Beal has a 5.5mm Aramid cord at 21g/m called the Backup Line coming out this season that’s less than half the price. Does anyone know what the expected release date is for the Beal Backup Line?  Based on limited info~ it may be a better / more cost-effective option than the RAD line for use as a tag line.  ,Aug 2013,Nov 15 2017,0
4913,Petzl RAD Line ,1,8," Just a heads up: Petzl's information on knots and the RAD line may be different than you're used to seeing. The flat-8 is significantly stronger than the flat-overhand~ and the flat-8 does not roll~ at least when tying RAD Line to RAD Line. Read the technical notices closely. https://www.petzl.com/INT/en/Sport/RAD-LINE-joining-knots?ProductName=RAD-SYSTEM While interesting and unexpected that Petzl is advocating for the use of a flat-8 for RAD-to-RAD bends~ my takeaway from the Petzl technical notice is that that you should continue to use the bends that you would normally consider best practice for joining other cordalettes and climbing ropes (i.e.~ flat-overhand bend for rappels).  Keep in mind that that most people will be more often joining the RAD line to dynamic nylon climbing ropes~ which is not explicitly addressed in the technical notice.   Key excerpts from the Petzl technical notice:   - ""The flat overhand bend is strong enough for the forces in a normal rappel"" - ""All of the knots tested are strong enough for the loads recorded during the crevasse fall testing.""",Aug 2013,Nov 15 2017,1
4914,Petzl RAD Line ,1,9, Yep. FWIW~ I have used mine with a Beal Opera 8.5~ Mammut Serenity 8.7~ and a Mammut Revelation 9.2~ all with overhand EDKs~ and never with any issue. I often rap on both strands~ rather than using a block and just pulling the RAD. In spite of the warning by Petzl that there might not be enough friction~ I haven't had any problems doing this with a DMM Pivot. I do almost always use a Sterling Hollow Block when rapping. ,Oct 2007,Nov 15 2017,1
4915,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,0, Just moved to Colorado from the south east~ so my UL kit won't cut it above tree line or sub freezing.  What are your favorite four season tents? I'm looking at some of the free standing 2p hilleberg or the new msr remote series. I plan to get a nice and toasty sleeping bag to pair it all with too. Weight is a concern~ but not a major one as I can always bivy if I want true UL. thanks! ,Feb 2013,Aug 7 2017,0
4916,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,1, For what activities? I have a North Face VE25 and a Black Diamond Firstlight. Both are great at what they do. Hilleberg is fantastic for its thing~ too.,Jan 2012,Aug 7 2017,1
4917,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,2, Hilleberg~ after 11 years~ 30-60 nights of use a year~ rain~ snow~ heat~ high altitude~ I finally replaced it with another Hilleberg. The old one probably had several years left but the zipper started sticking and I'm lazy. Just make sure to get a footprint to extend its life.  That tent is probably the single most comfortable~ useable~ bombproof piece of gear I've ever owned.  ,Mar 2006,Aug 7 2017,5
4918,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,3, Thanks all. It would be mostly used for base camping or multi day trips above treeline in the winter. Weight isn't a huge factor~ more interested in warmth/ease of set up and livability. If I need to go fast and light for an overnight I can bivy.   All signs are pointing toward hilleberg~ but was curious if anyone didn't like them. ,Feb 2013,Aug 8 2017,0
4919,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,4, I find that my Mountain Hardwear EV2 strikes a great balance of weight~ ease of setup~ and liveability.  The built-in vestibule (really just an extension of the tent body) works really well in practice.  The tent is very strong too.  I got mine for a killer deal at $375.  It's acceptably light at just over 5 pounds when you need something bombproof. ,Jun 2013,Aug 8 2017,0
4920,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,5, i have the Hilleberg Atko 1p and love it. I was only able to purchase it thanks to a pro deal but have used it in a variety of inclement conditions and love it. Also~ it weighs less than a kilo.,Nov 2013,Aug 8 2017,1
4921,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,6," If you anticipate heavy snowfalls and expect to be away from your tent for extended periods~ the freestanding Hillebergs may be the better way to go as they can handle a bit more snow loading due to the design~ however the Hille tunnel tents typically offer more usable living space for less weight.  I just bought a Nammatj 3 GT and am looking forward to getting it out in some snow(the thing is HUGE!~ I can lay perfectly flat on my back diagonally in the vestibule without touching my head or feet on anything~ I'm somewhere between 5'9"" and 5'10""for reference) .  I am however also contemplating getting a one or two man tent as well for any trips without another person or one or both of my dogs (likely a Nammatj 2 as the tunnel tent design has really grown on me~ and other than a tiny solid rock bivy ledge cannot imagine a spot where I could only pitch a freestanding tent~ though the Unna~ Soulo~ and Jannu are in the mix as well). Surprisingly simple to pitch as well in spite of not being freestanding~ I had it pitched nice and taut in under 10 mins. on my first attempt without having ever looked at any instructions.  Ultralight is definitely one thing that most Hillebergs are not~ but they are very durable~ well designed and put together. I don't have any extended use reports for you with it yet as I just got mine yesterday~ but there are thousands of those that are easily found on the internet. Good luck with your choice and enjoy whatever it is you decide on.",Aug 2016,Aug 9 2017,1
4922,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,7, Thanks Jesse~ I'm thinking between the Kaitum~ the januu~ and the tarra. Good problem to debate. Hilleberg doesn't seem to have too many competitors from what I've seen... ,Feb 2013,Aug 10 2017,0

4925,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,10, Trango 3 is what I rock. The lofts in the walls for storage and vestibule all attribute to its versatile construction~ guy lines anchored~ it's a house~ unmovable. And reflective fiber in the tag lines help find it in storms especially with a headlamp.  Has the light weight option where you can pitch the fly and the footprint as well.  Heavy weight is a drawback~ but split it with a partner~or go with the evo2. ,Jun 2017,Oct 22 2017,1
4926,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,11, Have both a MH Annapurna and an EV2.  Annapurna is absolutely great if you can find one and want double-wall I highly recommend it.  Everyone that's spent a night in it have loved the features for the weight.  Essentially a Trango 2 on a diet.  The EV2 is OK for a night or two~ and it was fine in AK on the West Butt with single occupancy.   Hilleberg are awesome~ with an awesome price to boot.  ,Jun 2017,Oct 23 2017,0
4927,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,12, Discontinued but still able to find on some websites I bought the mountain hardwear hoopster. Lots if space~ Floorless so you can dig deeper and have more room or use for a community space. Design is bombproof in weather with 20 stake and guyout points. Hoop opens up headroom and best of all I had a stove jack sewn in for 20$ by a local company and now I pair it with a small seekoutside titanium stove and you can get this thing to 70° easily in the dead of winter. Dry out gear and having a warm space in your base camp is a game changer. It weighs about 6lb with everything so its not UL but I throw it in a pulk sled for getting to my base camp and setting up. Its not canvas so you need to take care with sparks but that's easily remedied and the design of the stoves creates a draft where the only sparks really might make it past the spark arrester outside but no sparks inside the tent. I wanted a different take on base camping and I'm glad I weny this route. The direkt 2 is a single wall but it weighs like 2lb packs super small and same material as hoopster so if you need a satellite sleeping tent away from the hoopster is go that option. Mountain hardwear did some good thinking.,Sep 2017,Oct 25 2017,0
4928,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,13, Hilleberg~ after 11 years~ 30-60 nights of use a year~ rain~ snow~ heat~ high altitude~ I finally replaced it with another Hilleberg. The old one probably had several years left but the zipper started sticking and I'm lazy. Just make sure to get a footprint to extend its life.  That tent is probably the single most comfortable~ useable~ bombproof piece of gear I've ever owned.  You replaced an entire (extremely expensive) tent because the zipper was sticky? Fail,Oct 2017,Oct 25 2017,0
4929,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,14, They no longer make them but the past year Sierra Design Convert 2 has been serving me well. double wall with similar pitching to the Hillebergs. The new one doesn't interest me as it goes back to a separate fly and body.,Feb 2017,Oct 25 2017,0
4930,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,15, They no longer make them but the past year Sierra Design Convert 2 has been serving me well. double wall with similar pitching to the Hillebergs. The new one doesn't interest me as it goes back to a separate fly and body. Yep~ I have and love the Convert 2. I really like the single wall design for alpine trips that don't need or require an extended base camp. The Big Agnes Shield 2 is very similar and also really good. Both tents vent and handle storms really well. No condensation inside the tent. Only downside is the vestibule is extra on the Shield 2. But it's crazy light for a 4-season tent. ,Aug 2011,Oct 25 2017,0
4931,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,16, Msr has new 4 seasons ~ Nemo kunai 2p.... these options are half the weight of some of the traditional 4 season tents,Mar 2015,Oct 29 2017,0
4932,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,17, I have a Jannu~ nice functional tent. Only annoyance is condensation forms on the high bathtube walls~ and the foot end of the tent is quite sloppy so you might get your footbox a bit wet in light of the mentioned condensation. Sure isn't light though so gets left behind on some snow trips in favour of a mid~ which is a happy place below freezing - though I don't use the mid above the tree line - I figure its size is going to lead to a lot of wind being caught.,Apr 2015,Nov 11 2017,0
4933,Favorite four season tent ? ,1,18, I really like my hillebergs.  Have 2 Nammajt 3s and a Keron 4GT.  Used for expedition style outings.  I haven’t dabbled in alpine fast and light style climbs in hard winter conditions yet; but if I was going to get into that~ I could see switching to a single wall ultralight option from MSR.   I’ll push the limit of my -20 sleeping bag using only a Cuben fiber flat tarp with a ground cloth~ because I have usually only tried climbs that either require expedition style~ or they are objectives where I know I can bail easily/safely; so maybe that style also fits your criteria?  But if you really need full protection for committing routes probably not a good choice.  Best to opt for a fully enclosed structure then ,Nov 2015,Nov 12 2017,0
4934,5.10 New White Synthetic Mocs,1,0, Anyone have a review on these and how they compare to the traditional red mocs? ,Mar 2015,Jun 15 2017,0
4935,5.10 New White Synthetic Mocs,1,1, I bought a pair in August.  I sized them a half size bigger than my moccs.  Out of the box~ they fit just like my broken in Reds Anasazis and the fit has remained consistent!  Awesome.  After 6 weeks of climbing in the gym (2x a week) and one trip to Trout Creek~ I developed holes along the edge of both pinky toes.  The synthetic leather got super thin in contact spots until it failed altogether. As a soft gym shoe or granite slab shoe~ I would highly recommend it.  However~ if you're jamming~ be prepared to barge cement them from day one.  And don't expect to get multiple re-soles out of the synthetic leather.   ,Aug 2012,Nov 8 2017,3

4939,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,0, Looking for a great belay device with assisted braking.  Loved the concept behing the Vergo.  Then the recall.  Waited a while~ then received the corrected Vergo.  Baam...second recall shortly thereafter. (Some of the pins were not peened correctly). Returned it for the second recall.  Waited a few months~ contacted Trango Monday the 23rd of October for an ETA.  Their answer~ “No timeline available”. No way I’m waiting indefinitely. And even though I REALLY like their Vergo design~ I’m still getting a refund.  So now what to get? REVO~ GriGri+~ or something else? What do y’all think of the new GriGri+?  ,Jun 2016,Oct 25 2017,0
4940,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,1, I'm in the same boat~ losing patience with Trango. I think the gri gri 2 is the standard all around sport climbing choice~ the + is heavier~ more durable and has some features oriented to new climbers like the anti panic lever. I don't know anyone with a revo~ looks pretty beefy. I'm actually intrigued by the BD ATC Pilot~ anyone got miles on that yet? The video looks simple~ easy to use and hard to use wrong.,Nov 2001,Oct 25 2017,0
4941,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,2, Just get the grigri2~ unless the stainless wear plate on the grigri+ appeals to you because you climb lots and with sandy ropes.,Sep 2013,Oct 25 2017,8
4942,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,3, Grigri2. Gets the job done at a high level across the board. Isn't perfect in every category~ but gets high marks in all of them~ which is more than any other device on the market. The grigri+ is~ imho~ probably an institutional device and not really worth the money. I don't think they're becoming a replacement for the 2- too pricey for no real gains.  The revo isn't out yet~ but is coming soon. Pricey and bulky~ it'll be popular with a certain segment of the climbing community for some slick ingenuity~ but imho~ too heavy~ expensive and bulky to be considered a replacement for the grigri2 and everything it's capable of. ,unknown,Oct 25 2017,4
4943,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,4, Get a Gri Gri the Revo is already 2 years coming~ with not definite retail release,Feb 2016,Oct 25 2017,1
4944,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,5, I like the GriGri 2 and the GriGri + I like how simple the grigri 2 is The grigri + is great because it is def more durable.  I also like the TR mode for top belay off the anchor on multi pitch routes.  I carry a grigri on all multi pitch routes now.,Jul 2007,Oct 25 2017,1

4946,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,7, I'm not quite in your boat - I'm happy with my ATC~ I prefer an ATC to a grigri~ but I'm willing to try something that sounds like it might be an improved ATC. So I've decided to try the revo when it comes out~ I like that it basically is the ATC that I like so much~ just has a safety mechanism to save the climber if I'm knocked out by rockfall or if I fumble the rope or whatever. But if you're in more of a hurry than me~ or not as big a fan of tube belay devices~ then I'd just get one from the GriGri family. They're popular~ they work well~ I've used one and while I prefer an ATC I can see why so many people like the GriGri.,Jul 2012,Oct 26 2017,2
4947,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,8, The revo isn't out yet~ but is coming soon. Pricey and bulky~ it'll be popular with a certain segment of the climbing community for some slick ingenuity~ but imho~ too heavy~ expensive and bulky to be considered a replacement for the grigri2 and everything it's capable of.  So the device isn't even out yet and you're already making judgement based on information that hasn't been released yet. Have they released a price figure yet? and how can you claim to know how much it weighs when it's not even out yet.

The top vs lead mode is useful if not entirely necessary~ and the panic break in the lever has never bothered me like it does some people~ maybe because I tend to lower my partner using the lever more as a joystick than an on/off switch.

4950,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,11, I just got the BD Pilot. I belayed a half dozen pitches with it today and my partner also used it to belay me. I still probably like the Grigri better for single pitch stuff~ but if you're someone that likes a tube style device because of simplicity~ weight~ etc. Then I think you should really take a look at the Pilot. It was pretty easy to get used to keeping the brake hand thumb under the lip when feeding rope up. It definitely works better than the Mammut Smart. I haven't used the Megajul but my partner has and he said that the Pilot is definitely better in that respect too.  We each took some victory falls (it was a lunch time session in the gym)  to test the catch and holding power. It caught falls well. It does let a little rope slide through (maybe 1 ft.)~ which is nice for a soft catch~ but could possibly be a problem if you're trying to keep someone from decking. One thing I really liked was the control in lowering. It has a fairly wide sweet spot which I thought controlled lowering the climber even better than a Grigri. Sometimes I wish I had belay glove on with the grigri~ but the Pilot was easy to find and keep a speed that I felt comfortable with. We used a BD Vaporlock carabiner. One last thing to note. When locked up with a climber hanging with full weight on the rope it will let the rope slowly slide through the device if you're not applying braking pressure. Since it keeps the rope sliding through in a straight line it also kept any twists or kinks from forming in the rope. ,Aug 2011,Oct 26 2017,1

In fact~ that's the only mistake I can see being possible with it. ...and yet~ there's giant indicators engraved on the GriGri.

4954,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,15, Love my Mad Rock Lifeguard. Smaller and lighter than a Grigri2~ feeds slack without locking up. I was super excited for my Lifeguard when it showed up and it works great in most situations BUT if you plan on doing a lot of rapping with it (which I do because I primarily solo bigwall climb or siege climb bigwall FAs) then the Lifeguard is not going to be a good choice. This is because the handle is made of metal so rapping more than 30m at a time tends to make the handle heat up to the point of not being able to touch it. But then again~ if you're bigwalling then you're wearing wall gloves which helps. Also~ it does cool off relatively quick. ,Jan 2007,Oct 26 2017,2

You're entitled to your opinion. I've stated mine. Nothing in yours contradicts what I said. Some people will be psyched on the Revo~ but most~ imho~ won't. It's heavier~ bulkier~ and more expensive than the grigri. As an aside~ the pricing on the Revo is likely to be well north of $99 (previous posted pricing was $129~ and I doubt it will be less).  It's been my experience that those new devices that have tried to compete with the grigri have never been able to really dent its market. Those that are better from a safety perspective tend to be heavier and/or more expensive (Eddy~ Matik)~ and those that have beaten it on price and weight (Cinch/Vergo) have struggled with their own safety issues. I suspect that the Revo will fall into the Eddy and Matik arena- safer~ but price and bulk will prevent mass adoption. I could be wrong~ of course~ but history has a way of repeating itself.  On a final note. There are trade offs with every device and everyone has to make their own calls about what they feel comfortable using. I don't particularly care what other people use~ so long as they are comfortable and competent with it. If you're psyched on the Revo~ more power to you. ,unknown,Oct 26 2017,2
4957,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,1,18, Not sure if I want to carry/feel the bulk of the REVO.  Some things about the REVO attract me (smoothness in feeding rope~ and safety)~ but others don’t. (High cost~ extra weight). I was interested in the GriGri+...but hear that some folks at indoor climbing gyms with thicker ropes~ are constantly overshooting the sweet spot and locking the device multiple times.  The latter REALLY turned me OFF.  The GriGri2 has been time-tested~ and seems to be the best bet.  By the way~ I use a Mammut 9.5mm rope when I lead climb.  Still considering my options.  As soon as I receive the Trango Vergo refund...I’ll be purchasing the new belay device. (Any day now). UPDATE: Seriously considering the MR Lifeguard now. ,Jun 2016,Oct 26 2017,0

If the former~ then No~ from the spec sheets and instruction manuals~ it will not require a tighter grip on the rope (as no assisted belay device that I can think of depending upon the tightness by which the user grips the rope) but instead will require the internal unit to revolve until it reaches its catch point before locking - which based upon the size of it~ wouldn't be more than a few inches of rope.

I'll give that a try~ but as long as there is some pressure on the brake side of the rope the climber stays put. The way the braking works is it uses the side of the carabiner when locking up so it uses the wide side and not the narrow profile~ so I'm not sure that a fatter round stock carabiner will do anything~ but I definitely want to try with some other options to see what does best. My usual belay biner is the older bar stock Petzl Attache. The BD recomended biners are the vapor and gridlock. ,Aug 2011,Oct 27 2017,0

4973,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,2,13, Didn't care to really read all of these~ as I am procrastinating writing a paper and am also slightly tipsy (yay college).  My two cents is as follows: I have used the grigri 2 for years~ the grigri+ throughout the past year~ demoed the Revo for a day~ demoed the Pilot for a day. I love the grigri2~ as it works~ proves it works and is sort of the standard for today's sport climber. Boinking~ catching falls~ giving slack quick~ it does it all if you know how to use it properly. The grigri + is similar~ with added durability and the anti-panic feature. My girlfriend uses this device and loves it. I did not at first~ as the index finger catch is much smaller making it harder to hold. yet it is nice in TR mode~ doesn't make a difference from the grigri2 in lead mode. The anti-panic component of the + is nice and a nuisance at the same time. If I guided frequently~ I would enjoy it. Lowering friends from a climb~ not so much at first. I learned to get used to it~ becoming indifferent.  As for the Revo~ I was super stoked when I initially heard about it. Awesome sounding and looking device. Then demoing it~ I couldn't get it to catch and lock. I was basically told I was belaying too much like an ATC for it to lock the way it was supposed to. My climber would whip~ I'd keep my brake hand down~ no locking~ just normal ATC-style friction catch for the fall. Boinking up the rope was a pain in the ass due to this. If I didn't know proper belay technique (or more Euro-style~ no offense) of keeping the brake hand above the device~ the likelihood of a catch would have been much greater. While lowering my partner~ I did intentionally let go with both hands~ and the device did lock up. Hands free~ still definitely a no. But that is the only time I truly was able to get it to lock. Basically it degraded into my mind into a rich person's ATC. Sad. The Pilot is like a Jul style device. A little clunky at first when using it because I hadn't used that style much in the past. It worked and caught falls fine. It did have the potential to feed rope back through the device when locked if the brake side of the rope was slack. I wasn't super impressed. If I wanted something between an ATC and a grigri~ I'd get a megajul or a mammoth smart alpine so I could at least rappel with it as well.  Overall~ since I have the grigri2~ I'll stay with it for sport climbing. If I start guiding more~ perhaps a grigri+. If I am doing technical~ hard multi pitch climbs the mega-jul is where I'd turn. I hope that helps a bit.,Feb 2012,Oct 27 2017,4
4974,GriGri+~ REVO~ or what?,2,14, Oh man~ I'd love to try a Revo out for TR and lead soloing. If it turns out to be well built and functional~ it'll pretty much be THE item on the market for these uses. If you're into roped soloing and want to be a trailblazer~ it's a pretty exciting option. If roped soloing isn't your bag~ there's really no significant downside to a gri. For normal belaying~ the best the Revo can offer is to catch you no matter what.

5007,Enough bullshit lightweight down jackets,2,2, Lighter fabrics allow the down to loft better. I agree down products are fragile and favor synthetic jackets personally. The shells aren't any different but when you rip the synthetic jacket your insulation won't go flying everywhere. For sleeping bags down is obviously better~ they get less abuse and they're bigger so the weight/packing advantage is more significant. If you want a burly-ish down jacket Nunatak can make you one with an Epic shell. It's not backpack fabric but it's more durable than typical ~1oz shells.  Pertex is the most widely used shell fabric. Chances are most of the jackets you're complaining about had a Pertex shell. Shield is a water resistant laminate~ doubt it does much for durability. ,Sep 2013,Sep 26 2017,0

The pertex shell makes a big difference. There is no comparison in the toughness of a Arcteryx Cerium or MH Ghost Whisperer face fabric and the Pertex face fabric. I wouldn't go bush whacking with either of them~ but the pertex doesn't feel like it's going to rip to shreds when you rub up against something. The Cerium and GW both do.

5021,Enough bullshit lightweight down jackets,2,16, Hey Ben jammin~ Your request for 800 fill power at minimum and also a burly fabric isn't going to happen. The reason is because fill power is a measurement of how much down will rebound its loft after being compressed. The reason that jackets using high fill down~ use light fabrics is because heavy fabrics compress the down and you don't obtain the loft. If you spent the money on 900 fill down and put it in a shell fabric of Carhatt style duck canvas the weight of the fabric would compress the down and render it much lower fill power. Smart companies like Rab know this and that's why they balance this with by using Pertex microlight fabric with 750 fill down. Ask yourself this which sleeping bag is warmer? A 0 degree synthetic bag A 0 degree 600 fill down bag A 0 degree 750 fill down bag A 0 degree 850 fill down bag They are all the same warmth because they are all rated to 0 degrees. The difference is in the weight of the bag and how compressible they will be. If you want to be warm~ look for a jacket with more down or more synthetic insulation. Look for companies to tell you how much down in grams is in the jacket. Examples: Rab Neturino Endurance: 800FP European Goose Down (250g/9oz in size L) Rab Zero G: 1000+FP R.D.S. Certified European Goose Down (130g/4.5oz size L) Rab Asylum: 650FP R.D.S. Certified European Duck Down (365g/12.8oz in size M) Rab Microlight: 750FP R.D.S. Certified European Goose Down (143g/5oz in Size L)  The Asylum has the lowest fill power but is actually the warmest of the group because it has the most down. (Neutrino will be close but thats because of its box baffle construction instead of sewn through but that's a whole other discussion.)      ,May 2014,Sep 27 2017,11

To wit~ I have a Thermoball and it's honestly pretty terrible. It's light~ sure~ but it's not as warm as any down or synthetic I own~ including that old Thinsulate parka. Hell~ it's not even as warm as the better fleeces I have lying around. This is not something you can evaluate based on paper specs. Thermoball is a highlight of the limitations of synthetic jackets~ it needs so much support it fails to loft properly and can never be used in substantial amounts this makes for a crappy jacket. I have a feeling the new pluma fill from Patagonia will have lofting issues under a waterproof shell since the video they put out said they used the absolute lightest shell to get it to loft~ being a continuous fiber it will probably be more durable than standard primaloft and should be able to be used in fairly substantial amounts~ strange that they needed to quilt a continuous fiber insulation though.. http://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/product/mens-micro-puff-hoody/84030.html",Oct 2015,Oct 16 2017,0
5052,Enough bullshit lightweight down jackets,4,7," Eddie Bauer and the like are great choices.  My personal choice is to drop the ""it's gotta be down"" mentality and spend <$150 on an arctic quilt lined Carhartt for this purpose.   This is what I was going to recommend. Won't make you like look someone posing for magazines like Rock and Ice or Climbing but gets the job done~ is cheap~ warm~ and ridiculously durable. I had one for years and used it for everything. When really cold I added a cheap hoodie and kept them together treating them as one beefy layer. Though plenty of other options if you love supporting climbing brands and have lots of expendable income.",Sep 2017,Oct 25 2017,0

It was the first time I stepped into the woods with it~ and it caught on the very first branch that I touched.

5059,Enough bullshit lightweight down jackets,4,14, Well that's not true at all~ I'm sure all those old nano puffy are garbage now.... Seb you should really learn about stuff before you talk. Actually - It's pretty well documented and even acknowledged by some manufacturers that repeated compression will reduce synthetic insulations effectiveness.  There are NUMEROUS threads over on BPL that discuss this.  I believe on one~ CS from Arcteryx wrote someone saying things like commuting in your car with a syn puffy on will reduce warmth quickly.  Those Nanos certainly will still work but they've probably lost warmth.  Probably to the tune of 50%  Link with data:  BPL Thread with discussion on loft lost Best Info -  50% is a clo loss plateau for short-staple synthetic insulations and it cannot be recovered. The first 30% occurs quickly and the next 20% a little slower. I have MUCH less lab test data for continuous synthetic insulation (two Montbell Thermawrap Pro Hoodies). No stuffing occurred in these tests. After two years of casual wear there is a 40% clo loss. It is interesting to note that the latest fleece versions (Thermal Pro) will also experience a maximum of 30% clo loss after approximately two weeks of conventional backpacking use. In contrast to short staple synthetics~ they will recover 100% of their clo value by vigorous shaking or fluffing in a dryer for a short time. Classic fleece doesn't experience a clo loss with backpacking use but~ its clo/oz is lower than an equivalent warmth Thermal Pro version. ,Jun 2006,Oct 30 2017,2

5062,My Ideal Climbing Pack - Is It Out There? ,1,0, I am on a hunt for my ideal climbing pack. I would really enjoying finding just a few specific features on one pack..   Features: Top loader PLUS alternate access to the main compartment (or a zipper that opens up completely)~ daisy chain and straps somewhere on the outside~ more pockets than just one main compartment~ padded waist belt.    Size: 35L-50L    Use: Climbing and camping at the crag - something that can hold quickdraws~ rope (preferably exterior to conserve space)~ chalk bag~ harness~ climbing shoes~ clothes~ sleeping bag (packs down pretty small)~ water~ and food. Some additional straps to secure my sleeping pad and tent would be fantastic.    I would like this to be my one-stop bag for days we are going to hike to the crag and camp. Most packs I see do not have a secondary access to the main compartment~ or they lack in complexity to organize gear properly while still being comfortable. I understand this pack may not be out there~ but any suggestions will be a tremendous help! Just putting the feelers out...   Thanks in advance!,May 2016,Jul 25 2016,0

5064,My Ideal Climbing Pack - Is It Out There? ,1,2, I bought the Patagonia Cragsmith 35l on a good sale + coupon from REI for $65 and it's been great.    Top access to main compartment~ full back zips away to expose the main contents~ decent sized lid pocket~ small pocket for keys and chapstick right at the top of the zip away back panel and a side guidebook pocket hold everything I need pretty well. Rope strap on top has worked well enough for a rope~ water bottle~ and jacket when the need arises.   It's been climbing~ camping~ and used as my only bag on a month-long cross-country trip while I was working (no climbing gear that time) and does everything quite well.    I really like the key/msc pocket~ the zippers that can all be pulled into basically the same spot right behind your neck and the make and materials seem great. Have stuffed it to the brim a few times and zippers were always solid~ thrown it face down in the dirt/asphalt/whatever more than a few times and it looks brand new except for where the webbing on the rope strap has fuzzed a little.   Padding is comfortable~ load lifters are nice. Daisy's are cool~ haul straps seem strong. Basically all its missing are a way to secure the sides of the rope hanging down but I just used the rope for that and it worked well enough.   Good buy~ I'm stoked on it.

5101,Mountaineering Boot Reviews,1,0, I'm in the market for a good all round mountain boot that will last as I move up through the WI and mixed grades and has the potential to be a good choice for expeditions in Patagonia. If I was deciding between the La Sportiva Nepal and the La Sportiva Gatura what would fit this description better? Would the Gatura be overkill? Open to suggestions for other boots as well~ these were just the standout boots. ,Feb 2011,Sep 11 2017,0
5102,Mountaineering Boot Reviews,1,1, Baturas are by far superior to the nepals in every aspect except durability. I've owned and used both and the difference is very notable. In particular~ the batura is lighter and warmer. If your looking for the superior option it's the Batura. If your climbing hard ice and mixed routes~ it's really only overkill if it's 20 degrees or above~ in which case you might find them too warm for the day.  While I haven't been to Patagonia~ they do seem to be the summer boot of choice for hard climbing down there. ,Jan 2014,Sep 12 2017,0
5103,Mountaineering Boot Reviews,1,2, I've also climbed in both the Batura and Nepals and agree with Max~ the Batura is lighter~ warmer and less durable. Besides the durability~ the Nepal also offers more ankle support than  the Batura~ which is nice if you are climbing lots of steep waterfall ice or front pointing up super long couloirs. For lots of walking or mixed terrain I prefer the ankle flexibility of the Batura.  The Batura has more or less been replaced by the G5 by the way. I just replaced my Baturas with the new G5s and have a few days in them. Compared with the Baturas the G5s are slightly lighter~ pretty similar in warmth and likely even less durable. I already had a Boa anchor fail. I'm expecting La Sportiva to warranty them.  I'm selling my used 44.0 Baturas for $250 if you are interested. I also have a pair of very lightly used 44.0 Trango Extreme GTX Silver Bullets(pictured below) for $225 or a pair of nearly new 44.0 Trango Primes for $200. If anybody is interested get in touch and I will get you some more photos.   ,Jan 2011,Sep 12 2017,0

5105,Mountaineering Boot Reviews,1,4, I don't think they make the baturas anymore~ but if I recall but I think they are actually an oz or 2 heavier then the nepals.  I use the Nepal cube~ which might be the best of both worlds for you.  Lighter and warmer then the standard Nepal~ and only a little more $~ they climb ice very well and hike great when lightly laced.  Never been to Patagonia~ but if the temp is nearing 30~ they can get a little too warm.  ,Mar 2016,Sep 26 2017,0

5110,Mountaineering Boot Reviews,1,9, Don't the Batura 2.0s and Nepals have the same sole? The rands and soles are wearing faster on my Baturas than they did on my old Nepals~ but if the new Nepals have the same~ then durability is moot. I don't have any durability issues with the uppers~ except perhaps negligible delamination. But I also approach and talus hop as much as possible in trail runners and switch out. Otherwise~ my Baturas were a huge improvement over the Nepals with respect to technical ability~ warmth-to-weight~ and feet staying dry. ,Jan 2011,Oct 30 2017,0

I own a Western Mountaineering bag and I would buy the same bag again if I had the chance. I have had my minus 30 degree bag for 8 years and I have had zero problems with it (and I use it at least 2 dozen times every year in very cold weather). Its warm~ the baffling is fantastic~ and the down has lost no noticeable loft in the years that I have owned it. Unfortunately~ you are going to drop $500-800 for a bag like this. Pay attention where you buy it~ because you can get a Western bag ""overfilled"" free of charge; essentially you are adding about 4-5 degrees for free. I have the Micro Fiber bag instead of the Gore DryLoft and I have never had problems with the down getting wet. In fact~ I think it is more important to transfer body moisture outwards than to keep moisture from soaking in and because Micro Fiber is much more breathable than DryLoft~ I think it is a better choice under most circumstances (and cheaper too). Furthermore~ if you are already using a bivy sack~ then having a DryLoft bag is really going to trap moisture and soak your bag.    However~ as others will probably mention~ there are other good bags out there. Feathered Friends and Marmot both make high quality down products. I would NOT buy anything from North Face; the worst bags I or any of my partners have owned have always been NF.",Jul 2008,Jan 4 2011,0
5114,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,1,2, Well~ it depends.   I've very happy with my Western Mountaineering bag (Puma GWS~ rated to -25) but it wasn't cheap. If you're on a limited budget and you don't mind something that's a bit heavier and bulkier you could consider a store-brand -25 bag from REI or MEC in Canada for several hundred dollars less.   Also~ there's quite a difference between a -25 bag and a -40. Are you planning an early springtime expedition to Denali or Logan?  If so then you'll probably want a -40~ but for most other purposes a -25 will be plenty warm (especially inside a bivi sack and a tent) and appreciably lighter and less bulky.,Jul 2003,Jan 4 2011,1
5115,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,1,3, Listen to what has been said.  Also keep in mind your Kelty is probably junk so don't judge ratings based on that.  If you are seeing 10 or 5 degree temps~ you don't need a -20 bag.  You should be fine with a 0 degree with a brand like Western Mountaineering or Marmot who are conservative on their ratings.    Also note tents~ bivys~ and sleeping bag liners are all supposed to raise (lower?) the ratings five or ten degrees.  I like to use a liner so body oils and dirt doesnt get into the down so I don't have to wash it as much.     And finally one way to make any sleeping bag luxurious when its cold out is to throw a hand warmer pack into the bottom.  Those things RULE.,Oct 2010,Jan 4 2011,1

Right now I have a Marmot and an REI synthetics~ both work well.   Winter sleeping tips:   - A bag is no good w/o a good ground pad.I use my crash pad.   - for winter/cold camping always: eat before bed to have extra calories to burn on cold nights.   -Change your socks before bed. Clammy damp socks will get you.   - While camping and have to Pee. Don't hold it in get out and Pee. Your body has to work to keep those excess fluids warm.   - Don't overdress for bed. Once you get a good bag let it do its job. Too much cloths can trap warm air from circulating.   - Camp where you will get morning sun.   Good luck in the cold. We love it.

5122,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,1,10, I've been climbing in cold conditions longer than I care to think about and the Marmot Col (-20F) has always worked great on Denali or in the Himalaya.  The Puma by Western Mountaineering is also a grat bag.  Western Mtng products are high value.  The down is the highest quality~ constuction is likewise.   Feathered Friends make good stuff also but I've had and also heard mixed reports with their bags.  The higest quality bags~ made from 900 loft down may not be as warm as they intend due to the down shifting and leaving cold spots.  On one of my trips to Pakistan everyone in my group but for two of us~ had FFbags and complained about them being a bit cold.  The two of us had WM and MM bags and were super warm.

5129,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,1,17, I'm a fan for down when it comes to sleeping bags. It's help me get away with using my Marmot in temps pretty far below my bag's rating. I have a long Marmot Sawtooth 15*~ and have had good luck in the Andes and in New England. Packs small and is light. I have a fleece summer bag that I now use as a liner and is comfy.

5132,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,1,20, I bought a Western Mountaineering Puma (-25) about 4 years ago when I started getting into back country skiing.  It has to be on of the best purchases I have ever made.  The quality difference between WM and Feathered Friends and the rest of the field is very noticeable when things go south on a trip.  I have had trips where it never gets above -40 at night and people I am with in -40 bags from other companies are having a real miserable time in the snow cave.

5137,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,2,4," The thing about a -20 to -40 bag is that the places most will use them you can get in a lot of trouble if the bag isn't up to par.  -30 or whatever is a whole different game when you are at 20~000' or so - you aren't making body heat the same way you do down lower.  So if you are buying this bag for high altitude - don't skimp - not even a little.  Email one of the Denali Guide Services and ask them what they like - those guys live in theirs for months at a time and should ""know"" what works.  Sleeping out overnight for the weekend in the Rockies and coming home to your hot tub is NOT the same thing as an expedition that lasts for weeks.  A good down bag should last for a very long time if properly cared for so the cost per year isn't really that bad.",Jan 2013,Sep 29 2013,0

I'll jump on the bandwagon and say that my Marmot Lithium 0 bag has been incredible. I've been comfortable doing bivies where the temp when I woke up was -20C.   Get your sleeping bag longer than you need so you can have room for your boots (or liners) and your water (sealed tight!).   +10 for a good sleeping mat. I think the best is the Thermarest NeoAir All-season. backcountry.com/therm-a-res…   I got the longer length NeoAir~ and when it is really cold I double it over in half~ lengthwise~ to double the insulation.

5145,Best cold weather sleeping bag?,2,12, For the past 25 years~ the original FF Widgeons have been my wife’s and my only year-round sleeping bags. We ordered rip-stop nylon shells instead of Gtex because I did not trust the longevity of the Gtex~ preferring to add a bivy shell when needed. They’ve been great for everything from +15C to -25C. Remove the collar and shift all the down to the bottom at the top end of the range and do the opposite~ adding the shell~ at the bottom end. The trapezoidal continuous baffles do a fantastic job of letting you shift the down and then keeping it in place all night long. Sure~ over the 25 years~ they’ve lost a bit of loft. They’re probably only good to -20C these days. We tried other options for our 2 older daughters. The two-bag option is pretty good : one bag good to just above freezing for summer use~ another good to -10C for fall~ spring and warm winter spells and both together for full winter. But I still came away convinced that we wanted to go back to the same Widgeon design for the 3rd daughter.   A couple of years before she would really start needing her adult-size winter bag~ I realized that somewhere along the way~ FF had stopped making the original Widgeon design. FF Widgeons~ like most other models on the market~ now sported the dreaded~ versatility-killing side-block baffles. Soon after~ we realized that Integral Designs had taken up the design for itself and was making excellent copies of the original Widgeon with only very minor tweaks). By the time we were ready to order~ we were horrified to realize that ID had stopped making down bags for the general public. We managed to get one as a special order. We were just camping by -5C a couple night ago and had to make sure that 2/3 of the down was shifted to the bottom to avoid being too warm.   A note on the MEC hybrid bags. They are touted as the best of both worlds but AFAIC they are exactly the opposite: short life-span of synthetic bags and terrible performance of down in wet conditions.,Apr 2012,Feb 3 2014,0

It's not going to be raining; and in my limited experience~ a down bag is fine with a week's worth of perspiration and condensation if you're moderately careful.   I've only been to 6800m in the Andes~ so this is an honest question: presumably you'll have a down suit (or at least a down jacket)~ why not sleep in that and layer it with a more modest sleeping bag? Do the cold mountains require sleeping in both a suit and a cold bag? Or do people not sleep in their down suit for whatever reason?   -Thanks.,Oct 2007,Apr 3 2014,0

5158,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,0, As several of us mentioned on a recent headlamp thread~ the headlamps made by well known outdoor brands tend to be far behind more niche brands like Zebralight~ Fenix~ etc~ and I usually recommend Zebralight. However~ the vast majority of climbers and outdoors people in general go with Petzl and BD headlamps simply because they are the most well known and most available in the major retail and online stores~ and some of them are very decent lights. Anyway I recently started working at a well known outdoor equipment store where we sell primarily Petzl and Black Diamond headlamps~ so I've been trying to learn more about the various models so I can give good advice to my customers. As much as a an obsessive flashaholic and light aficionado as I am~ and currently owning at least 4 headlamps and more flashlights than I can count off the top of my head~ I've actually never used a either a Petzl or BD light. I'm pretty familiar with the specs and features of the major models from each~ but I would very much appreciate hearing about the experience of people who have actually used them.  The models I'm most Interested are Black Diamond Spot and Petzl Actik / Actik Core~ since these are most similar in their feature sets~ and the ones I've been recommending the most as they seem to be the more versatile and solid headlamps with good features without going overboard with unnecessary frills~ but I'm also interested in feedback on other current models. I'm also interested in thoughts on the Petzl Reactik from anyone who's used it- while this is an expensive light~ the technology seems interesting and seems like it could either be a very useful feature that justifies it's price tag and simplifies operation~ or an expensive and potentially annoying gimmick.. The kind of feedback I'm mainly interested in is usability / interface (how easy is it to operate~ change modes etc~ especially for someone who maybe never used a headlamp before and is not necessarily very tech savvy)~ optics quality~ and realistic battery life- the numbers in the specs are meaningless as far as I'm concerned~ since as far as I know the lights are not regulated except maybe the ReActik~ and if a headlamp lists 260 hours of burn time an 3 AAA cells~ I don't believe for a second that' it's going to provide more than a few lumens at that point.. I'd especially appreciate hearing from anyone who owns or is very familiar with both the Petzl and BD lights and can compare them. Note that most of these lights have been significantly redesigned in the last year or so (2016 for BD I know)~ it's really the newer version I need to know about~ but thoughts on the older versions might be relevant also as I don't think the interface has changed all that much. Thanks very much in advance!,May 2014,Oct 9 2017,0
5159,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,1, To kick things off~ here are a couple of the key differences as far as I can tell between the BD Spot and Petzl Actik: Black Diamond Spot: Petzl Actik / Actik Core:,May 2014,Oct 9 2017,0
5160,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,2, FWIW I find the BD lamps (particularly the Storm) very unintuitive~ whereas the Petzls were pretty simple to use.  I know of several people who returned theirs for this very reason~ though I stuck with mine because I got it on clearance for super cheap and it works well enough once I remember how to turn the f’ing thing on.  I would recommend messing around with each in the store before pulling the trigger and making sure that you like the interface/functionality.  It’s enough that I would probably not buy a BD lamp again and would pay a bit more or sacrifice a few features for something that actually makes sense.,Jul 2014,Oct 9 2017,2
5161,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,3, A friend has the Reactik that was given to him as a gift and he constantly complains about the auto-dimming while caving.  I also don't understand why you'd put bluetooth in something to connect it to an app when you're actively dimming the light to save battery.  Seems like a poorly thought out design to me. I'd also make sure you explain how the lockout feature works for BD headlights.  Many people think these things eat batteries when they first get them because they don't understand the lockout.,Apr 2015,Oct 9 2017,1
5162,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,4, A friend has the Reactik that was given to him as a gift and he constantly complains about the auto-dimming while caving.  I also don't understand why you'd put bluetooth in something to connect it to an app when you're actively dimming the light to save battery.  Seems like a poorly thought out design to me. I'd also make sure you explain how the lockout feature works for BD headlights.  Many people think these things eat batteries when they first get them because they don't understand the lockout. I agree that putting bluetooth in a headlamp is absolutely absurd~ this is only in the ReActik plus version. I suppose being able to customize you brightness settings is nice for some people~ but I think that's making a headlamp way more complicated than it should be. But at least you can disable the bluetooth function.  The other nice think about the ReActik models are they at least have a lockout function (hold two buttons down together for two seconds)~ it's still not a true lockout imo~ but way better than what the other Petzls have~ which is nothing,May 2014,Oct 9 2017,0
5163,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,5, I can't speak to the new features and use~ but that is because I've had no problems with my BD Storm in the 7 or 8 years I've owned it. The light is still going strong and does everything I need~ which is mostly hiking/skinning on pre-dawn starts or late finishes for climbing and backcountry skiing.,Apr 2011,Oct 9 2017,0
5164,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,6, I'd also make sure you explain how the lockout feature works for BD headlights.  Many people think these things eat batteries when they first get them because they don't understand the lockout. Good point. Unfortunately I often don't have time to explain every feature of a product and also teach them how to use it~ but I try to touch on the major ones~ so they are at least aware that the feature exists and can read the instructions later to figure out how to use it.  Although the graphic instructions that BD and Petzl uses aren't easy for everyone to understand..  But that is good feedback~ I consider a lockout to be one of the most critical features on a headlamp~ and in general it's true that people often will own gear for years without even realizing some of the features that exist.,May 2014,Oct 9 2017,0
5165,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,7, I have used the new model spot religious since it came out. I spent some time deciding between the two the Petzl one mentioned above and the spot.  Im not sure on burn time I put rechargeable batteries in it and always seem to charge them so I have maximum brightness when I need it. I really like it for approaches in the dark and even find it plenty bright for night trail running. The only complaint is one time in the black canyon  I took a whip and my rope was around my leg while my headlamp was on my helmet~ and the headlamp opened and one of the batteries flew out thankfully we made it to the top just as the sun as a setting but really an overall great headlamp.  ,Mar 2011,Oct 9 2017,0
5166,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,8," I had always bought BD until last year when my BD headlamp (fairly new) randomly died in the middle of a 10-day hunting trip (ie leaving camp in the dark and getting back to camp in the dark). There are photos somewhere of me with my iphone strapped to my head in the middle of the night sawing off elk antlers (lol). Before that~ the same headlamp ""glitched out"" right before the Grand Traverse (a 40mi ski race that starts at midnight - thus light is pretty important!!) Fool me once... Anyway since those multiple frustrations I've owned a Petzl Tikka and it ROCKS. It never randomly turns on and uses up battery in my bag~ the brightness is great~ the battery life is great~ and the price point I believe was pretty nice. So Petzl all the way! I vowed after the BD nightmare to never buy their headlamps again. ",Jun 2013,Oct 9 2017,0
5167,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,9, I'm very turned off the Storm because of the red/green/blue feature. I know a lot of people like a red light~ but seriously who needs green or blue light?! I'm sure you can have some fun with it at camp~ or maybe come up with some kind of short-range signalling system at night if you have clear line of site~ but this is really superfluous for a serious outdoors headlamp~ especially one with only one button. When will designers learn that fewer buttons make devices more complicated to use~ not less?! If it weren't for the RGB light options~ I would just consider this the big brother to the spot~ with a bit more power and battery capacity~ and better waterproofing (the Spot is IPX8 waterproof~ but the battery compartment still gets wet and needs to be dried afterwards. The storm has the battery compartment sealed as well.),May 2014,Oct 9 2017,0

5172,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,14, I'll add that since you like the rechargeable feature feature of the Petzl Actic Core~ you might consider one of the 18650 versions~ and buying an 18650 cell with a built-in USB port. This would give you a similar experience to the Petzl~ with a much more powerful light and battery~ and also you're using a standard rather than a proprietary battery type. The downside is you can't use common disposables as a backup. For that you can use the AA version~ and use rechargeable AAs~ but you'll have a lot less power / runtime. If you have any questions that aren't answered in that thread~ feel free to ask. If I had to pick another brand~ Fenix would probably be my second choice. I haven't used any Fenix headlamps~ but I have a couple of their flashlights and they are very high quality~ with excellent optics. And you can actually find Fenix headlamps in some retail stores~ though it's still pretty uncommon. The HL60R has a built in USB port~ uses an 18650 cell (one is included with the light~ but it's pretty low capacity as far as 18650 cells go) with the ability to use a pair of CR123s as a backup. I prefer the Zebralights~ but I think you'd be happy with the HL60R. The one critical feature missing from most Fenix headlamps is that there is no lockout function. I have read some reviews stating that the Fenix HL60R can be locked out by unscrewing the tailcap (same as with zebralight)~ but Fenix does not mention this anywhere in their product description or manual~ so take that with a grain of salt. I know that other Fenix models~ even ones very similar to Zebralight~ can't be locked out this way because the threads are not anodized.,May 2014,Oct 26 2017,0
5173,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,15, So~ yeah~ both of those models have drawbacks. Though~ both are still pretty dang good in the end. I'm just demanding I guess. I wish my old BD Storm didn't die. Thanks for your thoughts. Since you have used both the Actik Core and the Storm (which I believe has a similar interface to the Spot)~ can you clarify a few things?: - When you say the waterproofing on the Petzl sucks~ do you mean because of the IP rating~ the construction~ or is it based on personal experience? - It sounds like you prefer the Petzl interface~ but do you have any other thoughts comparing the controls of the two? Aside from the 'power tap' feature which you mentioned~ and ignoring the blue and green modes (which the Spot doesn't have)~ which interface do you think would be simpler / more intuitive to use?,May 2014,Oct 26 2017,0
5174,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,16,,Dec 2012,Oct 27 2017,1
5175,Black Diamond vs Petzl Headlamps- In particular BD Spot vs Petzl Actik,1,17, Thanks. Interestingly the BD Spot~ while also IPx8 rated~ does not have a waterproof battery compartment at all. The waterproofing is between the battery compartment and the rest of the headlamp. So if it gets submerged the battery compartment will be flooded~ and you need to open it up~ take out the batteries~ and dry it out as soon as you have a chance. BD says it will still work with the battery compartment wet~ but obviously this is a less ideal arrangement.. I like the ideal of a secondary seal between the battery compartment and the electronics~ since any gasket could be compromised~ but I still think there should be an O-ring around the battery compartment.  One more reason I like the Zebralight and Fenix approach- just one round threaded opening that's easy to seal with an O-ring.,May 2014,Oct 27 2017,0
5176,Petzl ALTITUDE Harness Preview & First Thoughts,1,0, Recently~ I have decided to upgrade some of my older pieces of equipment~ and during this process I came to the conclusion that I wanted to upgrade my harness system too. Having used the Mammut Baffin harness for few years now~ I came to the understanding that such a bulky harness was not what I wanted to have anymore. Although the Mammut Baffin performed great so far~ I looked for less bulky and most of all for lightweight solutions. After extensive research on various harnesses from different high-end companies~ I decided to purchase the new lightweight harness from Petzl~ the ALTITUDE Harness. Read full review with many photos here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2017/10/25/petzl-altitude-harness-unboxing-preview/ As Petzl claims~ the ALTITUDE harness is an ultra-lightweightmountaineering/ski harness~ dons with feet on the ground. What is important to me is that no matter if you use it for summer or winter mountaineering~ this alpine harness will always suits my needs. From first look~ the ALTITUDE is very compact and on my scale weights 160 grams. The small size and weight of this harness will save space and load on my backpack which means I will be able to fit more items or to move faster on snowy slopes.  Another important feature is that I don’t need to take one foot off the ground when putting this harness on (crampons~ skis). Thanks to the Double Back Light buckle~ you can use the harness without taking your gloves off. Gear wise~ four lightweight gear loops offer space for carabiners and ice screws. For the latter~ Petzl has come up with a sophisticated solution: the leg loops are equipped with additional loops that keep your ice screws from swinging back and fourth on your legs. Though~ I have some initial concerns on how those gear loops are placed on the harness. Petzl~ decided to place the gear loops vertically and not horizontally as other traditional harnesses. Once I will have used extensively the harness~ I will report on this matter. A feature that has surprised me a lot positively about this harness~ is how thin and how comfortable it feels (at first use). I hope it will be as safe as Petzl declares to be~ because this harness is indeed “paper thin”.  Harness Donning and Set Up It is extremely easy to don the harness and the design is very intuitive. Without even reading the manual~ I was able to done the harness in the correct way and this is good from user experience and user point of view. Bellow some photos on how Petzl ALTITUDE looks like on a human body.

5191,LOWE ALPINE Mountain Attack 35-45 lt. Review,1,0, This past winter I was searching for a backpack that I could use it for 2 days (one night) trips to the mountain. This new backpack I wanted to have several features for winter mountaineering and to be within my budget. The previous years~ for such excursions I was using the Lowe Alpine Cholatse II 55-65 lt backpack. This backpack was great~ though the 55-65 litres where never filled up and therefore I did not want to carry extra weight and volume on my back. Read full review with more photos here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2017/05/30/lowe-alpine-mountain-attack-35-45-lt-review/ I have searched on several high-end brands such as Marmot~ Mountain Hardwear~ The North Face and even to the ultra light cottage brands such as Hyperlite Mountain Gear and specifically the 2400 Ice Pack. Finally~ the decision was made due to 50% discount offer on the Mountain Attack and I have never regret it.  I find the Mountain Attack to be a medium length fit. The strap adjustments are easy to use and the length of the back panel suits me well. The hip belt fit well~ was comfortable and the gear loops on the hip belt were the big~ plastic covered ones (similar to an actual harness) and could be used easily if needed. The shoulder straps are well padded and very comfortable even with heavy loads. I have loaded the Mountain Attack with full winter mountaineering equipment for a weekend (total 14 kg.) and I have never had any problem with the shoulder straps. Lowe Alpine describe this pack as a ‘a true all rounder~ the Mountain Attack is perfect for mountaineering~ hut to hut alpine adventures and winter ski touring trips.’  The rucksack is definitely well featured but~ although is has everything you want in a technical mountaineering pack~ I was delighted to see it has nothing more. The Mountain Attack has a single compartment which can be accessed either by a long side zip or the traditional top opening.  Lowe Alpine have used their lightweight and yet durable TriShield® Grid fabric for the main body and the well padded back panel features air mesh fabric for comfort and breathability.  The pack features Lowe Alpine’s ‘Adaptive Fit’ which is designed to allow the harness to cope with varying body shapes and it also has a removable frame.

5195,Salewa Ice Axe Tec X Hammer – Review,1,0, As winter is approaching it is about time to take off the cast and dust off one of the most crucial items of winter mountaineering~ the ice axe. Read complete review with more photos The Salewa Tex X Hammer Ice Axe is not the latest model of Salewa but is one of the most versatile models ever produced. The Salewa Tex X Hammer Ice Axe has ergonomic head with optimally balanced weight  for a perfect swing and placement. The 20° curve in the shaft makes sure the user can use not much power and deliver an outstanding stroke power.  The pick of the Tec X is aggressive and interchangeable made out of tempered steel. One of the most interesting features of this ice axe is the ergonomically shaped ProGrip shaft which also has a sanded print grip zone. This facilitates the user to have optimal control even in low temperatures and wet conditions. The curved shape of the shaft enables comfortable climbing on steep terrain which means the user needs to spend less energy on using this ice tool.

5196,Cumulus Panyam 600 Sleeping Bag Review,1,0, The whole past year~ I was looking for a warm high quality down sleeping bag for 4-season mountaineering~ hiking~ backpacking~ camping andother outdoor activities. I have been looking to all well established manufacturers such as Mountain Equipment~ Feather Friends~ Marmot~ Rab~ Montbell~ Mountain Hardwear etc. I have been comparing various models and I was still searching for other manufacturers until the point I came across the Cumulus website. I have compared several of their models and I came to the conclusion that the Cumulus Panyam 600 was the right piece of gear for me. Full review with more photos here: https://olympusmountaineering.wordpress.com/2016/06/30/cumulus-panyam-600-sleeping-bag-review/  The features of the Panyam 600 are the following:   My first feeling with the sleeping bag is more than good. It is lightweight and the construction seems to be solid. As soon as you take the sleeping bag~ off the storage bag you can see how easy and fast lofts. All materials used are of high quality including the YKK zippers as well. I also like the “orange” shade of the sleeping bag~ because on an unforeseen emergency~ the sleeping bag could be used as an emergency signaling element.

5200,Foxelli Headlamps,1,0," I wanted a headlamp that was:  - rechargeable    -- I don't like wasting batteries~ and it's nice to always have a bright light  - Li-ion or polymer    -- Other battery technologies are terrible in comparison    -- ... ok~ so the charge/discharge management of these batteries is a bit scary~ but there are many off-the-shelf chips that should safely manage that task these days.  - reasonably durable    -- obviously  - would not turn on accidentally    -- BD~ man~ those lights are incapable of staying off in a pack~ ""lock mode"" or not.  - lightweight    -- also obviously    After a bunch of hunting~ I couldn't find anything from the big climbing brands that fit the bill. Besides~ my ReVolt was horrendous. It would fail to charge~ die spontaneously~ turn on in my pack. That thing was a liability.  And then I stumbled into the brand ""Foxelli"" on Amazon. I got one for my wife~ and then got one for myself as well. Literally the only feature it lacks is a small red light for working around camp or in a tent. Its on/off button is stiff~ slightly recessed~ and on the side of the lamp. It's never turned on accidentally. There's a battery indicator light that glows green (usually) or red (if really low)~ and I'd recommend the black case light~ 'cause the green battery indicator glows a bit through the white case. It's a bit odd~ but no big deal.  Eventually~ after 2+ years of use~ the headlamp stopped charging and I contacted the brand. They sent me a new replacement lamp immediately. Moreover~ I should note that the defective light still has charge after multiple night runs; its failure mode~ while problematic~ was hardly catastrophic. I should also note that I tried their MX10 lamp~ which fell apart quickly and was replaced with a MX500 free of charge.  Long story short~ the MX500 listed on the link below is the best lamp I've ever owned~ and Foxelli~ whoever they are~ have been stalwart in supporting their products.  https://www.foxelli.com/collections/headlamps",Jul 2008,Sep 18 2017,0

5210,Foxelli Headlamps,1,10, I finally got fed up with shitty headlights from BD and Petzl a few years ago~ geeked out hard~ and settled on a Zebralight H600 MK II (it was before the MK III).   These lights blow everything else out of the water—no comparison at all—and it's so noticeable that five or six of my adventure buddies have dropped the $100 and made the switch as well.  Pros:  it's far~ far brighter (and far dimmer~ when I need it to be)~ it made of machined aluminum~ it's fully waterproof (I've taken it swimming)~ and it runs off a single rechargeable li-ion 18650~ which is roughly the energy equivalent of 4 AAs~ but much lighter.   Cons: it's about 1 oz heavier than average Petzl/BD headlamps (not comparable headlamps: they don't make comparable headlamps).  The other con is sorting through the battery shenanigans~ as 18650s come in many different quality-levels.  After a long talk with Zebralight~ and a few inferior batteries~ I bought a couple of their red ones~ which are Panasonic cells~ and have been extremely happy ever since.   For those that are curious on the deets: I chose the H600 because 18650s are the most energy-dense battery out there~ with the possible exception of Tesla's new 2170s.  That's why 18650s power everything from Makita power tools to Tesla Model S.  I started with the floody but then sent it back for the 80 deg spill / 12 deg spot~ which I found is better for climbing.  I went with cool white for the extra lumens (the MKIIIs hit 1300!).   Anyway~ yeah.  Hard to believe anyone buys those awful things from the climbing companies.   ,Mar 2013,Sep 27 2017,3
5211,Foxelli Headlamps,1,11, Jacon -  good beta~ thanks~ and I like that you geeked out on this. I like the 18650s - I recently got a flashlight with one and it's astounding how much light it puts off. But that's going to be a lot to carry around (I wouldn't carry a 4-AA headlamp around climbing~ so if that's what you're comparing it's not the comparison I'd make. I have typically used more like a 2 or 3-AAA version).  Thinking about it~ I'm not sure about the aluminum as a plus~ also - being a bit of a weight weenie something small and light is more likely to actually stay in my pack for when I need it~ and I have yet to break a plastic headlamp. It seems these may be overbuilt for climbing purposes~ or at least for mine? Did you look at any of the smaller offerings? How do they compare in weight vs. brightness to the climbing oriented offerings? ,Dec 2015,Oct 3 2017,0
5212,Foxelli Headlamps,1,12, Neither the Zebra light nor Armytek light appear to be appropriate for climbing.  The head/helmet mount looks like it would be easy to lose by bumping your helmet against the rock.  It is just snapped into a plastic holder.  I beg to differ. This zebralight has lived permanently on my climbing helmet for the past couple years. It gets beat up and banged against rocks constantly~ as well as tossed around on the way to crags~ and is non the worse for wear~ and never comes loose. I have the standard strap I just keep it extra tight. I haven't put my H603 on my helmet yet~ but the additional top strap (which would pull up against the helmet clips) and wider base should make it even more secure. I own a bunch of Zebralights and I think they are the best headlamps around by far.   ,May 2014,Oct 3 2017,0
5213,Foxelli Headlamps,1,13, I got a Zebralight a few years ago and was surprised how nice and bright it was. Lost it last fall and replaced with a Fenix - not much difference as far as I can tell. Guess I'm not bashing the backplate as hard as Seb! Rechargeable batteries work great in both.,Feb 2011,Oct 3 2017,0
5214,Foxelli Headlamps,1,14, I've been using Zebralights for years~ and I think they are the best headlamps available on the market. I love the simplicity~ durability~ lockout feature~ excellent optics~ and ease of battery changes (I can literally change the battery in the dark without taking it off my head). I currently own 4 different Zebralights (and I've lost a couple in the past)~ in a variety of battery types and beam angles~ so it might be useful to some of you to give an overview. They make a variety of models~ it really comes down to preference of what battery type~ beam angle~and color temperature you want. The biggest decision is battery type~ since there are pros and cons to each: Beam Angles: Note: One perk of this model~ which they don't advertise for some reason~ is that instead of a reflector~ there is a glow in the dark coating around the LED~ where the reflector would otherwise be. So if the light was on recently~ it glows fairly brightly~ making it easier to find. Color temperature: I won't get into this much as this post is already way too long~ but bottom line~ warmer is better. You sacrifice lumens~ but these lights are all plenty bright~ and you'll appreciate the nicer light quality more than a few lumens. Get the versions ending in 'w' - H53w~ H53Fw~ H603w~ etc. Bottom line / TLDR: Get the H53w or H53Fw if you want a great all-around headlamp that runs on simple AA~ with an option for lithium or recharegable~ and don't mind short runtime on high. Get the H600w or H600Fw if you want a longer runtime~ rechargeable option~ or want the brightest light~ and don't mind a bigger / heavier light. PS- A note about lumens: Humans do not perceive lumens in a linear fashion. The difference from say 50 to 100 lumens is much more noticeable than from 100 to 200 lumens- The brighter you get~ the more drastic the increase in output has to be for you to actually notice it. This is part of the reason there is such a huge leap in brightness settings from medium to high. The reason I point this out is to say that all of these lights will be very bright on high~ and the difference in lumens from one model to the next is trivial at the higher end~ and the beam angle is far more important in terms of perceived brightness.,May 2014,Oct 3 2017,3
5215,Foxelli Headlamps,1,15, Jacon -  good beta~ thanks~ and I like that you geeked out on this.

It seems these may be overbuilt for climbing purposes~ or at least for mine? Did you look at any of the smaller offerings? How do they compare in weight vs. brightness to the climbing oriented offerings?  Sure thing.  I'm a total weight-weenie as well (like~ Frankenpons with aluminum rear-ends and spectra straps~ etc. etc.).  I did break a few plastic headlamps~ which is why I appreciate the aluminum.  I didn't think about the smaller options because the 18650 seemed like the battery of choice.  I would never carry a 4 AA headlamp either.  My point is just that the 18650 is roughly the energy equivalent of 4 alkaline AAs~ but much~ much lighter.  The H600 I have is like 1.3 oz heavier than the Petzl Tikka (which I regard as sort of the standard always-carry headlamp)~ but it's infinitely more effective~ so that 1 oz is worth it to me.  I imagine I could shave it down~ too~ with smaller elastic strapping and no top strap.  ,Mar 2013,Oct 3 2017,0
5216,Foxelli Headlamps,1,16, You can even get an 18650 with a built-in USB port~ so you can charge it with just a standard USB cord. Dan~ Thanks for giving a detailed rundown of Zebralight options~ your research is appreciated. I can't seem to find any lights on zebralights site that have the USB charging option though. Can you point me to which models have this? This is the one feature that might convince me to pony up the cash for a zebralight as Jacon has been spewing about them for awhile.,Apr 2016,Oct 3 2017,1
5217,Foxelli Headlamps,1,17, After being enlightened this thread~ I picked up the Streamlight Protac HL. Wow~ it is by far the best headlamp I have had!! Super happy~ glad someone asked about it here - I have been carrying around sets of rechargable AAAs which stink!,Sep 2016,Oct 3 2017,0

5219,Foxelli Headlamps,1,19, Here are my couplefew data points for the brightness/weight/(and cost) curve:  Zebralight H53w 330 max lumens / 2.8 oz (79 gram) with an Eneloop AA battery and headband / $59H32 CR123 Headlamp Cool White  480 max lumens / 2.6 oz (74 gram) with CR123A and headband / $64 [don't see specs for the warm model on their site but probably similar]BD Storm  350 max lumens / 110 g (3.9 oz) with 4 AA batteries / $49  Zebralight H600w Mk III XHP35 Neutral White 18650 Headlamp  1126 Lm / 4.4 oz (124.6 gram) with ZL634 battery and headband / $89BD Icon 500 max lumens / 300 g (10.6 oz) with 4 AA batteries / $99 I get that I'm oversimplifying and overestimating~ have not looked at battery life at all~ the 18650 batteries and charger cost money~ and I have read zero fine print~ but by these simple metrics Zebra wins easily for me.  @Jacon - what am I missing based on your comparison - I don't see any weight penalty based on brightness? ,Dec 2015,Oct 3 2017,0

5221,Foxelli Headlamps,2,0, Fenix makes the USB port batteries: https://www.fenixlighting.com/product/arb-l18-3500u-built-in-usb-rechargeable-battery/ Unfortunately they are pretty expensive~ but you can usually get a 20% coupon for the direct store or one of their retailers. We had a few technicians using these regularly over the summer and they held up well.  Also not sure what model Seb had experience with~ but the mounting plate on my lamp has held up well for caving and other survey work.   ,Mar 2010,Oct 3 2017,0
5222,Foxelli Headlamps,2,1, One more datapoint:  I bought a H600 MkII this spring because it was discounted compared to the newer MkIII models. I bought the neutral white because it is supposed to improve depth perception~ but the cool white version is still available here: http://www.zebralight.com/H600-Mk-II-18650-XM-L2-Headlamp-Cool-White_p_130.html.  My previous / other headlights are a Petzl R+ and a couple of older aaa lights. Pros: - More compact when worn around the neck than the Petzl or even a standard headlight. I often wear mine around my neck because I try not to carry a backpack. - Fits on my helmet just fine~ even with the head strap. - Strong beam~ seems to illuminate to the end of a 200ft rap. - Way more battery life than I need for weekend trips (but i rarely use high).  - slightly-unscrew-battery-cap-to-lock is 100% reliable compared to the mechanism on my petzl (which isn't bad but sometimes doesn't want to unlock) Cons: - spot beam isn't the best in camp (it only has one led/lens unlike the R+) - heavy (but feels lighter than my other lights)  I actually got a 18650 light because I wanted to be able to use salvaged laptop cells (free and easy to find but be careful because they aren't protected) but this was totally unnecessary because it turns out I only need one battery.,Mar 2014,Oct 3 2017,0
5223,Foxelli Headlamps,2,2, My pleasure.   I don't think you're missing anything—it seems fairly cut and dried to me.  The two differences are the type of LED (ie~ Zebralight uses a single fancy Cree)~ and the battery type.  This is what I was trying to convey earlier: the reason I went with the H600 is because I think buying into the right battery system (18650s) is most important for an optimum weight/brightness and weight/battery life ratios.  The serious geeks at CandlePower Forums informed me that 18650s were the way to go~ so here I am.   Heh~ at this point I am starting to sound like a Zebralight shill.  I am sure there are other comparable headlamps out there (I've heard good things about Fenix). I just don't think climbing companies make any of them.   FWIW~ yes~ the batteries and charger add to the cost.  USB rechargeability was a minor concern for me~ so I bought a charger that accepts micro-USB.  I think the cost/performance ratio is far better for 18650s than Petzl's proprietary rechargeable batteries~ and moderately better than rechargeable AA/AAA (because those are much cheaper than the Petzl).   I don't really understand it~ but size is critical to battery efficiency (Wh/kg)—it has to do with overheating problems in bigger batteries (which is why they use many 18650 cells in Teslas and power tools~ instead of one big cell)~ vs. cost problems in smaller batteries.  Also surface-area-to-volume ratios (since surface area~ or the shell~ is obviously a weight factor~ whereas volume—the amount of lithium—is obviously a power factor).  Anyway~ 18650s are (or were) the most efficient.  Tesla now claims their 21700 (21mm x 70mm instead of 18x65) are better.  Anyway.  More here: http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/a_look_at_cell_formats_and_how_to_build_a_good_battery  ,Mar 2013,Oct 3 2017,0
5224,Foxelli Headlamps,2,3, I picked up a Wowtac A2S for $30. It has a USB rechargable 18650 and send pretty good so far.  The reviews on Amazon and YouTube seem good... Time will tell.,May 2012,Oct 4 2017,0
5225,Foxelli Headlamps,2,4, Dan~ Thanks for giving a detailed rundown of Zebralight options~ your research is appreciated.

This is the one feature that might convince me to pony up the cash for a zebralight as Jacon has been spewing about them for awhile. None of the Zebralights have a built-in charging option~ but there are 18650 cells available with a charger built in to the battery itself. You just remove the battery from the headlamp and plug in a USB cable.  The Nitecore NL1834R costs $20~ which is very reasonable for high quality 3400 mAh cell. The Fenix ARB-L18-3500U is $23 and 3500mAh. For comparison the most powerful 18650 on the market is 3600 mAh~ so you're not sacrificing any capacity for the USB port. Both are available on Amazon as well. Fenix and Nitecore both make high quality products. In this case I would probably go with the Nitecore~ since the Fenix version is a bit bigger (if the specs are accurate)~ and I'd worry about it being a tight fit. 3400mAh is still one of the most powerful batteries available.    ,May 2014,Oct 4 2017,0
5226,Foxelli Headlamps,2,5, Thinking about it~ I'm not sure about the aluminum as a plus~ also - being a bit of a weight weenie something small and light is more likely to actually stay in my pack for when I need it~ and I have yet to break a plastic headlamp. It seems these may be overbuilt for climbing purposes~ or at least for mine? Did you look at any of the smaller offerings? How do they compare in weight vs. brightness to the climbing oriented offerings?  The aluminum used in these lights is remarkably lightweight- my Zebralights as well as my Fenix flashlights all feel extremely lightweight once you take the battery out~ it almost seems like they're not made of metal.  I just looked it up~ and the Zebralight H53 is 31 grams empty~ 54 grams with the strap~ and 79 grams with strap and (NiMh) battery. For comparison a Petzl Tikka is 86 grams with 3AAA batteries~ and a Black Diamond Spot is 88 grams with 3 AAA batteries. The H600 is 39 grams bare~ 79 with the strap~ and 124.6 with an 18650 cell. The 18650 cells are heavy~ but don't think that the aluminum makes these lights heavy at all~ if anything it makes them lighter. The weight all comes from the battery. For the AA version (and any headlamp)~ you can reduce the weight by using lithium batteries. FYI the aluminum is also important for heat dissipation~ as these lights got hot on high.,May 2014,Oct 4 2017,0
5227,Foxelli Headlamps,2,6, By the way I'm a fan of Fenix flashlights~ they make some of the best ones available~ but most of their headlamps have one critical flaw- no battery lockout function. I consider this an essential feature and will not buy any headlamp lacking it.  On the Zebralights all you have to do is slightly unscrew the battery cap~ and the light cannot turn on by accident (btw this is a true mechanical lockout~ much more reliable than the Petzl and Black Diamond software lockout~ which involves holding down a button for 2 or 4 seconds~ which could still happen accidentally). On the Fenix headlamps~ even ones with a similar design~ they cannot be locked out this way because the threads are not anodized.  It's a shame~ because otherwise some of the Fenix headlamps seem very nice and would be a good competitor to Zebralight~ especially since Fenix is more well known and actually available in some retail stores..,May 2014,Oct 4 2017,0

5229,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,0," The Kong Slyde (less than $15 on Amazon) is a great alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust~ as it mimics its ""adjustable arm.""   Using a dynamic rope~ you have a very safe means to clip into an anchor and create a safe~ strong~ redundant rappel extension.   Kong recommends a 9mm diameter rope.    I realize not everyone is into this sort of method and will continue to use the rope or slings and other means to safely secure themselves to the anchor or extend their rappel.

5231,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,2, Well~ the $15 price is about the same as a good HMS Locking Biner for some of those hitches you mentioned.    Like I said~ it's not for everyone and there are clearly alternatives. But I think this method of using a dynamic rope and a self-locking adjustable plate is a great idea and I wanted to share it as a cheaper option to the Connect Adjust.

5232,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,3, I am curious as to what force it would take to make the Slyde slide.

When does the Slyde release and how much will this act like a screamer/ Kong Kisa? Just my pedantic curiosity~ since this is already the rig I use anyway.,Nov 2015,Nov 14 2016,1
5233,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,4, Does the slyde work with ropes thinner than 9mm? I have some 8.5mm half rope that I use as a teather but it's not set up to be adjustable~ so I was thinking about getting the slyde.,May 2014,Nov 14 2016,0

5244,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,15, I would call it less than ideal. You cant use lockers in a garda hitch~ the gates touching keep the carabiners from locking down. 2 non lockers with ropes twisted inside them leaves too many opportunities for failure. As long as the system stays tensioned~ there wouldnt be issues~ but as a personal tether~ i wouldnt risk it.,Jul 2011,Nov 15 2016,0
5245,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,16, This is the system I use minus the belay device for clipping into anchors and it is used widely in Spain as well (and maybe across Europe?)   I find it extremely versatile.  I believe my setup is with an 8mm static line~ the same you would use for hauling and it works great.  Having the adjustability is awesome.   I never used a PAS because they seemed clunky to me and all the extra loops seemed like they would get away.  When not in use~ the extra rope can be figure-8ed loosely to keep it out of the way.   Here I am using this in Spain: mountainproject.com/v/10882…   I do however recommend also clove-hitching your climbing line so you have two points of connection with your anchor on multipitches~ or using an extra single-length sling when cleaning a sport route. (you cant see my second tie-in point between my legs)   Look forward to seeing this setup more in the future at the crag! Thanks for introducing it!   cheers.   -chris,Nov 2006,Nov 15 2016,0
5246,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,1,17, Having the belay device attached (by clove hitch~ or knot) is great for when you are descending via multiple rappel stations.

I ave used one of these while aiding: kong.it/en/2-products/items…   Pretty much the same thing but weaker and a hook. I used it with 6mm~ thinner than recommended - occasionally it slips and I freak out until I hit the stopper knot   This failure mode with too thin cord is reminiscent of what can happen with guide plates where the top strand and bottom strand invert places.

5258,Kong Slyde~ as an alternative to the Petzl Connect Adjust,2,8,  After not finding a suitable configuration for the Kong Slyde on the net~ here is a photo and notes of my rigging. It is basically similar to the Petzl Dual Connect Adjust in configuration and use.  One thing I like about it over the Petzl is that the 9mm rope is passed thru both loops of the harness and not thru the belay loop.  The rope can also be replaced for a fraction of the cost of the Petzl while re-using the Slyde devise. So much better than my old girth hitched slings method.  I also simply clip the belay / rappel biner to the belay loop when belaying without removing it from the lanyard making the possibility of dropping the belay device near zero. So far so good!!!,Feb 2016,Sep 30 2017,3

Seems like you would have a strand just dangling while you're actually climbing.  As stated~ it is the same configuration as the Petzl Dual Connect Adjust.  When going on rappel for example~ you use the Slyde lanyard to anchor off while setting up the short lanyard with the rappel device.  Once securely on rappel~ un-clip the Slyde lanyard from the anchor and off you go.  I simply clip both ends to opposite sides of my harness when not in use.  So far they have not gotten in the way or been accidentally clipped.,Feb 2016,Sep 30 2017,1

On the one hand you might think I´m biased~ of course~ but I can also provide very good first hand info regarding the MegaJul (or any other Edelrid product).   Regarding availability~ right now your safest bet is mountaingear.com. They have the device in stock. Other vendors will follow shortly and the MegaJul will be widely available within April.   It also works very well when using it with half-ropes. You don´t need to have your thumb on the loop the entire time to feed out rope. You only use the loop to get the device out of the locked-mode. You can feed in the rope ""from-above"" (steep angle) without the device locking up. To do so you will need some practice but I do it all the time and it works great for me.   I hope I could clear some things up. Happy climbing!",Mar 2013,Apr 1 2013,0

5308,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,6, The MEC has been selling it for several weeks. Only one buyer review on their site so far and it's pretty discouraging. Among the issues mentioned~ the one that I'm most concerned about is that of wear being inflicted by the steel device on the softer belay biner. The reviewer didn't specify which biner he used. It seems unlikely that this was caused by using the device wrong (wrong handling or wrong kind of biner) because~ apparently~ he was able to return both the Jul and the messed-up biner (although MEC is usually pretty lenient with their return policy and they may not have checked if he used it correctly or they may have accepted the return despite incorrect use). Could it be a case again of some belay biners having the problem and others not? I certainly wouldn't want to have to try and find (let alone use) a steel belay biner to avoid this problem. Anyone else finding similar problems? The Smart has been around longer and I haven't seen this issue mentioned for it. I'm still trying to find time to take my own rope to the nearest MEC and try the Jul myself but I'm concerned that this issue of biner damage would show up only in the field and not in the store,Apr 2012,Apr 27 2013,0
5309,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,7, Yeah~ when I was doing the demos for it at OR in the summer~ it totally jacked our demo carabiner- we had to make sure it stayed with the device- knocked it up too much to be shown in other ways. I remember thinking it did a fair bit of damage for basically a show demo~ which shouldnt even scratch anodizing on aluminum. I dont think it would damage it such that it would compromise the carabiner~ but you'd definitely want to keep that carabiner dedicated and not use it for other things. I'd also expect a shorter life out of the carabiner.   The smart wouldnt do this~ as its made of aluminum.,unknown,Apr 27 2013,0

5313,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,11," The Mega Jul does scratch up your iodized biners. Your shiny carabiner will get scratches. Currently it is recommended to use the ""HMS Strike FG"" with it. It is a silver carabiner~ therefore you don´t really see the scratches. Besides that~ the shape of the HMS Strike fits perfectly into the Mega Jul. I haven´t heard of any case in which the biner had to be replaced because of the scratches. It is a cosmetic issue. You don´t have to dedicate the biner to the MegaJul. The biner is completely fine~ it is just an optical deficit.   Concerning the MEC Review:   The people who reviewed the Mega Jul used it for only one day. It takes some training to fluently use the device. To me their review reads like they tried the MegaJul without consulting the manual. The manual tells you that your biner will get scratches from the Mega Jul.    Here is a picture of a HMS Strike FG after five days of climbing with a Mega Jul on it.  HMS strike / Mega Jul / 5 days use   Edelrid is aware of the ""scratching-issue"" and will provide a solution to this in its 2014 product line.",Mar 2013,Apr 29 2013,0
5314,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,12, If the 2014 fix is developed on the side of the Jul~ I’d say that it’s almost certain that I’d buy one but if the fix requires buying a special Edelrid biner while the Jul continues scratching other biners~ I’d probably be a lot less enthusiastic.,Apr 2012,Apr 30 2013,0
5315,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,13, The fix won´t be on the side of the device.   As I said~ the scratches are the drawback of the device. Everybody has to decide for themselves if he can live with a scratched biner or not :-),Mar 2013,Apr 30 2013,0

5317,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,15, I'm using a mega jul and yeah~ the device wears off the anodizing in a few areas~ but by the time it makes any sort of gouge you should probably retire it due to rope grooves anyway.  I'd avoid using something narrow and soft like the petzl attache 3D~ but for the same reason it makes a poor belay biner for any device.,Sep 2012,May 1 2013,0

5324,Edelrid Mega Jul,4,2, After using the Smart and the Mega side by side for a while and doing large overhung raps on a variety of ropes I think both have their advantages but the Smart works better for general cragging. The Smart raps smoother~ is easier to belay a second~ and locks up faster. The Mega Jul works better with thin ropes (especially twins/halfs)~ is lighter~ and is easier to use as a regular tuber than the Smart.    The issue with scratching carabiners is bullshit.

5327,Edelrid Mega Jul,4,5, As I said~ I do actually like the idea of lock assist for belaying the leader.   Regarding the locked prusik issue~ this can only happen in extremely rare circumstances: me losing temporarily my hold on the brake strand and the second falling right at that time; or me losing consciousness and the second either falling or~ after realizing that I'm no longer taking in slack or responding~ locking the prusik by tugging on the rope~ etc.   Recovering from a locked prusik is going to be a non-issue most of the time. As soon as the second gets back on the rock~ tension on the rope will be relieved and~ if I am conscious~ I can just loosen the knot. If I am not~ the second will definitely want that knot to stay nice and tight. If the second just cannot get back on the rock after I've regained consciousness~ I should be able to simply re-grip the brake strand below the prusik~ lift the leg to release tension on the prusik~ pry the knot loose again and resume normal belaying (starting with lowering my second till he can get back on the rock).,Apr 2012,May 2 2013,0

5329,Edelrid Mega Jul,4,7, WTF~ do you lose consciousness on belay on a regular basis?

5331,Edelrid Mega Jul,4,9, Just an fyi- if you return the Jul to MEC~ they will have to destroy the device and will not be able to resell it.   I always hate it when I hear about people returning climbing gear because 'they dont like it' to REI/MEC- those companies basically have to eat the cost of that stuff as they cannot resell it nor can they return it for credit. In other words~ your 'trial' of the Mega-Jul just cost MEC the wholesale cost of the device. And that unit will be destroyed and thrown away.   It'd be way cooler of you to sell the device to another climber- someone who can actually use that device rather than it being thrown in the garbage.,unknown,May 3 2013,0

5334,Edelrid Mega Jul,4,12, Hey jktinst~   I´m sorry to hear the Mega Jul didn´t fulfill your expectations. Did you get a chance to watch the tutorial video (vimeo.com/53332541) or read the manual before you tried it? Or maybe a MEC store employee could have given you a quick clinic on how to use it? Also I would be curious to know what biners you have used when you tried the device out?   Have a nice weekend,Mar 2013,May 3 2013,0
5335,Edelrid Mega Jul,4,13, Well~ I'm sorry too. I realize that my expectations are pretty high and probably not entirely realistic. I'm basically hoping for something that locks (almost) as well as a grigri~ is about 10X lighter and less bulky and works with half ropes.   I had seen the video before and did look at and read the instructions. The salesperson didn't really know anything about the device (or about the Reverso either). I'm sure that if I had gone at a busier time I might have found a more knowledgeable person at the climbing gear counter but I don't think that it would have made a difference. I was really just looking to see how the device does at autolocking so all I did with it is belay a bit~ lock it down holding the brake hand and try to lock it down just yanking the lead rope~ as I had done before with the SA. For this~ pretty much the only thing I had to make sure of was that the rope was threaded the right way around through the device. The braking strand was dangling all the way to the floor and was piled up there so it was providing as much passive braking as it could.   Once I saw how it did with that test~ I was not interested in trying out any other functionality~ like belaying the second~ rappelling~ etc.   The biners I tried were the DMM belay masters 1 & 2~ Metolius Element~ Petzl Williams and an old DMM round stock pear biner with a plastic twist gate lock from the late 80s that~ incredible but true~ is non-anodized and all scratched up.,Apr 2012,May 3 2013,0

5342,Edelrid Mega Jul,5,0, There are indeed no truly hands-free devices~ but the Climbing Technology Alpine Up can (I did not say will) catch a fall completely unattended if there is enough rope laying around on the brake side; see youtube.com/watch?v=nFn4xzV…,Feb 2008,May 4 2013,0
5343,Edelrid Mega Jul,5,1, Well I have to say I really like the concept of the Mega Jul. I saw a video of someone demoing the device at a trade show a few months ago and have been excited ever since. I finally picked one up from mountaingear.com last week and took it out to the crag Friday and Saturday. I was really impressed with how well it fed rope and locked up after a lead fall. Rappelling with the thumb loop was a little bumpy but it was nice to have the device lock when reaching to pull a quickdraw from the wall.    Unfortunately the wire actually pulled out of the device near the end of my second day at the crag! I was lowering my climber by pulling the device up with the thumb loop and the wire just popped out. Luckily this didn't happen in the middle of a lead belay as I probably wouldn't have been able to feed any more rope to my climber. I was forced to use an extra biner to finish lowering in lever mode. I wonder if my device was just a dud or if this is going to be a serious problem. I certainly hadn't done anything that wasn't described in the manual or 'how to' video.    Like I said~ I think think the concept is solid but if Edelrid is giving the wire a function~ I'd like them to make darn sure it'll stay in place. Maybe I'll try again if they update the device for next year...   PS. Sorry for the blurry pictures...  Broken Mega Jul,May 2012,May 13 2013,0

They had to expect that kind of failure mode for this device~ so i assume something went wrong in their process controls.     I'd expect they'll send you a free replacement too.

5347,Edelrid Mega Jul,5,5, Not sure if this has already been covered in this thread but I couldn't read all of the responses...   On long rappels the device might not fully autolock once you get towards the end of the rope. I was lucky enough to get to test out the micro jul on 6.9mm twins and past halfway~ it started feeding through like a normal ATC would on rappel so keep your hand on the brake!   Overall a great belay device though. I will get one for sure.   Cheers,Sep 2006,May 13 2013,0

5366,Edelrid Mega Jul,6,4, Emmett~   Apparently there's a replacement coming next year.  I'm happy with mine after buying another biner with a very rounded cross section (plus a very small biner as a 'handle' for lowering on raps).  No signs of the wire pulling yet.,May 2013,Jul 15 2013,0

5372,Edelrid Mega Jul,6,10," I've been using the Mega Jul extensively and exclusively since May of this year.  I really like the device.  I was worried for the first week or so about the ""smoothness"" of the device for lowering and rappelling and given that the first two weeks of use was during a trip to Kalymnos~ the device saw a lot of both.     Here are a couple of thoughts.   The device for me seemed to have a break in period.  This was both because of the learning curve for the device~ as well as the polishing of the device.  I truly believe that after a week of use the device simply works better.  Not only did I learn how to use it~ but even my friends who used the device for the first time had no issues with lowering after the ""break in period"" (which for me was about 16 sport pitches)   The device is really at its smoothest with ropes under 10mm.  I've used the device with 8.5mm doubles and 9.5~ 9.8~ and 10.2mm singles.   For lowering the 10.2mm definitely takes the most pressure on the thumb loop~ while the other ropes all work very smoothly with little pressure.   Given that there have been some issues with the thumb loop breaking (not on mine)~ I've taken to using the biner hole on the inside of the device for rappelling on any rope and lowering with large diameter ropes.  This keeps me from putting significant pressure on the thumb loop and I find I really like the action better that way.  I'm at a point in the learning curve where I feel I can control descent as well as a grigri with the biner.     My last though is that I'm sure the next generation of this device will be improved (as all new products second generation are).  I'll certainly upgrade when the next generations product is available.  That said~ I have not had a friend try the device and use the device who hasn't been blown away with its simplicity and weight.   Almost all of them have either purchased a Jul or commented that their next device will be a Jul.",Oct 2011,Jul 17 2013,1
5373,Edelrid Mega Jul,6,11, Been using the mega and micro jul for about 6 months now.  These are by far my favorite devices ever.  Gave away my Smart Alpines.    Feeding out rope is effortless.  Assisted catch is great.  Light weight~ compact.     Can't think of anything better for an all-purpose belay/rappel device.,Jan 2006,Nov 10 2013,1
5374,Edelrid Mega Jul,6,12, Yesterday~ was rappeling with my microjoule~ and the thumb release came off.  Had to continue the rappel using a carabiner to release the device.   Not happy.   Have contacted Scarpa (USA Edelrid distributor)   Will see what they say.,Jan 2006,Nov 22 2013,0

5380,Edelrid Mega Jul,6,18, The mega jul does have some quirks.  I've found it great for inspecting/cleaning projects but I discovered last week that when doing this and getting chalk on the rope~ it locked up and wouldn't release without a great deal of tugging and bouncing.,May 2013,Nov 22 2013,0

5383,Edelrid Mega Jul,7,1, the president of Edelrid taught me how to use the device and lowering and rappelling were both done with the carabiner- they must have changed it between August of 2012 when I was shown the device (prototype) and March 2013 when the device was released to the public. I never got a sample to use~ so I never spent a great deal of time on it.   that being said~ I seem to recall the wire popping out of the prototypes toward the end of OR- i figured at the time since it was one of two in existence~ they just hadnt worked out the bugs. Surprised that a year later~ it seems to be a common failure mode. Oh well- i'll stick to my grigri2 for belaying and atc-guide for rapping~ thanks.,unknown,Nov 22 2013,0

When used correctly in accordance with instructions for use appear on the wire forces of up to 0.2 kN."" If the wires really have a separation value of 4.5 kN~ then there's no way that the force applied with your thumb should be able to pull the wire out of the device.  4.5kN is over 1000 pounds of force.

5393,Edelrid Mega Jul,7,11, It works like nothing already on the market. It takes single ropes from 13 to 7 mm~ double ropes also.   There is no spring into it so no need for a big pull to engage it. Also it makes it lighter.   Going down is super smooth.   So it may look a bit like a grigri but it sure is not.   I admit it is not like the MegaJul either... But its range of use is from the Micro Jul to the MegaJul.   Have you watch the demo (could not imbed it as it is on dailyMotion). You can take a look at my other vids.

5394,Edelrid Mega Jul,7,12," Franck~ very interesting. It kind of reminds me of the Wild Country SRC but with an additional moving handle rather than the handle being the frame of the device. ""There is no spring into it so no need for a big pull to engage it.""   How well does it feeds rope out to a leader (since you only show pulling rope in~ locking~ and lowering while loaded)?",May 2008,Dec 22 2013,0
5395,Edelrid Mega Jul,7,13, As long as you pull horizontally~ it doesn't lock. (It is said in the demo but in french)   Once you're used to it~ feeding rope is no problem.   If the leader yanks the rope sharply to clip~ it will block (grigri also). In that case~ you have to tilt the device and can give rope again.   If the leader falls in that specific case~ no problem~ unlike many accidents with the grigri when people grab it full hand to unblock it and feed rope.   I also use it for solo climbing~  self assured solo climbing,Dec 2013,Dec 22 2013,0

5413,Edelrid Mega Jul,8,11," Do you typically rappel in autolock mode?  I started out rapping in autolock mode~ but found that it was rather unpredictable.  Sometimes~ things were relatively smooth.  Other times~ the device locked up hard and it was difficult to make any downward progress~ even when cranking hard on a carabiner to release it.  Didn't seem to be related to rope width~ as it happened even when using ropes that were in the middle of the recommended width.

5419,Edelrid Mega Jul,8,17, I hate the way the Smart raps in 'auto' mode.  I reverse it and use it like an ATC for rapping.  I prefer a cord autoblock if I want a rap backup.,Oct 2010,Jan 7 2014,0
5420,Edelrid Mega Jul,8,18, When I say this concept is to me a big step forward~ I'm not talking about just the MegaJul~ but the Smart and any other lightweight~ versatile device that works for both belay and rappel on on single or double ropes and still catches the leader if the belayer accidentally lets go of the rope. Having seen climbers dropped~ belayers pass out from unrelated health issues~ and falling climbers hit belayers knocking them unconscious~a device that will still stop the lead fall if the belayer fumbles is~ at least to me~ a huge improvement.   For the rappel mode~ Mammut instructions suggest just what Matt N suggests above - rappel with the Smart not in autolocking mode~ but backwards so it runs smoothly and use a friction hitch autoblock backup like a typical device. This also works best with the MegaJul - save the autolock mode for belaying and rap smoothly with the rope threaded the other way. In this mode~ the MegaJul provides more friction than the Smart which is quite slippery in this mode~ making the MegaJul little better for my slow and nervous rapping style. Others may like the other better. Both devices are excellent once you learn them.  from the mammut smart instructions  Smooth rap mode from Mammut instructions,Sep 2007,Jan 7 2014,0

5424,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,2, Thanks Climber Pat~ the ALpine UP does look like a little more versatile version of the grigri~ but it looks to big for me to take up longer climbs. Even the Smart is almost as big as an extra hand sized cam. A slightly refined MegaJul-type device is what I'm hoping comes next - the size and weight of an ATC~ but with assisted catch and double rope rap capabilities.   And bearbreeder is dead on - none of the these devices should be considered hands off catches. Little things like your coat getting in the way of the device's rotation can prevent a full lock.,Sep 2007,Jan 8 2014,0
5425,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,3, What I found with the Alpine Smart was that the ropes tended to migrate from one slot to the other when belaying.  (Even when using ropes in the recommended width range.)  They would tend to get caught up~ forcing me to mess with them to free the snag.  In my experience~ the Jul devices feed much more smoothly~ which is one of the reasons why I abandoned my Alpine Smarts for the Juls.  (The other was the much smaller size and weight of the Juls.),Jan 2006,Jan 8 2014,0
5426,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,4, I've been using the MegaJul now for several weeks. I've used it on brand new Mammut Genesis (very slick 8.5mm doubles)~ an old fuzzy 10.2 Edlerid~ and a fairly new and slick 9.5 Mammut Infinity.   My observations: ,Nov 2009,Jan 8 2014,0
5427,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,5, Here is two tips for everybody who is complaining about the MegaJul´s rappelling properties:   - The standard rappell mode is using the device flipped (thumb loop pointing towards you). This mode always works smoothly. Back it up with a prusik. Rappell like with any other tubing device. I personally use this mode at least 90% of the time.   When should I use/can I use the device in auto-block mode for rappells?   - The device works smoothly in auto-block mode when you are using half-ropes.   - It works on single ropes~ too~ BUT only if the rope hangs totally straight. The rope must not run over an edge. When you thread it through the anchors it must be going straight to you - in a straight line. The less straight it is the more clunky it will be. In my personal experience this is crucial. One good example would be the rappell route on Castleton Tower.   I hope these tips will save you some time and hassle.,Mar 2013,Jan 8 2014,0
5428,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,6, Hi Moritz~ thanks for the suggestions.  I generally like the device~ but I'm still working out the kinks.  I especially appreciate that it is so lightweight and compact.   I do have one question that I haven't seen answered anywhere.  How strong is the device when being used to belay in guide mode (belaying a second)?  The tiny loop of metal is a bit spooky to me when compared visually to the beefy ring on an ATC Guide or Reverso.  I'm sure it's strong enough~ but I'm curious about the actual strength value when pull tested.,Nov 2009,Jan 8 2014,0
5429,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,7, According to prEN the loop has to hold 8kN (approx. 800kg). We have internally tested the loop for belaying the second climber in house with 13kn (approx. 1300kg).,Mar 2013,Jan 8 2014,0

5440,Edelrid Mega Jul,9,18, I picked one of these up this weekend. My Cinch was getting worn out and I didn't feel like spending the money on a new one~ so I gave this a try.   First impression is that it locks up awesome on a 9.5 while sport cragging.    Second impression is that lowering will take some getting used to. It can be picky~ and playing with carabiners might make it better. Right now I'm using a big Rock Lock which fits into the groove in the device perfectly. No creep when it's locked off under full weight.   Third thing I noticed is that you can feed it like a regular tube device~ but if it locks up because your leader yanks on the rope~ you gotta fuss with it to get it undone. If you just keep your thumb in the loop and pull up on it while feeding rope~ it throws rope really fast.   I'm going to give it a fair few months to see if I like it as a Cinch/Grigri replacement.   Headed to the Red this weekend~ so we'll definitely see how it does there.,Jan 2010,Apr 14 2014,0

5442,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,0, I've been following this thread for a while~ but didn't buy one due to the issues with the cable pulling.  Since it was identified that this was only in eary batches of 2013 I went and picked one up a few weeks ago.   I haven't been able to fully test it yet~ as I haven't belayed up a second~ but I've found this to be an excellent device so far.  Especially for lead belay since you can get the rope up to your leader as fast as needed.  Brake assist works very well as has been mentioned in this thread before.   All in all I'm very happy with the device so far~ but based on a home test I think the problems that people are having with belaying a second could change my tune a bit.,Apr 2013,Apr 16 2014,0
5443,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,1, I've only used it a few times so far for TR belay~ but it worked great with a new rope and an old locking biner. The newer Petzl attache didn't work as well as the other biner~ so you need to try a couple to see what rope / biner combination works best. Otherwise~ it worked quite well for me. It did not automatically stop every fall~ so keep your hand on the brake side of the rope :). Lowering was pretty smooth.   I'm pretty happy with this so far. It's not perfect~ but it's pretty good step in the right direction.  At least that's my initial 2 cents.,May 2011,Apr 27 2014,0
5444,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,2, I've been using one a few times a week for 8 months or so on single 9s~ double 9s and single 10s.  I like it.  I imagine my opinion would change if the cable suddenly pulls out.,Apr 2009,Apr 28 2014,0
5445,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,3, Hey! i just found this thread after buying a Mega Jul. I really like it (and do hold the break stand just like a good belayer should)~ but was wondering if anyone else has made the assisted locking-ness fail any of these ways:   1. Spinning to the small end of a belay carabiner (using an Edelrid HMS):   When the MegaJul spins to the small end of the carabiner~ it's often narrow enough to jam into the divots that help it lock. I could see this being a problem even on the wide side of some smaller HMS carabiners. ,Mar 2012,May 22 2014,0

5449,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,7, I spent some time with this guy at the Red~ and I still like it. It has see shortcomings and a little learning curve~ but it does what it's intended to do for me.   So far I like the Black Diamond Vapor Lock the best. Tried a Rock Lock~ cross section is too large to allow smooth lowering~ same for an Attache. The Edelrid HMS is nice~ but I've grown fond of the Vapor Lock.    With the Vapor Lock and a 9.5~ the rope will creep after locking up~ not a problem with the larger cross section biners for that rope size. That was taking my hand off when locked up though.   With the Vapor Lock and a 9.8~ the device locks solid with almost no creep if you take your hand off.   Feeding rope is good~ as long as you stay ahead of your climber. It's a bitch when it gets locked up trying to feed though. If you keep your thumb in the loop it's easy enough to over ride though.   All in all I like it. I'll stick with it for a while.   It's light~ simple~ and effective with the ropes I use and the proper carabiner.   UPDATE:   The vapor lock was slipping pretty good with some slick ropes so I switched to one of the new Petzl Attache 3d biners. That's the ticket.,Jan 2010,May 23 2014,0

5451,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,9, I've been using the MegaJul for a couple of months now and love it.  It doesn't do everything well.  As others have noted~ in guide mode it is too hard to pull rope through.  The fact that it is going to lock off if my belayer gets knocked unconscious by a falling rock or lets go for some reason is enough reason for me to want to use it.  We did some tests with one of my hefty climbing friends jumping off a top-rope with slack to simulate a trad fall and it locks off with no problem every time.  It even slips just a little rope through providing some dynamics in the catch which is critical in trad. If they could refine it to work better in guide mode it would be the best thing since sticky rubber.,Sep 2001,May 23 2014,0

5458,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,16, Hi all~   I tried the Mega Jul with a bunch of carabiners before ordering the one that Edelrid recommends for this belay device~ the Edelrid FG. It´s availible in a several versions~ all having the same cross-section geometry:  FG slider   Without this specific carabiner I couldn´t get the Mega Jul to lock single ropes even when using an old fuzzy 11mm rope. With the FG-carabiner~ I like the device a lot. I mostly use it for multipitch trad climbing.   Cheers~   Mats,Aug 2014,Aug 12 2014,0

I wouldn´t say rapping on a fuzzy 11mm rope works well~ but I rarely do it and the advantages outweigh the drawbacks in my opinion.

5475,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,13," Ray~ OP~ said ""The Megal Jul does not seem to conduct heat.""    That's the only thing I thought I'd comment on. I've been using the Mega Jul for about 6 months now and it is great!    But a warning on the device getting SUPER HOT. If you are sport or top roping~ lowering someone from a climb higher than 15/20 feet. That device is going to get pretty darn hot. Maybe it is because I tilt the device like a lever instead of pulling up and out on the thumb loop (which I found to be less smooth than simply tilting the device toward me.) When lowering this way I have to wear a glove on my left (non brake) hand. My left hand comes into contact with the stainless steel of the device~ and the devices frame being so skinny - that metal heats up pretty easily.    I also have a question for anyone experienced in multi pitch climbing with the Mega Jul. I've tested it a few times just rigging it up at home. When I'm pulling in slack for a second climber (using a single 9.5mm) it is pretty difficult to pull rope through. IDK if this is just always the case when belaying a second? I've heard the ATC Guide is actually worse and the Mammut Smart is the only device that you can pull rope through more easily. If anyone has any pointers I'd be glad to hear them. I'm pretty much having to use two hands to pull down on the rope otherwise my shoulders get blasted.",Jul 2015,Dec 9 2015,0
5476,Edelrid Mega Jul,1,14, I had occasion to rap with the Mega Jul a few times last week~ on a less-than-ideal-for-the-purpose 10.1mm rope.    In locking mode~ paired with an Edelrid Strike biner~ I couldn't actually get it to unlock.  With a DMM Rhino~ it works reasonably well~ as long as you have a small biner to put in the center hole and use as a lever.  With a BD Rocklock it was better still.  I think the Strike and other biners with a square-ish profile lock too well for use with fat ropes.   In non-locking mode it's quite nice~ giving lower friction than even the toothless side of a DMM Pivot.   In either case it gets seriously hot~ and chews up the finish on the biner you use it with. If I had a skinnier rope I'd be inclined to use it all the time but given the rope I've got now I'll stick with the Pivot or Reverso.,Jul 2015,Dec 19 2015,0

5502,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,0, Does the Mega Jul or any of the other sliding-biner assisted belay devices (e.g. smart~ click-up...) lock up if the rope strands are held parallel to eachother.  I know that is not the proper belay technique for the Mega Jul or any other belay device.  I'm just curious.,Mar 2015,May 10 2016,0
5503,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,1, I've fooled around with my Mega Jul~ trying to get it to fail and not lock~ and it did lock with both strands parallel. If you feed really slow (not like in a fall) it wont lock~ but a quick movement of the rope and it seems to lock no matter what.,Oct 2015,May 13 2016,0
5504,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,2, Has anyone had a problem with their megajul slipping excessively? I rapped yesterday on a single line in locking mode~ and it basically didn't lock up at all~ I actually had to redirect off my leg loop to control it. Rope was a 9.4 trango   I've also noticed it slipping more and more when belaying. I use the edelrid HMS biner~ and it's getting grooved~ but not excessively. It's a little concerning considering how well it performed initially.   I wonder if it has to do with it being sensitive to biner cross section.   I have been using it a ton for sport climbing~ probably 2-3 weekends a month~ but don't use it in the gym.,Jan 2010,May 23 2016,0
5505,Edelrid Mega Jul,3,3, climbing friend~   this is a device most holy~ with everything you heart desire - auto braking assist dare say locking~ double rope rap~ cheap~ light~ guide mode belay.    Do not be thinking of the funny stuff. You must use a fat~ round~ pear shaped karabiner~ or you rope it will get kinked or produce excessive friction for you device.    However~ using device may not be socially accept~ because in their heart any good climbing friend of the climbing rocks sport climbing for rock~ would only trust the grigri~ and this would look too much like the deadly ATC.,Jul 2014,May 23 2016,0

I was belaying from above and it just broke. There is a lot of corrosion between the cable and the main body metal~ from what happens with corrosion caused by different types of metals in fixed anchors I would say this is galvanic corrosion. It doesn't help that the plastic is there in a way it just seems to keep humidity inside.    I really like the way it works and now I'm totally disappointed...

It's good that people read different perspectives. My reference to you as a user~ is as a Mountain Project user~ not MegaJul. I know you don't like this device. I respect that even though my own experience has been different with it. The only time I've ever noticed either the Megajul or the Alpine Smart Belay not move into the locking position is if a hand is not on the brake strand and there is not very much rope on the brake strand side. That does though go completely against proper usage.  Edit: I took out the word user in front of your name in my prior post realizing it is probably confusing to some people. ,unknown,Apr 28 2017,0

Also mentioned somewhere was a case where the karabiner had turned around and the small end went into one side of the MJ preventing the rope from locking. I know of another case where with the normal Smart where the handle became hooked in the belayer jacket where it was bunched up in the harness and failed to lock. All things which could have been avoided but weren´t. Both devices naturally enough don´t lock up in FF2 anyway but this is mentioned in the instructions.,Nov 2009,May 1 2017,0

5542,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,1,17, An approach shoe is non of the above. No approach shoe is rugged~ they all fall apart or the sole wears away after 3 months of daily use the only shoe i haven't heard durability issues from is the arcteryx hiking shoes these guys have fairly sticky rubber but they are about as far from affordable as you could get. IDK what a reliable shoe is (one that doesn't walk away?) The cheapest approach shoes on the market are cruzers~ they are also the most fragile pair of shoes on the market~ after that there are no cheap shoes they all cost about the same. All this being said the la sportiva hyper mid has served me well though i have babied the sole to avoid wearing down all the lugs limiting use for woodland and dirt tracks to the crag I imagine the sole might last 5 months of daily use before the lugs are flattened to nothingness~ still better than the tennies i had before that~ they wore through in 3 delaminated after 6 and had a giant hole in the side by 8. They have bought out the hyper line of shoes again as a low top~ they climb pretty well and have a sturdy sole (really thick base rubber).,Oct 2015,Sep 20 2017,0
5543,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,1,18, Seb's response is spot on. If you want a robustly designed~ supportive approach shoe~ you're going to pay approx $100+ for it. The Evolv Cruzer is lightweight and cheap~ but it's also the least durable shoe you can buy~ and has a comical amount of support - I think I gave myself a stress fracture in my big toe using them. I am totally happy with the level of support the guide tennies provide (tried them up to approx 15 mile days)~ but agree with the posters that mention sturdier shoes that may do better on long days with a pack. Your best bet is to pick two or three shoes you would probably be happy with~ and keep an eye out for sales/ebay deals. I'd strongly recommend against the Evolv Cruzer~ almost any other approach shoe will do better in every category but weight.,Mar 2009,Sep 20 2017,0

5546,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,0," I disagree with the ""won't holdup to daily use"" statements. I work in an office~ but I get out on a lot of lunch break and after-work romps up what is approach shoe terrain for me - so I wear my cruxes to my day job on an almost daily basis. I often use them when I'm guiding on weekends as my climbing shoes~ which saves me transition times at belays. I've carried a huge (60+ lbs) back into the back country with a great deal of elevation gained and lost over a dozen or so miles on rough trails~ and then used them ""for the purpose they were built"". I've worn a pair of lightweight crampons on them for short sections of snow. I've even~ in pursuit of contrived Devil's Lake speed challenges~ run in them from route to route with a light pack or rack and rope. No~ they won't last a hundred years under that kind of daily abuse~ but I get about 14 months out of a pair of the leather version at that rate~ and really couldn't expect much more than that. And~ maybe most importantly~ I think they climb fairly well.",May 2002,Sep 21 2017,0
5547,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,1, Hello!  I am looking for a pair of approach shoes that will be comfortable and durable enough for me to wear walking around in on a daily basis~ and also won't break my wallet. I was looking at the la sportiva boulder x and the scarpa geckos and scarpa crux but they are a little out of my price range. I was hoping to get some crowd-sourced information on the durability and comfort of your favorite approach shoe.  What do you expect to do in your approach shoes~ when you aren't walking around town? If you are not planning to climb in them on at least some easy roped terrain~ like guides do~ you don't need shoes with special sticky rubber. Just go to Sierra Trading Post~ and search for trail running shoes on sale. They might even have approach shoes on sale~ too...  I have a pair of Guide Tennies ( that i got for $45)~ it isn't my first pair~ and each pair had lasted at least 2.5-3 years. I also have a pair of 361 trail running shoes~ again~ bought on clearance online. They are lighter-weight~ very comfortable~ and I like them for hot weather/dry terrain. But because they are mesh~ they soak through with the dew in 5 seconds of walking on grass~ while leather guide tennies do just fine with the dew.,Mar 2011,Sep 21 2017,1
5548,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,2, The LS TX2 is a well designed and constructed approach shoe. The overall design strikes a balance between supportive and thin + tactile~ which translates to moderate climbing ability~ moderate hiking comfort~ and moderate packability. They aren't hiking shoes though~ so far downhill hiking still gets my knees pretty sore. They aren't much heavier than the Cruzer~ but they certainly don't pack nearly as well. The Cruzer is completely unstructured which allows it to completely collapse.  The sole design and sticky rubber on the TX2 improve climbing ability so steep scrambling is a pleasure and moderate climbing with edging is doable.  They have held up quite well in about a year of use with several long + steep + dirty approaches through a variety of terrain such as light snow + ice~ bush~ mud~ river~ talus~ and common hiking trails. I haven't done any dedicated testing in exceptionally demanding conditions.  In general I would recommend against using approach shoes featuring sticky rubber for day to day use~ especially on pavement or concrete. The sticky rubber will do its job and wear out fairly quickly.   ,Mar 2015,Sep 21 2017,0
5549,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,3, The ones I've got are purpose specific and in my quest for a good match to my needs I've picked up a few different models as they pop up for cheap. A key point is that you can almost always find any of these shoes for at least 40% off if you are patient and search a bit. Comfort level for anything depends on how strong your feet are and what kinds of loads and distance you expect to deal with.  I tend to overpack my trad gear and so for those approaches (usually around a mile+ or so each way through wooded trails) I like something with more support. Sportiva Boulder-X is a comfy scrambler~ although not a great climber. At the other end is the Adidas Terrex which are thinner and comfy but not really up to heavy loads. Maybe it's just where I've taken them but I'm not impressed with their edging ability at all~ although they are a bit on the sticky side. I've also got some older guide tennies that were good once I traded out the insole with something a bit better - the originals made my feet hurt and were not supportive at all. Still a bit hard to walk far in but then again my feet are a bit sensitive for various reasons. The boulder-Xs are my go to shoes now but are huge and not a great idea for carrying up climb - the Adidas would be a great choice for multipitch+hike off. My guide tennies are now pulling primary duty as flat MTB pedals and are great for that. Really though~ the Adidas are more like a cheap pair of trail runners than hikers and you could get away with whatever is cheaper unless you really want something sticky.  At some point I also picked up a pair of Ganda's for cheap but have been sort of saving them. They are by far the best climbing approach shoes I've ever tried but they are not the most comfortable for any sort of hike unless you keep tweaking the toe box laces - really loose for the hike~ tight for climbing~ which is too much of a pain to deal with for most things. Sort of mid-weight.  That said~ I have developed a bad habit of wearing the Adidas around town... they look sharp and are very comfy day-to-day.   ,Jul 2009,Sep 21 2017,0
5550,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,4," Save for the La Sportiva TX series. I hiked the entire John Muir Trail and some change in my TX4s~ and they held up wonderfully. A few months later~ and they're still my ""daily driver"". I anticipate many more miles of use from them. They have great arch support as well. ",Jul 2015,Sep 23 2017,0
5551,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,5, Evolve cruziers = Tom's with slightly sticker rubber. Right now the lightest option minus sandals to hang on your harness.  LS TX2 = Lightweight approach shoe on the softer side. Pretty rad daily driver but lacks a little in true climbing ability since it's so soft. This is what I'd bring if you want an actual approach shoe that you'd have to hang on your harness when you use real climbing shoes (like NWF Half Dome in a day).  LS TX4 = Imo the best true approach shoe that you can actually hike and climb in right now. (not sure how/if the mesh upper of the TX3 effects the fit~ but it's the same outsole and midsole). The last that they are using on the TX series is really nice in that it allows your foot to splay a bit more but don't have a bunch of room up and down so it's still precise. TX2~ TX3~ TX4 all share the same last but all fit slightly different due to tooling and upper construction differences (the TX2 fit a tiny bit smaller than the TX4) 5.10 Guide Tennie = Use to be the best before the tx4 came around. I don't know why people complain about the durability. I got a resole out of both pairs of mine before the heel counter broke down. And yeah no shit the rubber wears down faster than your regular shoes~ it's f-ing climbing rubber. 5.10 Ascent = The best looking (imo) casual looking but still performs amazing approach shoe. Not as a good of a hiker as the Tx4.  Scarpa Crux and Boulder X = heavy~ and stiff as shit. Just like all leather hiking boots they are a hold over from an older time.  Adidas Solo (this guy) = STIFF ass shoe but not heavy and looks decent. Because they are so stiff they edge amazing~ but you have to wear them properly tightened or you will get bad blisters on your heel (this is a known problem). The new ones might be a touch softer.   Vibram Megagrip rubber is pretty legit (it's in the TX series) but most trail runners with Megagrip have lugs that are too tall and will deflect when actually climbing. I know Croft digs worn down trail runners for approach stuff since the lugs don't deflect (and they are generally cooler~ temperature wise~ than approach shoes). ,Oct 2011,Sep 24 2017,2

5553,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,7, Scarpa Crux are the best approach shoes I've ever had.  Comfy right out of the box.  They are similar to the old Guide Tennies (before Five Ten went and fuck'd em all up).  The first time I wore mine~ I wore them on Wham Ridge on Vestal Peak.  I used them to pack in a heavy load~ and for the climbing.  They were equally comfy for both~ and soft enough to climb well on endless slabs.,May 2008,Sep 24 2017,1
5554,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,8, I'm not sure which model they are~ but I've been wearing my Mammut approach shoes as a daily show and have put many miles in the mountains for more than a year now. I've also climbed a handful of routes in them and am thouroughly impressed with the rubber. They have hardly any wear and are extremely comfortable. ,Nov 2014,Sep 24 2017,0
5555,Best rugged reliable affordable approach shoes,2,9," Adidas Solo (this guy) = STIFF ass shoe but not heavy and looks decent. Because they are so stiff they edge amazing~ but you have to wear them properly tightened or you will get bad blisters on your heel (this is a known problem). The new ones might be a touch softer.   The Adidas Terex Solo linked above is a GREAT shoe~ but that version (in the link) hasn't been made in years. The new version is way different = much lighter~ more flexible~ less rugged~ etc. The new version is better looking version of the previous version of the Guide Tennie (the older~ softer lighter version) and Terrex shoes use Stealth rubber. It is a cool shoe but too soft for me to use for approaches with a heavy pack.  The Adidas Terrex Scope GTX is more like the older Solo but is even stiffer and has Gore Tex. I think the Scope GTX is an awesome approach shoe for long approaches. It is very durable. Its downsides are it is relatively heavy and may be a lot stiffer than many prefer - which results to the excessive heel slip that NorCalNomad mentioned (although this can be reduced/eliminated with fancy lacing technique). The thin~ lightweight laces on all Terrex shoes are a joke and need to be replaced immediately = lame. The Scope GTX is popular among guides in Europe but basically unknown in the US which is weird since it ticks all the boxes for me - Stealth rubber~ GTX~ well made~ durable~ stiff~ climbs great~ good looking~ etc. Basically a much better quality Five Ten approach shoe made by Adidas.  Adidas shoes are relatively easy to find on sale but I still recommend that the OP rethink what ""affordable"" means. A $75 shoe that falls apart in a month is a rip off. A $160 shoe that I have four seasons on is still going strong is an incredible deal (I just bought my second pair of Scope GTXs even though I didn't really ""need""). Approach shoes take a ton of abuse and need to be good at many things.  Slightly off topic - I have decided that I can live without Stealth rubber on all my climbing shoes (I still vastly prefer it) because rock climbing is a slow~ precise activity and on something like granite - the grippiness of rubber is less critical. But I think it is required on approach shoes since~ on the same trip~ I may be smearing up approach slabs~ jumping across a stream crossing on wet boulders (no other sticky rubber comes close on wet rock)~ running down a boulder field or snow slope~ etc. Stealth is just way better across a variety of surfaces especially when moving dynamically.  ",Apr 2014,Sep 25 2017,0

I'd say for most approach shoe duties having GTX makes the shoe worse as it makes it hotter (making your foot more damp)~ heavier~ slower to dry~ worse fitting~ and more expensive.   But if you are talking GTX approach shoes... The North Face actually makes my favorite GTX approach shoe~ which you can't get in the states~ which is the Verto Amp. Legit climbs really well~ has plenty of cushion~ and is light. ,Oct 2011,Sep 26 2017,0

5558,Grivel Clepsydra S (grgri),1,0, If you're not familiar with grivel's twin gate biners: http://blog.weighmyrack.com/grivels-twin-gate-carabiner-review-sigma-k8g-lambda-k7g-mega-k6g/ I've used a grivel plume biner to attach my plate/atc in guide mode for a few months~ it's incredibly light and compact. It's much lighter than other auto locking biners (I don't consider the edelrid strike series for this application~ you can press their lock open against the rock) and more importantly you don't have to worry about screwing a gate shut ever (by pitch 15 in a day that matters). The plume is awesome for a guide device~ but the wire gate is too wide for the hole on a grigri. This was also the case with the black/gold solid twin gate biners in grivel's line up. Enter the Clepsydra S with a narrow outer wire gate~ it's clear this was designed with mechanical brake assist devices in mind. It features a rib on the spine~ ala DMM rhino~ to keep your belay device from sliding down the spine. The angle which the gate meets the nose of the biner also keeps the device from sliding down onto the gate. The wire/solid gate combo is very easy to operate~ it's easier to get the gates open than on the black/gold solid gate models.  For normal belaying I see anti-cross loading biners as somewhat of a gimmick. I hate the BD gridlock's multiple gate actions and edelrid requires you manually pull out a wire and futz the biner in place. Grivel did a better job here~ the wire is pressed open as you pull the biner out against your belay loop~ far faster and easier than the others. It does have a downside though~ for multipitch when you clip the grigri to a gear loop it drops down and gear loops goes into that captive portion. That means fishing around behind you and pulling the wire open to lift the device up~ then you can open the inner gate to get it off your gear loop. If I were just doing regular lead belaying I would still cut the belay loop keeper wire out~ but it serves a very good purpose for me: SIMUL CLIMBING. If you adjust slack as a follower using a grigri this biner keeps the device oriented well. It makes it easy to instinctively reach down and adjust slack with one hand without looking. Not a huge difference~ but I found it easier to manage the rope w/o looking down after switching to this biner. For a grigri~ lifeguard~ matik~ etc.. I think this biner is perfect. I'm not sure how well it would work with a vergo because the small side of the biner is about the same width as my belay loop~ not much room to let the biner rotate 90 degrees.  ,Jan 2015,Sep 6 2017,0

5563,Ice Tools,1,0, Hi~ I just started ice climbing this past year and am working on finding gear of my own and am looking for my first pair of ice tools. I have only used BD Vipers in the past so I don't really have much experience in comparing tools. I know I don't want to start straight shaft tools (like old Charlet Mosers). I'm currently going to college and don't have much to spend on a set so something cheaper but still good. I've been looking at the Grivel X-Monster and Cassin All-Mountain. Any recommendations or review of those tools? I've also been scouring the sale forum for used tools but like I said~ I don't have much experience on what to look for. Thanks in advance. ,Jul 2017,Aug 15 2017,0
5564,Ice Tools,1,1, I had the All-Mountains for a while~ and they are great tools.  They are good for exactly what the name says.  If you are looking into doing waterfall climbing rather than alpine ice~ I'd recommend something like the X-Dreams.  You can often find them for under $200 a piece new.  ,Mar 2016,Aug 15 2017,1
5565,Ice Tools,1,2, I can 2nd the Cassin X-all mountain. If you wait to find them on sale or look for used one's here you can usually pick up a set for $200-$250 or so. They work really well on low angle ice and solid up through WI-3/4. The X-dream's are really nice too. Those are the current tools that I use and just provide a nicer handle and the ability to change the angle to improve performance on mixed and overhanging ice terrain.  I've used the Grivel X-monster and honestly they'll get the job done~ but they aren't very nice to use. For the small bump in price the X-all mountain would be much preferred. I don't like any of the current BD ice tools. Fuel has a nice design but are such a pain to clean (pull out of the ice) that I grew to curse them when I demo'd them. ,Aug 2011,Aug 15 2017,1
5566,Ice Tools,1,3," You're in the Northeast per your profile~ so if you're planning to do most of your climbing locally it'll be steep-ish waterfall ice rather than long/easy snow + occasional alpine ice. I would get a pair of tools with the ""ergo"" style handle. One can certainly climb WI5+ with any modern tool but these just feel a bit nicer on steep stuff. The Petzl Nomic is the prototypical example and probably the most popular. X-Dreams are also well-regarded. They're both 25% off at Backcountry right now~ sign up for ActiveJunky for an extra 7%. For even cheaper than that~ the Trango Raptors are similar and have gotten some favorable reviews. I have several tools and the ""all-around"" tools (I have Quarks~ similar to X-Alls) have mostly turned into loaners even for days playing around on easier ice. ",Sep 2013,Aug 15 2017,0

It's just a difference of where the shaft is curved. The end result is the same effective angle. Also~ the x-dream is the same angle as the x-all mountain when it's set on the ""ice"" setting for the handle. The ""rock"" option moves it closer to the angle of the Petzl Ergo~ which is I agree is easier on WI-5/6 and mixed terrain. That more curved shaft and handle sure makes it easier to hold on when climbing long sections of really steep stuff. The x-all mountain will work well on everything up through WI-4. They really shine on WI2-3. Which is what a new ice climber will be climbing for the first few years. ",Aug 2011,Aug 15 2017,0
5568,Ice Tools,1,5, The Quarks are much less aggressive than the All-Mountains. They are more akin to the X-Lights. (All good tools~ they just excel in different things.) ,Mar 2016,Aug 16 2017,0
5569,Ice Tools,1,6, I think the handle is as important as the angle when selecting a modern ice tool~ though there does tend to be a direct correlation. I agree the angle of the X-All is more aggressive than a Quark and that can be nice for mixed or clearing ice bulges but I think the ergo handle makes a big difference in not only that but how comfortably one can hang on for prolonged periods and match~ and most people would prefer a Nomic for steeper climbing. Despite the differences in the head/shaft I think most people would use the Quarks and X-Alls for similar purposes~ likewise for the Nomics and X-dreams. So I think those are the fairest to compare within Petzl and Cassin's offerings. To me the X-lights are more akin to the Sum'Tecs.  Everyone is different but I think plenty of beginner ice climbers who are already competent rock climbers TR higher grades than 2-3 early on around here with the easy access to WI~ essentially roadside in many cases. I'm not sure he'd gain much by starting with less aggressive tools in this environment. And he's on a student budget for the near future so he'll struggle with the financial aspect of upgrading. So for mostly northeast waterfall ice cragging I say go for the Nomics or X-dreams.  He'll be happy with whatever he gets obviously. Any tools are better than no tools and most all these climbs were put up with straight shafts.,Sep 2013,Aug 16 2017,0
5570,Ice Tools,1,7, OP - get boots first~ as those usually can't be borrowed. Then get crampons (vertical frontpoints for Northeast ice cragging)~ since there can sometimes be issues fitting to boots.  Tools could be last on your list~ as you will (presumably... hopefully) be climbing with experienced folks who should let you borrow their tools. The benefit of this is that you get to try the tools we're talking about here. X-Dreams~ to cite an example~ have a unique curve on the back of the grip that some folks don't like (compared to the classic grip shape of the Nomic). Trango Raptors are a super sweet tool; not as popular as the others (primarily b/c they haven't penetrated the retail and Ice Festival scene) so harder to demo them. Their grip is a bit smaller than the others which can be a selling point for folks with smaller hands. You are smart to avoid old tools. I agree with the comment above that if you're a competent rock climber you'll be spending at least a little time on 4+ terrain (on toprope of course) rather quickly. But let me add that you likewise should avoid tools that are optimized for overhanging drytooling (Petzl Ergo~ BD Fusion). These are noticeably more difficult to learn to swing on moderate ice. ,Jul 2009,Aug 16 2017,0
5571,Ice Tools,1,8, Thanks for all the advice! My main climbing would be in NY inthe Adirondacks and maybe some exploring in the gully's and waterfalls or the Finger Lakes region. I've already got boots and crampons (Scarpa Phantom 6000 that I found for $260 as display modelsand were the best price I could find for a mountaineering boot in size 48~ Petzl Lynx crampons that a guy tried once but stuck with his BD crampons). I plan on sticking with TR for a while and I my first climbs have been in the WI2- to WI3- range. It seems like many people like the Cassin X-Dreams. I'll have to keep my eye out for deals on those. ,Jul 2017,Aug 16 2017,0

5574,Ice Tools,1,11, What are some options for boots to pair with Cassin Blade Runner Cramp-ons? This is the wrong order: boots should fit your feet; your crampons should fit your boots (and the terrain).    That said~ they fit MBP fairly well: http://www.thealpinestart.com/2015/09/long-term-review-scarpa-mont-blanc-pro-gtx/,Nov 2012,Aug 16 2017,1
5575,Ice Tools,1,12, +1ing what others have said.... be realistic about the amount of alpine you will be doing. Even if alpine is your ultimate goal~ other partners will generally be hesitant to drag you up a long alpine climb until you are more experienced or lead. If you are new in the NE~ 90%+ of your climbing will be toprope ice cragging on steep WI4-5 (this is my personal experience over the last 3 seasons). For that I'd recommend nomics or x-dreams.  Also.... buy boots first~ then crampons (cyborgs/lynx made a huge difference over my sabretooths)~ and lastly tools. ,Feb 2016,Aug 16 2017,0
5576,Ice Tools,1,13, +1 to the advice above. However~ the Blade Runners are extremely adjustable and I'd struggle to imagine a modern boot that they wouldn't fit. I did spend like 2 hours dinking with them to fit my Baturas though.  I've got a 2nd pair if you are looking for a cheap set. They have been used literally once in an ice crag. ,Mar 2016,Aug 16 2017,0

5578,Ice Tools,1,15, I had All Mtns before I decided ice climbing is shit and thought they were nice tools~ similar to Nomics but a better swing. I found they're terrible for alpine though because the bent shaft makes for an awkward plunge. Nomics plunge better and I suppose there's a reason they're so popular.  But you should get boots first and most crampons are good enough. Blade Runners are pretty heavy for alpine... ,Feb 2014,Aug 31 2017,0

I ended up going with Cobras - with just their tiny bit different geometry they plunge much better. You may want to check out the Grivel North Machines. I just played with them earlier today~ they were pretty darn sexy for alpine. ,Mar 2016,Aug 31 2017,0

5588,Ice Tools,2,4, Since you asked about xmonsters but didn't get much... I've climbed on them a few seasons along with other tools. They are heavy~ which isn't necessarily bad~ very burly and durable~ actually climb snow fine for approaches (not good for tons of snow climbing obviously) have a decent swing~ and have good clearance. Only knocks are the difficulty of changing picks (won't need to do this very often) and that the picks shift for me when matching on the upper handle in ice. I'd sell mine for a decent price if you are interested. ,Jun 2006,Aug 31 2017,0

5591,Arcteryx Aperture Chalk bag,1,2, I tried one on in size large.  The bag itself is very long but the actual chalk-holding component is only about the bottom half of the bag.  This means that half of the size/depth is wasted~ and also that you have to reach down extra far to access the chalk~ which I strongly disliked. Instead~ go with a Tufa chalk bag; it is my favorite.  Solid materials~ good construction~ good ergonomics~ great capacity. https://tufaclimbing.com/products/houdini-chalk-bag ,Sep 2011,Aug 31 2017,0

5593,Five Ten - Approach Pro Review,1,0,"   Background: As a former gym employee and routesetter I am slightly embarrassed to admit the number of approach shoes that I've purchased over the years. La Sportiva Boulder X~ Five Ten Guide Tennie / Aescent / Freerider / Warhawk~ plus probably 3-4 pairs of Evolv Cruzers... the list goes on. Obviously 'Approach shoe' is a weird category to begin with... almost all of the actual (1 hour+) approaches that I've done have been completed in my La Sportiva Wildcat trail runners since I'm usually much more concerned about slipping on scree / gravel (and of course~ not getting blisters) than I am about being able to edge precisely. While the lack of sticky rubber isn't ideal~ my Wildcats are plenty tacky and I've always figured that I can throw on my actual climbing shoes if I run into a death slab. After years of trying to figure out what role an approach shoe should fit~ I figure that all I really want out of an approach shoe is something that can pack up to nothing and is soft enough to prevent blisters while still being able to edge/smear somewhat decently.  For the aforementioned reasons~ I never actually use any of my approach shoes outdoors with the sole exception of my Evolv Cruzers~ which I use fairly often for multi-pitch when I don't want to stash anything or leave stuff behind. While the Cruzers aren't fantastic climbing shoes I've still found myself climbing entire multi-pitches up to 5.10 in them - I've always loved how light they are but have lamented the fact that they were just too soft to do anything but smear. All of the other shoes are either too stiff to hike in (blisters) or too soft to climb in (can't edge). People seem to love the Guide Tennies~ but in my eyes they've always felt too stiff to hike well and too clunky to climb well - a true master of none. The Cruzers seem to strike an acceptable balance between the two - they're too soft to edge in but the softness allows me to size them tighter without getting blisters~ which gives me better overall rock performance than a clunkier but stiff shoe would on most easy~ slabby climbs. I'm definitely not going to go out and hike 10+ miles in them~ but like most climbers I have pretty strong feet and have hiked 4-5 miles in them without getting any blisters or feeling the need for more support. However the Cruzers have another major downside - I've never had a pair go more than a few months without a major rip~ usually right on the outside edge of my foot. The canvas is just too thin and fragile - they're like a pair of Toms with sticky rubber. So I've been keeping an eye out for a pair of approach shoes that are still light / collapsible while having a little bit of reinforcement to keep the rips at bay and hopefully tighten up the edging a tad. Enter the Approach Pro.   Initial Observations: While the Approach Pros are not as light as the Cruzers (15.4 oz vs. 19.5 oz for a pair of size 9's)~ they seem significantly more durable and edge much better than the Cruzers. I've only owned my Approach Pros for a few months but I have been wearing them 5 days a week (plus 2x/week to the gym for the past couple of months... since I messed up my back and can't bend over to lace up my normal climbing shoes!). While I can't ""edge"" per se in my Cruzers (it's more like 'smedging')~ my Approach Pros will actually edge on small-ish (1/4 pad) footchips~ which is something that none of my other approach shoes have even come close to doing. I might just be lucky with the sizing~ but they're ultra-comfortable too... they have a respectable amount of foot support and are stiff enough to edge without my toes needing to touch the front~ but soft enough to walk around in all day without getting blisters. Best part is~ over the past few months of near-daily wear they still look almost-new and show no major signs of deterioration.  Conclusion: Once my back heals up I'm excited to throw a pack on and see how these hike~ but my initial impressions have been very positive so far. They're lightweight~ relatively durable~ pack up small~ and can actually edge somewhat decently - everything  I want in an approach shoe. While these definitely don't rival the performance of a true climbing shoe~ I've been edging confidently on 5.10 / 5.11 feet and can easily see myself leaving my climbing shoes behind entirely on easier multipitches or traverses with these shoes. I haven't seen many review of these yet so figured I'd throw my initial impressions out there - if anyone has put these through a more rigorous test please feel free to chime in and let me know your thoughts!   ",Sep 2016,Jul 26 2017,2

5597,Five Ten - Approach Pro Review,1,4, I've been using a pair of these for the last couple of months and absolutely love 'em.  I run in minimalish zero drop shoes and decent ground feel (merrell trail gloves~ VFFs~ etc) and most approach shoes are kinda the opposite of that.  My favorite approach shoes used to be the Patagonia Rovers (no longer available)~ which were basically a cross between a zero drop trail runner and an approach shoe.  Decent rubber~ stiff where it mattered~ sensitive~ etc.  The Cruzer is nice in theory~ but doesn't really fit my wide forefoot and doesn't really climb all that great.   The 5.10s fit me great in my street shoe size (half a size up from my 5.10 climbing shoe size). Enough room in the toe that hiking is comfortable~ rubber that grips really well on steep wet rock~ wears well on pavement~ enough lateral stiffness to edge but flexible to hike in~ close enough to a thin+zero drop sole.  Tradeoff to the durability is that the upper is thick so they get a bit warm in the summer and don't dry super fast if they get soaked.  Great all-rounder. Climb well~ hike well~ look like normal sneakers and comfy enough that I wear them around town all the time.  My son and I have been trying to find all the best cracks between buildings and in parking structures and these are my secret weapon.  Silly fun to have something so close to a legit climbing shoe that I can wear to the office on friday.  :-P,Oct 2015,Jul 26 2017,1
5598,Five Ten - Approach Pro Review,1,5, Great info~ thanks for sharing. How do you size these compared to the other approach shoes you've owned? Also~ what is your foot like in terms of sizing? I'm a dead-on 11.5 d/e on a brannock device~ and the 11.5 Approach Pro fits me perfectly - toes not quite touching the front when my feet are swollen but they probably would be if I put on a heavy pair of wool socks. Fit seems very slightly roomier than my Cruzers~ but very slightly tighter than my Aesents.  It's honestly hard to compare fit to the Guide Tennies or Boulder Xs because those shoes are so much stiffer and I need to lace them tighter as a result. The heel is pretty form-fitting on the Approach Pros so honestly I've never needed to fully tighten them down (even when climbing) so in a way that probably makes them seem more comfortable then they might be if I had to really cinch them down. I don't know if that makes sense~ but it feels like the difference between putting on my ice boots vs. putting on a pair of normal tennis shoes... I expect them both to fit differently so its hard to directly compare.  And likewise Pat - I wore mine to the office today and have to admit they're a low-key good looking pair of shoes. I never thought I'd get compliments on my approach shoes from non-climbers~ but go figure! ,Sep 2016,Jul 26 2017,0

5601,Five Ten - Approach Pro Review,1,8, Had mine for around a month before they were torn on both shoes right around that rubber piece that sits on the outside of your foot.  Used them on a trip up to the Perch and a few days of 3rd classing was the death knell.  Lasted shorter than my Cruzers which only lasted a few months as well.   I think there is no getting around the fact that these lightweight approach kicks will be destroyed if they ever actually touch rock.

That will pay dividends over just buying high top shoes. Current mid and high cut shoes aren't stopping your ankle from rolling~ they are helping to secure your foot (the navicular and heel in particular) to the footbed/midsole which makes your foot more stable.

5610,Butora Mantra wide shoe review,1,0, UPDATE: See 1-yr performance review below. tl;dr - Just buy a pair of downsized Mythos.  I have big feet. Wide feet. How wide? If I weren't nearly six feet tall~ someone might accuse me of being a hobbit. So wide that most models from most brands won't even go on my feet~ let alone be something I can climb in. Various recommendations have been investigated (Scarpa Vapor V~ TC Pros after stretch~ whichever Scarpa was designed by the Mythos designer after he changed companies~ and so on). For the first 6 years or so~ my daily driver were Evolv Defys~ but I eventually said to hell with the big toe pain the shape of the toe box led to and switched to Mythos. The rest was history~ until I heard that some new models and new brands had come to the US.  After checking out a lot of these new shoes at gym demo nights~ and finding out a shop not too far away was carrying brands not available in my current city~ I drove over to try all the wide model Butoras. After homing in on size and width~ I bought a pair of Mantras to see if they could function satisfactorily. After climbing in them 4-5 days per week for about two months~ both gym and outside~ with one lightly sprained ankle (unrelated to shoes)~ I wish I had just bought another pair of Mythos. Why?  1. My usage pattern is to wear the shoes for hours at a time. I'm not going up a multi-pitch and taking shoes off every pitch. I'm not going to unshoe/reshoe between every route at the gym. Velcro shoes are awfully convenient~ but they are nowhere near as adjustable in fit as lace-ups. Mocs/slippers of any sort are just right out.  2. These are hemp-lined shoes. They don't smell like feet~ but the lining is developing an odor funky enough for George Clinton to appreciate.  3. To paraphrase Jimmy McMillan~ the soles are too damn thick. I can't feel what I'm doing nearly as well as I could in either Defys or Mythos. Incentive to work on foot placement~ but it makes it a lot harder to trust my feet. The shoes may be built to support me well in edging~ but soles are so thick that I'm fighting to accurately place my foot on that edge to begin with.  4. The rubber just ain't sticky. I've been finding my technique degrading as I rely more heavily on my arms to compensate for feet when they start sliding off little edges and nibs that I could easily handle in the Mythos. They work OK on slab~ but smearing... In general~ modern climbing shoes should stick to the hold~ not slide around like sueded dance shoes on a good floor (or worse~ the sloper next to the second clip of Piledriver).  5. Despite the significant adjustability of being lace-ups~ I find myself regularly fiddling with the lacing and shifting feet while belaying in order to maintain blood flow to my toes. I know I have ultra-wide feet~ but I just never had this issue with either Defys or Mythos. It's definitely too late to return the Mantras~ but since I generally like to have two pairs of shoes~ so the next pair will go back to the old standard of comfort.,May 2016,Jul 20 2016,0
5611,Butora Mantra wide shoe review,1,1, Sounds like you've got the same problem I do...impossibly wide feet. Thanks for the good review. I guess i need to try on another pair of mythos...,Apr 2009,Jul 20 2016,0
5612,Butora Mantra wide shoe review,1,2, Nice review. I agree the mantra is stiff. I like my wide mantras and believe the rubber to be comparable to C4. Definitely a stiff shoe but if you buy them~ you should know what you are getting.   I've been wanting to try the Butora Altura (mid-top) and bought a pair from Rock and Resole but had to return for exchange and the new size is apparently lost in the mail.  Folks at Rock and Resole are awesome and sending another pair. I hope they arrive somehow.,Oct 2011,Jul 20 2016,0

5614,Butora Mantra wide shoe review,1,4, Anything is going to feel stiff after wearing mythos. I think mythos are a one of the lowest performing shoes out there~ they are bad at almost everything except cracks.    Not sure why you discounted moccasyms or another slipper~ they would probably be the most forgiving.    Also would suggest you reconsider your refusal to take shoes off between pitches or routes. It really doesn't take that long. I find the upside very worth it.,Nov 2006,Jul 20 2016,1

5616,Butora Mantra wide shoe review,1,6, Circling back now that I've had these for over a year. It's a bit weird to have a pair of shoes that have lasted a year. Not surprising~ but weird~ and I've definitely had other shoes that wore down more quickly for the same amount of usage. But on to the long-term review... 1) The shoes have become more pleasant as they've broken in some. This came about because I needed to replace my cheapo gym daily drivers (Cypher Prefix) and wore these for a few weeks until the new Prefixs fit in my budget. 2) I've found a use case where I enjoy the stiffness of the soles -- the small foot jibs seen on lots of gym boulder routes. At this point the Mantras are my go-to for gym bouldering.  3) The funky smell eventually dissipated into a less offensive odor as I used them more. Way less offensive than anything year-old from Evolv would be.4) Stickiness still not on par with~ say~ Stealth C4~ but eminently reasonable. Honestly~ learning to use better foot placement and body position have been more important than how sticky the rubber is (still not interested in soloing a Flatiron in roller skates though). 5) In hindsight~ I'd say that the blood flow issue may be due to more to my foot changing shape than the shoes. In the last year and a half I've started peak bagging~ as well as doing time in a retail environment~ and it definitely affected my foot shape a bit no matter what shoe I'm wearing.,May 2016,Aug 27 2017,3

5621,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,1,4, Yeah~ you want a soft~ preferably flat~ durable shoe for training.  I've seen a lot of people in the sharks~ actually...supposed to be pretty comfortable for something completely covered in rubber.  Personally I'm into Moccs/Anasazis. As far as the original choices: as the above poster said~ very different shoes.  The Instincts will climb more like your Solutions or even Miuras~ whereas the Magos are much softer.  You'll get more edging power out of the Instincts and be able to grab holds with your feet on overhangs better with the Magos.,Jul 2014,Jul 3 2017,1

5633,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,1,16, I'd say so~ yeah.  For me it was the ankle that was the problem on the Solutions (same with Miuras).  A lot of Sportiva shoes create huge pockets in that area for me~ which was why I downsized so aggressively~ but you can get away with it in the Solutions since they're fairly soft.  The Anasazis are pretty baggy in the heel~ although the heel on Pink is much better if you are ok with laces.,Jul 2014,Jul 4 2017,1
5634,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,1,17, I'd say so~ yeah.  For me it was the ankle that was the problem on the Solutions (same with Miuras).  A lot of Sportiva shoes create huge pockets in that area for me~ which was why I downsized so aggressively~ but you can get away with it in the Solutions since they're fairly soft.  The Anasazis are pretty baggy in the heel~ although the heel on Pink is much better if you are ok with laces. I see.. Thanks again for your help! ,Jul 2017,Jul 5 2017,0
5635,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,1,18, Out of curiosity~ have you looked into the scarpa booster s?  The heel is more snug than either ther instincts or the dragos.  And they are super soft and flexible for steep boulders.  I only bought the instincts over them because that same great of the thin rubber.  But looking back~ I'd probably have preferred the boosters.  They downsize extremely comfortably~ too.  I wore a 45.5 in the helix~ 45 vapor v~ 44.5 vs~ and the booster s fit great in a 44 the heel is low volume and a bit narrow~ but the toe box is wide enough to fit my hobbit feet really well ,Aug 2016,Jul 5 2017,0
5636,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,1,19, Yeah~ it's funny...my feet should fit Scarpas perfectly since I have narrow heels and a wide toebox~ but for some reason the Instincts just wouldn't work.  Vapor Vs fit brilliantly~ though...may have to check out the Boosters.,Jul 2014,Jul 5 2017,0
5637,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,1,20, The heel of my vapors was a bit loose~ too. My right foot is about 1/2 to 1/4 sizes smaller than my left~ so that heel in the instincts had a tiny amount of play.  But the boosters didn't move around at all ,Aug 2016,Jul 5 2017,0
5638,Scarpa Instinct VS or drago? ,2,0, My favorite has been the vsr. I've used the instinct vs/lace/vsr the furia and drago. Without a doubt my favorite is the vsr. Just a tad softer than the vs~ and much better edging than the drago. I mostly climb on Sierra granite.,Jun 2015,Aug 27 2017,0
5639,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,0, Just bought a couple of these to clip shoes and such and noticed that they are rated at kN 22\7~ same as the other biners I climb on. The Metolius site has them touted for climbing~ and I'm considering using them to rack my cams. Anyone using them as such~ and with what success or lack thereof?,May 2017,Jun 6 2017,0
5640,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,1, How meaty are your hands? How fat are your fingers? They're plenty strong but whether you decide you like them~ prefer them~ put up with them~ or not use them is totally up to you. I won't go smaller than a Neutrino and my hands aren't big (7.5 glove size).,Oct 2012,Jun 6 2017,1
5641,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,2, Yep~ they are small and possibly a good option for racking cams~ or alpine gear. Like many things convenience vs. light weight. My fat hands don't love them~ but I do have some FS Mini Long draws that I like for alpine routes. Cuts down on weight quite a bit. ,Aug 2011,Jun 6 2017,0
5642,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,3, I rack my cams with them.  When I place a cam~ I'll usually clip a sling into the mini.,Jan 2011,Jun 6 2017,2
5643,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,4, I find I can learn to clip the Nano 22's just fine~ but the main problem is that it's a lot harder to pull off the rope for your follower. The gate opening is so small your thumb gets in the way of the rope while holding open the gate.,Nov 2012,Jun 6 2017,2
5644,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,5, I'm impressed anyone can clip these!  I've switched all my biners to Nano22s which are 1g lighter (totally makes the difference when sending the 5.8+ project) but quite a bit bigger and I'd have trouble with anything smaller... Neutrinos feel ridiculously large and heavy now! The Nanos are $1 more expensive a piece than the Metolius though.,Aug 2006,Jun 6 2017,1
5645,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,6, If you can clip these ok~ then do it!! They're much smaller and lightweight making it way easier to deal with in all forms... except clipping them...  ,Mar 2014,Jun 6 2017,1
5646,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,7, #3 camalot is perfect hands for me~ and I find the mini's to be a huge pain in the ass to clip. I've started using them for hanging gear in the basement~ hammocks~ or as shitty pulleys for weighted hangs. ,Jul 2011,Jun 6 2017,1
5647,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,8, I use them to rack all my cams. I have two very different size hands and I have no issues with clipping.,Jan 2015,Jun 6 2017,1
5648,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,9, I use them to rack my Metolius cams.  I have no trouble clipping them~ but I do have slender fingers.,Oct 2009,Jun 6 2017,1
5649,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,10, I use them to rack my Metolius cams.  I have no trouble clipping them~ but I do have slender fingers. For me~ the benefits of a tiny racking biner outweigh the drawbacks.   Metolius produced a video showing clipping technique in a bunch of positions.   https://youtu.be/UhjPRybOUXg Notice @0:22 the rope running over the top/meat of the thumb instead of in your palm.  That trick helped me with clipping in general~ and especially with clipping the FS IIs. That said~ the Camp Nano 22 biners are definitely an improvement over the FS IIs.  So if there's not too much of a price difference go with them instead.,Mar 2015,Jun 7 2017,2
5650,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,11, So if there's not too much of a price difference go with them instead. $4 a piece on Sierra Trading Post right  now.,Aug 2006,Jun 7 2017,1
5651,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,12, I tried the original FS minis years ago and found them just to difficult to clip easily.  Yes~ I could clip them but it was noticeably more challenging than any other biners I used~ including camp nano.,Nov 2006,Jun 7 2017,0
5652,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,13, If you want lightweight but not lilliputian~ go with the Camp Nanos.,May 2009,Jun 7 2017,0
5653,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,14, I'll add to my previous comment by saying that it depends on the climb.  If you're doing a moderate climb with a long approach~ then they're VERY nice to have.  At least in my opinion.  For any other day at the sport crag or whatever~ then I wouldn't recommend them. ,Mar 2014,Jun 7 2017,0
5654,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,15, Camp Nano 22 is what you want.,Jun 2013,Jun 7 2017,1
5655,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,16, Tried them at the gear store. I find them too small to be comfortable to work with. Much prefer my Camp Nano 22's that are larger and lighter. If you are going down this route~ have a look at the Edelrid Nineteen G instead~ as at least it is one gram lighter than the Nano 22. ,unknown,Jun 7 2017,1
5656,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,17, Racking with tiny carabiners is a great way to get me to volunteer to bring my rack every time we climb.,May 2008,Jun 7 2017,2
5657,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,18, I rack all my cams on these and while at first I had concerns about handling them it turns out I got used to them just fine in short order. For draws~ I use the small Petzl Ange biners - one third of them on long Metolius dogbones~ the rest as trad draws on 11m slings.,Jan 2006,Jun 7 2017,2
5658,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,19, The rope is a little harder to clip when doing hard trad leads. Those desperate clips get just a little bit more desperate.,Nov 2012,Jun 7 2017,0
5659,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,1,20, Thanks for the feedback! I need to look at the Nano22s. I just got super excited about the weight difference when I found these. Been out of the game for a while and after hauling my old gear bag a few weekends full of old ovals and Ds it seems like a godsend for a geezer. I hate to think about a re-rack from a monetary standpoint but DANG! They're sweet! Trying to get smarter AND stronger! Cheers~ friends!,May 2017,Jun 7 2017,0
5660,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,2,0, Too small to be incredibly useful~ but they're absolutely legit as far as strength goes~ can't hurt to rack on them. Check out the nano 22 for a similar weight and cost in an actually useful nonlocker. ,Mar 2015,Jun 29 2017,1
5661,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,2,1, I use them to rack all my cams. I have two very different size hands and I have no issues with clipping. Can I see a picture of your hands? ,Jan 2016,Jun 29 2017,0
5662,Metolius FS II mini biners-gear or keychains?,2,2, Unclipping with small biners is difficult.  I'm just starting trad~ but am finding the nano size is a bit frustrating unclipping from the harness (shoulder sling) and clip a rope into.  Clipping an extension (sling) is fine once the pro is on the wall.,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2017,0

5665,Crusher Megarail Fingerboard question,1,0, Looking around at the posts on wooden hangboards~ I haven't seen anyone comment on this model. I am curious if anyone has any experience on it and what your take is. I'm an intermediate climber looking to hang at home and the low profile of this board appeals to me. Thanks for any insight into how it feels.  http://crusherholds.co.uk/fingerboards/megarail-climbing-fingerboard-hangboard,Sep 2015,Aug 21 2017,0
5666,Crusher Megarail Fingerboard question,1,1, It's pretty limited in the fact that there is only a 20 mm edge size (besides the jugs and pockets obviously)... even an intermediate climber will likely want to play around with edge sizes after a couple months of hangboarding. A board with more edge sizes IMO can be more useful than a variety of hold types with only 1-2 sizes each... I'd much rather have a board with a few edge sizes than any pockets. ,Jul 2013,Aug 21 2017,1

5669,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,0, First~ I’d like to say that the owner~ Josh~ was super responsive and helpful through the whole ordering process.  He helped me decide which material I wanted~ answered all questions I had about design and materials~ and got everything completed very quickly.  I ordered the bag on the night of Wednesday~ July 6th~ 2016 & received it the morning of Monday~ July 18th~ 2016.  An 11 or 12 day turnaround is pretty dang quick for a quality~ hand-made item.   Josh said he’d be able to use any fabric of my choosing.  At the time I asked (July 2016)~ he had 1000D Cordura in every color~ VX21 fabric in most colors~ and an 840D Ballistic Nylon in black on hand.  I think the straps are done in VX51~ not positive.  VX pack weighs ~15 oz but I chose the 1000D Cordura which weighs ~16.5 oz (not sure on the Ballistic Nylon weight).  Pack has an 18” back (23” with extension) and rides above the harness; it is ~18-20 L with a short~ 5” tall extension.  Pack (Front)  Pack (Back)   Now down to business… The Cordura on this pack is thick and feels very durable. I probably wouldn’t drag it through a chimney~ but that’s mostly because I’m a bit paranoid when it comes to those sorts of things.  It would be more than durable enough for tossing around at the crag if you are using it as a crag bag.  It fits really well empty and fully loaded and is super comfortable.  I was surprised how much I could actually fit in it (normally don’t actually carry all of these things~ was just testing its limits) and by how light it felt~ especially with no hip belt.  Pack (Top)  Pack (Open Top)   There is a pocket right behind the neck that’s good for snacks~ first aid~ TP… things like that.  One word of advice for packing would be to pack this pocket first.  I packed it last and it was kind of a pain to squeeze everything in there.  There is also a pocket inside that you can use to take out the foam insert.  I like the support of inserts so I left it and could easily fit a guidebook in there (if you feel like carrying a guide book up a climb…).  Could also probably fit a bladder in here~ but I doubt that is what it’s meant for.  The helmet tabs are a nice touch.  Only thing I didn’t fit that I may want is some approach shoes~ but those could easily attach outside the pack on the haul loop~ or I could get rid of some unnecessary items to make room inside.  Pack (Neck Pocket)  Pack (Interior Pocket)   There wasn’t much info on these packs that I can find so I figured I’d put this out there in hopes it would help someone that’s interested in TUFA products.  I’m certainly not a professional reviewer as you can probably tell but hopefully people will get something out of it.  The only complaints that I have~ which can probably be fixed by just asking for custom changes~ would be no axe loops~ and the haul loops aren’t long enough to close together when the bag is packed.  You would have to use a sling or something to haul it~ not a huge deal.    Other than that~ not too much to say so far; I plan on updating this review after taking it out on some climbs (just received it today~ so take this review as it is).  I’ll also be traveling to San Francisco soon so I’ll test it as an all around/city pack as well.  Here is a list of items I was able to fit (pictured):   •	12 draws   •	Full set of nuts   •	Half set of offset nuts   •	Set of hexes   •	Shoes   •	Harness   •	Rack organizer   •	Tape gloves   •	A few lockers   •	Pulley for Tyroleans   •	TP and shovel   •	Snack(s)   •	Headlamp   •	A few slings and Autoblock   •	Helmet   •	Nalgene   •	First Aid   •	Patagonia Houdini Windbreaker   •	Nut tool   •	Guidebook   •	Pocket Knife   •	70M Rope   •	Last but not least~ TUFA Houdini chalk bag (I’ll review that also)  Pack (Contents)  Pack (Packed~ Ground)  Pack (On~ Back)  Pack (On~ Side)   I really do love how comfortable this pack is and how well it fit.  Again~ I'll update this once I get some real world experience with it~ just wanted to get the pictures and first thoughts out there!  Hope it helps.,Apr 2014,Jul 18 2016,0
5670,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,1, I too have one of these packs. I love it! Josh was indeed super to deal with. If you're looking for a small climbing pack look no further.,Jun 2010,Jul 18 2016,0
5671,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,2, I've been looking and looking and after a year of pondering~ I purchased 4 or 5 chalk bags~ the salathe~ Mochilla and 3 kids bags for family and friends.  I had some specific color choices I wanted to work with (Go Hawks) and a few special colors for kids.  I'm excited to get some quality~ handmade and matching gear for the family.   Many emails exchanged with ideas~ preferences and annoying correspondence from my part I'm sure~ but Josh is above and beyond easy to work with. Customer service like this is rare~ and i'm sure i'll look for more reasons to buy from him in the future as i'd rather deal with Josh than 99% of customer service out there.   I'll edit the post once gear is received and used on a couple of climbs to give my 5.9 crushing opinion on it all.   If looking to get something custom that fits your aesthetic eye and not be another sheeple buying the same gear as the dude 2 routes over~ look at TUFA.   Climb on~,Jul 2014,Jul 21 2016,0
5672,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,3, Only problem with TUFA's stuff is my chalkbag was so cool someone snagged it when I forgot it at the climbing gym.,May 2011,Jul 21 2016,1
5673,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,4, Hey Chris~   Thank you for taking the time and effort to write this up~ I really appreciate it!  The Mochilla is a continuous work in progress and in-depth feedback helps me tremendously.  I'm stoked to hear that the first thing you did upon receiving the bag was max it out~ I always do that with my gear!     I'll look into the haul loops and see what I can do to pair those when the bag is stuffed~ sans sling.  I designed the mochilla primarily for multipitch rock but a tool attachment is a really good feature that I'll keep in mind moving forward.     I'm psyched to hear you're happy with your happy with your pack and I'm stoked to hear what you think after some serious use!   Thank you for the kind words and great pictures~ Cheers! Thank you for the support~ Royal~ Jason~ and Nathanael!  You're support means everything. -Josh,Sep 2009,Jul 22 2016,0

5683,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,14, Pack turned out nice. I did a three pitch route with it on to try it all out. Leading was great with it~ hardly noticed it at all. It is pretty comfortable to hike in although a really long approach fully loaded might wear you down (had about a 10 min approach on the climb yesterday). I will see how it does on a big approach hopefully soon.    Tonight I just was messing around and here is what I put in it.

5684,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,15, Thanks for posting up~ Parker!   Psyched to see you guys stuffing the bag to the absolute max! haha   It's been a constant work in progress but I've been really happy with how lastest rendition (VX-51 straps) performs a variety of tasks (approach~ climb~ haul).     It really has been a communal effort designing these bags and I really appreciate the feedback.   Have a stellar Sendtember~ y'all!,Sep 2009,Sep 9 2016,0
5685,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,16, Can confirm TUFA stuff is awesome and Josh was great to work with. I got what is now called the Salathe bag (chalk bag sized pack) and it's indispensable. Anything less than a half day climb and I can leave the follow pack in the car.,Mar 2013,Sep 9 2016,0

5688,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,19, I love it . The quick slip made me re-think and that you might find a dual market.   If you added a single 1/2 inch Groumet~ a hole in the bottom as a drain & a rope capture point.   Then it would make it a Canyoneering pack~ that could be thrown or used in & out of water.   (Canyoneering often utilizes a 'Dead Man' anchors to rappel from~ I am not a fan)   I've only descended three canyons so I do not know enough to comment more.   I see you have rejected any extioror daisy chain or clip in point~ Other than the haul loops.   This is just my input but I like the way that the certain haul bag like sacs ~ (the smallest ones even)   from one of the biggest companies~ have a three pocket Daisy high on the pack.    Also~ now this is going back 30 yrs~ but WildThings use to make a full strength built in swami belt.   This was on an oversized Fanny pack.   The square-ish shape had a twin line of daisies~ across the top allowing one to rig it to haul or carry back pack style. Tie on the rope or helmet gloves etc.   This pack was paired with a removable ensolite type foam back pad/seat~ gear loops and a clam-shell zipper opening.     I and others soloed~ and climbed  ice with it so the gear loops also worked as tool holsters.   It was a very vesitile little pack. 1/2 as long as yours.!  So kinda to small~ I like the looks /size of the    Mochilla more.   The WildThings carried in two or three ways (very well) and could be used as a belay seat/ boson's chair. It was great for~ bolting kit~ tool bag. & All sorts of pedestrian uses.   It was a specialized item I bought two over a ten year period. But Jon Bouchard ~ was a friend so my last one~ had some custom treatments. I like to tie in~ so along with the buckle~ also provided    were doubled~ rolled~ and barracked tie in loops. Also the daisys were beefed up. His production version the daisys were not linked instead 4 simple bar tacked 1inch long flat tape attached to the top.   Ugh! It seems 14 posts is the limit?

5689,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,1,20, Hey Josh! I was considering getting a Mochilla. Have you done away with the vertical zip on the main body? If I got one I was going to request no main body zip.   Just got notification that my chalk bags have been shipped. Less than a week from placing the order is really quick for custom stuff.,Oct 2007,Sep 14 2016,0

5691,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,2,1, Michael~   Thank you for the feedback on the Mochilla and idea there with the Wild Country design.  I googled around and couldn't any photos online but I feel like you described it pretty well.  A fanny pack style swami would be an awesome Idea for soloing ice.  I'm going to think on that one for sure.   Why Moutain Project stoppeth thy proliferation with the post limits?,Sep 2009,Sep 14 2016,0
5692,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,2,2, Brian~   Thank you for the continued support!  Glad I could throw those Houdinis together for you.     I decided to scrap the side zip to the main just in case of the worst case scenario~ though I actually liked and trusted the zipper.   I'm doing it right above the shoulder straps now with another inside pocket to the foam suspension sheet.   Always happy to add any easy modifications to the bag.   James T~   I had some VX-42 in the past and I really liked the stuff.  Right now it's just have a bunch of colors in the VX-21 and Charcoal~ Marigold~ and Navy in the VX-51.   I've been thinking about another mini haulbag/bolt bag design to make out of either the 42 or 51.,Sep 2009,Sep 14 2016,0
5693,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,2,3, First~ you may find some product inspiration on this thread mountainproject.com/v/issue…   Second~ damnitt. I just bought a new bag. Now I find Tufa and am wanting this stuff   Third~ I'd really like to see some pics of the products in use like the chalk bags and salathe bag. Hard to get a feel how they compare to others in size~ particularly the salathe one which looks interesting. Also wondering how that jives w/ a chalk bag as it seems theyd be in each other's way.,Mar 2015,Sep 16 2016,0
5694,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,2,4, Swabian~   Here is photo of the Houdini being used to give you an idea on size; keep in mind that this model is slightly taller with the bottom compartment.  In comparison to other bags on the market mine tend to be towards the bigger side of the spectrum.   Houdini Chalk Bag   He is a closer look at the Salathe  VX-21 Fabric   And here they are together~ sorry for the poor picture:  Talc and Salathe   The Salathe rides next to the chalkbag and they both work well together.

5703,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,2,13, I've used that material extensively in my original HMG Ice Pack and in a pack from ZPacks before I got my full Dyneema Ice Pack and Summit Pack. It will cut and abrade fairly easily. Nevertheless~ many folks~ me included~ would use it in a pack like this made to be worn while climbing. I would not use it as a daily crag hauler~ as stuff like cams and nut tools and throwing it down on rocks will destroy it. As long as you recognize its limitations~ it's fine   I want two Cuben Hybrid Houdinis~ a Cuben Mochilla~ and a Chalk Bucket. When you're ready to sell them~ I'll place my order.,Oct 2007,Mar 2 2017,0

From the pics~ it seems a bit long to lead with but perhaps I'm wrong there.    Also~ a small request/suggestion: it'd be greate if you could list metric weights As well. You have 20 liters capacity but then oz. Yeah~ I just google'd the conversion but I think for climbing gear~ it's best to always have both.,Mar 2015,Mar 4 2017,0

5711,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,3,1, Just wanted to add to this thread -- I ordered my Mochilla pack recently.  It arrived last week and I took it out on the rock for the first time yesterday. First of all~ to cover the basics~ Josh was incredibly easy to work with.  He handled a rush order perfectly~ staying on top of the process and making sure that he could get the pack delivered in time for my deadline.  Also -- CUSTOM COLOURS! -- how cool is that?  Maybe I just value that more than the average pack buyer~ but my custom yellow and purple pack matches the yellow and purple nail polish that tags all my gear just about perfectly.  Second~ the PACK.  IT's comfortable!  It fits my back perfectly.  It all but disappeared on the climb~ helped I'm sure by the minimalist design.    Hiking in~ the pack was just about perfect.  It was moderately loaded~ and I had a rope backpack coiled and strapped to my shoulders around it.  Zero issues!  On the hike back out it wasn't quite as good.  I coiled the rope and strapped it to the top of the pack.  For the first half hour of hiking it was fine~ but then the weight started to feel a bit more than the lightweight shoulder straps were good for~ so the last half hour was a bit uncomfortable.  For a short approach I think I'd strap the rope~ but for more than 30 minutes perhaps strapping it separately would be in order.  Or~ you could get your climbing buddy to carry the rope instead.  The price is definitely more than some of the alternatives.  The numbers don't lie - the pack costs more than others.  For me~ I decided that I valued custom colours highly~ and I valued supporting a small company highly.  My comparison was between the Mochilla and the Patagonia Linked 16.  For less than the price of a second hand cam~ I got a better pack~ and Josh got my business.  That's a win-win in my book.  If anyone else is debating on whether the pack is good~ or whether the pack is worth it~ you can PM me and I'll be glad to share my honest opinion.  Cheers~  Dave ,Jan 2015,Apr 3 2017,1
5712,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,3,2, Thank you for the kind words~ Dave!  I'm psyched you're psyched with the Mochilla! :D ,Sep 2009,Apr 7 2017,0
5713,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,3,3, Always in flux~ the Mochilla is a continuous work in progress.  New updates include:     TUFA Climbing,Sep 2009,Jun 28 2017,0
5714,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,3,4, The waist belt will be really awesome on the pack. I wish mind had one. ,Mar 2012,Jun 28 2017,0
5715,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,3,5, Parker~ I'd be happy to help you modify your pack with a waist belt.  Your pack was one of the last built without the belt attachment.  I personally never use one~ I added the feature by user request. There are two ways we can do it. 1) You can send your pack in and I'll stitch on attachment points to the strap angle (little piece attaching shoulder strap to body). 2) If you have a sewing machine I can send you the pieces and you can add the belt yourself~ it's super simple and I can walk you through it. Let me know what you think and I'll make it happen~ brother! (On me) Cheers~ Josh   ,Sep 2009,Jun 29 2017,1
5716,TUFA Climbing - Mochilla Pack,3,6, The MP threads are a convenient place to update people.  The design is in a constant state of incremental improvement.   I'll be posting updates on this thread moving forward: Updated TUFA Mochilla thread That said~ I'm still glad to answer any questions anyone may have.  Thank you for supporting a climber-owned~ small business!

5717,Mountain Tools Slipstream Pack,1,0, This is a great little multi-pitch trad/alpine pack that easily doubles as a summit pack for longer trips. Check out my review here! https://northeastalpinestart.com/2017/08/09/gear-review-mountain-tools-slipstream-pack/ ,Nov 2012,Aug 9 2017,0
5718,Mountain Tools Slipstream Pack,1,1, A picture of the inside of the pack would be nice.  I got the jet primo pack and am disappointed with it. They advertise it as hydration compatible and it is not in any meaningful sense. While the jet pack primo is burly it is also heavy; perhaps the new pack is a modern lightweight version.,Feb 2006,Aug 9 2017,0
5719,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,0, Hey all~   I am interested in picking up the Patagonia Northwall softshell~ but as I can't try one on in store and don't want to spend tons of money returning one or two~ I was hoping to ask whether anyone who currently has one would be willing to help me figure out the sizing. I am a chest size 36 and have a pretty athletic build. If anything~ I am a bit thin. That being said~ I have tried a number of other brands (Marmot~ Columbia~ Sierra Designs~ OR) and their smalls have been too small if I wear a fleece midlayer beneath the jacket. The mediums usually have arms that are too long. Any suggestions as to which size would be good for me? Or~ for that matter~ which brands would likely be a better fit? A number of folks have mentioned Arc'teryx~ but in all honesty~ I can't afford them~ even when they are on sale...,Feb 2013,Mar 22 2013,0
5720,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,1, Mountain Hardwear will also fit you very well. I also am in the thin/athletic club and it's like their pieces are tailored for me.,Oct 2011,Mar 23 2013,0
5721,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,2, The body of the Northwall fits very snug/athletic compared to other brands and even other Patagonia pieces. The arms are the longest I've ever experienced. If other brands' smalls were too small in the body for you~ the Northwall will probably also be too small. The arms of the medium will then probably feel ridiculous to you.   Somewhat similar jackets to the Northwall that may fit you differently include: Eider Power Pro Mammut Avers Rab Baltoro Guide Pro Outdoor Research Lodestar   Most are more expensive than the Arc'teryx Hyllus (formerly called the Hercules) that is the Arc' piece that is probably the most like that design.,Oct 2007,Mar 23 2013,0
5722,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,3, Isn't the Northwall like $450?   Backcountry returns only cost $6 if you print their UPS label.  I'd recommend ordering both and seeing which fits best.,Jul 2011,Mar 23 2013,0
5723,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,4, I've a Northwall in a large(I'm a chest size 44) and it fits well~ if n a bit snug in the chest area. Sleeves are certainly a bit too long~ but other than that~ I really like the garment.I have had it out climbing as well as snowshoeing in -15*F weather and it did just fine for me. Warm~ but breathes very well.   As far as pricing goes~ Backcountry has it on sale at the moment~and I think that Patagonia's website may also have the 2011 colors on sale still??,Oct 2011,Mar 24 2013,0
5724,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,5, I am a 36/38 chest and can confirm you want a small.   I have a knifelbade which is pretty much the exact same jacket minus the insaltion.     talk to a rep on patagonia.com..they are sually very helpful with sizing.  though the small should fit you fine.    the longer sleeves are nice and are there so your sleeve will never sncrunh up when swinging a tool.,Aug 2011,Mar 24 2013,0
5725,Sizing on Patagonia Northwall ,1,6, as mentioned above mountain hardwear should fit you very well and dry.q elite is great.   youd prob want a medium in MH,Aug 2011,Mar 24 2013,0

5727,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,0, I know there are plenty~ just wanted to hear what people like. Here is a list of desired features~  ,unknown,Jun 6 2017,0
5728,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,1, I just bought a Granite Gear Rift pack to tote around my tools~ equipment and tablet for work. I'm happy with it~ much better than the over the shoulder tool bag thing I had before.  They have 3 sizes of the Rift (I have the middle size~ I think it could fit a light rack and thin 60m rope). It has some level of water resistance. I'm a little concerned with the long term durability of the material but will know with time. I should add that that I really only looked at GG packs since they're locally based and felt compelled to buy one. I'm sure there is competition from every other manufacturer.  ,Apr 2010,Jun 7 2017,0
5729,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,2, This might be a massive overkill for what you are looking for~ but ou don't specify if you want it to be as small as possible... Deuter Traveler has a main pack + detachable daypack. The little pack (10L) can fit a small laptop and all the chargers~ etc. The main pack fits rope/gear with room to spare for food~ water bottles~ down jacket~ etc.,Mar 2011,Jun 7 2017,0
5730,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,3, If you have an Eddie Bauer outlet near you their Guide 30L pack is great. After 7 years of college~ hiking~ climbing~ and just getting tossed around I finally bought a fresh one. They're usually like $50 or so.,May 2016,Jun 7 2017,0
5731,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,4, Deuter Traveler has a main pack + detachable daypack.  Mama-bear and a baby bear :) a bit too large~ though~ I don't think it fits into the carry-on,unknown,Jun 7 2017,0
5732,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,5, The 26L GR1 from Goruck is actually bombproof: https://www.goruck.com/gr1/ They are not cheap~ but fit all of your requirements. I've had mine for 4+ years as my EDC~ taken it on many climbing and one / two night trips. It does great in all of those situations.,Aug 2016,Jun 7 2017,0
5733,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,6, They are not cheap No kidding. What exactly does it do to deserve that price?  PS. Not to sound dismissive but it mostly looks like military fetish to me.,unknown,Jun 7 2017,0
5734,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,7, Mama-bear and a baby bear :) a bit too large~ though~ I don't think it fits into the carry-on Both my husband and I have flied with them as a carry-on more than once. Mine is a smaller version~ his is a giant one~ so I had my doubts that it would be allowed...  but so far they have been. If you have it stuffed to the gills~ it will look big and will be flagged. But if it is just gear~ it compresses down to look relatively small. ,Mar 2011,Jun 8 2017,0
5735,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,8, No kidding. What exactly does it do to deserve that price?  PS. Not to sound dismissive but it mostly looks like military fetish to me.  Fair question - made in America and top-end materials account for most of it. Their blog documented the R&D and product costs a while back...assuming they are candid about their costs - their markup is consistent with other direct-to-consumer products...To each their own~ but I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of it and should be able to use it everyday for a long time without having to worry about a thing.  The all-black bag is pretty subtle - subtle enough to take it to all but the snootiest of meetings in Corporate America.,Aug 2016,Jun 13 2017,0
5736,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,9, How about the Cilogear Urban 30l? http://www.cilogear.com/citybags.html,Jul 2007,Jun 14 2017,0

5738,Gear bag with a laptop sleve?,1,11," Not thought of as a ""climbing"" or even ""outdoor"" brand~ but I got this chrome backpack for bike commuting and it turned out to be the best for what you're describing.

5740,CAMP harnesses,1,0, Does anyone have experience with CAMP harnesses? I'm about due for a new harness~ specifically one that is comfortable while carrying lots of trad gear.,Sep 2013,Mar 28 2016,0
5741,CAMP harnesses,1,1, I have one~ I think its called the quartz. Very comfortable~ used for a summer of trad climbing in Yosemite.,Jun 2015,Mar 28 2016,0
5742,CAMP harnesses,1,2, I have the Cassin Laser CR Harness and really like it! More comfortable than my Metolius Safe Tech Trad. Slightly smaller sizing though~ so I can't get the tie-in loop/gear loops centered as well as I'd like. I'll probably get a Misty Mountain Cadillac next~ but I'm enjoying my CAMP harness for the time being.   The leg loops are a little bit annoying because they become unclipped from the leg loops very easily.,Jul 2012,Mar 28 2016,0
5743,CAMP harnesses,1,3, I too use the Cassin Laser~ and my former harness was the Laser CR. Whether bolting routes~ long hanging belays~ or just hang dogging pitches; both of these have been the most comfortable harnesses I've used in my 20 year climbing career.,May 2006,Mar 28 2016,0
5744,CAMP harnesses,1,4," I have the Warden....     it's advertised at their big wall harness ""that you can free climb in""...    I've done walls in the Metolius Waldo and the Camp Warden and I like them both for that purpose...   the Warden definitely excelled for free climbing as it is much lighter and much less bulky    I've used it on long free climbs in Yosemite as well (800) feet and longer~ and for shorter multi pitch trad routes in Eldo as well....   I'm very happy with it and would for sure recommend it!    -6 gear loops~ fat comfy waist belt and leg loops~ 2 buckles to keep everything centered",Jan 2013,Mar 28 2016,0
5745,CAMP harnesses,1,5, I had a Quartz CR with fixed leg loops that I absolutely loved~ but ultimately the tie in points started wearing out and it didn't have ice clipper slots for winter use. But for summer trad~ sport and cragging it has been my favorite. I don't think they make a Quartz without adjustable leg loops anymore~ which was something I grew to love about my harness.,Aug 2011,Mar 28 2016,0
5746,CAMP harnesses,1,6," Hey man---I wrote up a quick review of CAMP harnesses this summer: elevationoutdoors.com/c-m-p…   The Warden is pretty great...crazy comfy and tons of organization.    I usually choose the Laser CR---right blend of comfortable~ compact~ and I love the ""no-twist"" belay loop....   Check out the above review...some pics of stuff~ etc....   Good luck~ man!

5747,CAMP harnesses,1,7, Thanks for the feedback everyone!,Sep 2013,Mar 28 2016,0
5748,CAMP harnesses,1,8, I've got a Air CR as my alpine/ice harness and a JSP3 as my rock/all-around harness. I like them both. No major complaints about either. I'd certainly look at buying another camp harness when it's time.,Apr 2006,Mar 28 2016,0
5749,CAMP harnesses,1,9, The Warden is phenomenal for gear-laden climbing. Lots of gear loops~ and super comfortable even with a dozen pounds or so hanging off it. I primarily use mine for bolting~ and really appreciate that it also has ice-clipper slots for hanging hammers~ etc.,Mar 2014,Mar 30 2016,0
5750,CAMP harnesses,1,10, I just got the camp Energy harness a couple months back. It's incredible. You basically get a $150 Arc'teryx harness for $50. Super comfy~ big gear loops~ lightweight.,Sep 2014,Mar 30 2016,0
5751,CAMP harnesses,1,11, I have the camp quarts but the buckles have some surface rust and sharp edges that have damage the webbing cant say i would recommend it. I went for the black diamond chaos~ not as comfy though at least the buckles wont rust.,Oct 2015,Mar 30 2016,0
5752,CAMP harnesses,1,12," That ""quarts"" (which I think is a Quartz CR3) has been discontinued for 3-4 years...I've got a bin-full of CAMP harnesses~ including ones I use exclusively for alpine and ice and I've never noticed rust...   Huh~ weird.",Sep 2009,Mar 30 2016,0

Doug rebuilt the shoe and repaired the other three pairs in various forms of beat with a quick turn around and a perfect fit on all pairs. WOW.  really great skills. .. and I've had shoes done at all the major resolers and some of the not as major from CA to CO and this is the best work.. actually I loved Locker's repairs and I hear he's got his hands in the glue occasionaly. Still have a good repair of Locker's on an old pair of katanas that are my favorite desert shoe because of it.  Thanks to Positive Resoles for the great work!,Feb 2008,Jul 30 2017,3

5769,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,0, --,Jan 2017,Jul 18 2017,2
5770,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,1," Oh there is a lot to be said on this topic.  I would go to the Cold Thistle blog run by Dane and read into alpine pack sizing first to get a feel of what to look for when trying them on. Recommendations: it sounds like despite having a long torso you are using packs too big.  I don't have a long torso and I can get away with using the Wild Things Guide pack and the Arc'Teryx FL series packs. You can get the Guide pack for under $200~ I got mine for free because they made a mistake on my order.  The Arc'Teryx FLs you can snag when they do a seasonal clearance.  Patagonia packs are ok~ but I wouldn't use them when I have alternatives like I mentioned. I can't stand the Black Diamond packs~ I sized to a size Small in them but they are too snug for me~ so for packs I look for an 18"" back despite being an alleged 17.5"".  Also avoid alpine packs that look like they carry heavy loads comfortably (Mountain Hardwear~ Gregory)~ they defeat the purpose of an alpine pack~ and you'll hate them when climbing in them.",Jun 2015,Jul 18 2017,1
5771,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,2, You are going to be hard pressed in finding an alpine pack that is under $200 and is bomber to survive multiple chimneys in abrasive conditions.  You also can try Cold Cold World and see if you can get a custom Ozone.  The guy that runs CCW is pretty reasonable price-wise for what he offers.,Jun 2015,Jul 18 2017,2
5772,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,3, Cilogear 3030 is my pack of choice. I have the W/NW Dyneema version~ but the regular is nearly as beefy. You can substitute a women's fit for any of his packs~ I believe. Give them a call. ,unknown,Jul 18 2017,3

5774,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,5, The Arcteryx Alpha FL 30L is the best alpine pack I have ever owned. I use it primarily for long ice/alpine routes. Its big enough for me to get everything i need in it for an overnight climb~ but small enough so that I only take the essential items. It is made out of bomber material. I threw it down a mountain it is still going strong. I cant say enough good things about it. ,Aug 2014,Jul 18 2017,2

5778,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,9, I have FL30 and I wish it was hydration compatible and side compression straps             Any backpack like FL30~ but is hydration compatible~ has side compression~ and isn't Cilogear. I want to try it on me before buying~ so sadly~ Cilogear is out.  The closest I could find was Ortovox Trad 35~ except it doesn't expand (I like my backpack to be really small when I'm climbing and really big during approach) or isn't as burly (I'm assuming N400-AC mean 400 denier?),Jul 2017,Jul 23 2017,0

5784,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,15, I know you don't want to spend more than $200~ but you can get a custom pack built from scratch for around $300. Alpine Luddites out of Ouray~ Colorado.  Hand made in 'merica~ but so is CiloGear and Cold Cold World.  It appears Alpine Luddites allows you to customize your pack 10x more than either CiloGear or Cold Cold World does. Hope this helps!,Mar 2011,Jul 23 2017,2
5785,Best Climbing/Alpine Backpack?,1,16, Hi Kat~ I'm the owner of Alpine Luddites. I custom fit packs to female climbers regularly. On my packs we can custom fit the harness length(back length)~ belt size~ Shoulder Strap Width~ length and spacing.  For climbing with a harness on I sometimes either fit the pack longer~ so it doesn't catch on the top edge of your harness~ as harnesses become thinner this less of an issue~ or cut them shorter so the ride above your harness. shorter packs don't hike as well. This is all included in the price of any of my packs.  I can also build a pack for you out of Ballistics nylon~ which is ideal for the seirras. While Dyneema fabrics are tough and strong for their weight~ Ballistics and Cordura fabrics are much more durable~ esspecially for lots of alpine rock use. They also save you some money as they cost less.  Feel free to contact me directly if you want more specifics. JC,Feb 2017,Jul 24 2017,3
5786,Omega Pacific Link Cams,1,0," Bad news. Been using the link since it came onto the market as a supplemental cam to our racks~ particulary for small alpine racks or large desert racks.

The ""oh shit piece"" nickname really doesn't mean much to me.  I typically save my link cam for building anchors.   I'm with you on the theory that they know they are withholding knowledge from the public about their cams.   Not to divert the thread but~ REI is complete bullshit.  You should really post your review around some more.   Can you explain what happened with the cam?",Sep 2009,Apr 24 2012,0
5789,Omega Pacific Link Cams,1,3," OP Link cams have been known to be a specialty piece requiring much more diligence than a regular cam to place.  It's also been know for quite some time that if this diligence is not given and EVEN IF IT IS~ they still have more failure mechanisms than a ""normal"" cam.   Without SPECIFIC details as to why YOUR issue is significantly different than other known failures of the Link Cams your just venting and adding nothing to the collective knowledge.   OP has acknowledged that the Links require more care to place and have more weaknesses prone to failure.     Unless this is something NEW (faulty manufacturing etc etc) OP might use be taking their time looking at it or~ just saying ""Hey~ we've been down this road NUMEROUS times~ at some point we just stand by what we've said in the past.""   So~ please provide a more detailed story about what happened. It's also a good time to post up some old RGold wisdom - ""Cams are complicated devices whose security cannot be evaluated in the same way as a nut---consider~ for example~ the Metolius tests that suggested that one in twenty ""well-placed"" cams fail. Essentially~ cams are faith-based protection~ the faith in question being with the engineering principles that are supposed to be in effect. The fact that those same principles can engender arbitrarily large forces seems to be conveniently ignored---for example~ no one paid the slightest attention to my post in this thread on that subject until k.l.k. resurrected it.   As for gear-makers responsibility to ensure that the (nearly blind) faith we would like to place in their gear is justified~ it is important to remember that climbing gear cannot be engineered to withstand industrial safety margins and still be carried up the hill. The nature of the endeavor forces engineering decisions that could prove catastrophic in the field~ and climbers need to understand that. I am not trying to excuse shoddy quality control~ but simply say that fond as we may be of the concept of bombproof gear; it isn't~ never was~ and never will be.    Climbers' faith in cams has certainly been justified over the years by many successful performances~ but on the other hand cams do fail on occasion in spite of being judged good. The fact that they don't break more often may simply be a reflection that the rock will usually give way first. It seems plausible that the link cam stayed in and broke while most other cams would have pulled out. If this is true~ then what you have in all cases is a cam failure. Psychologically~ people are far more likely to accept an extraction as part of the game than breakage~ even if the breakage occurs~ paradoxically~ because of extra holding power.   I don't know whether any of these assertions are true in the case at hand~ but they are certainly true in general: the ability of cams to hold and not break is dependent on a host of conditions~ only some of which are realistically under a climber's control. Any time a cam is placed suboptimally~ the chances of failure go up~ and honestly~ we really have no idea how much.    I think what is beginning to emerge from all this is a sense that cams are not at all the ""no-brainer"" protection they may have seemed to be at first~ and perhaps a broad change of attitude is called for. People used to say that nuts required all kinds of thought and ingenuity and with cams you just fired in a unit. But cams are mechanically far more complicated and less predictable than nuts~ and perhaps it is time to emphasize the respect and consideration their complexity demands.   In both this case and the terribly sad Gunks tragedy~ the cam that broke could have been backed up~ in the case of the Gunks tragedy with good nuts. When faith-based protection leads us to skip readily available options for redundancy~ I think it is time to rethink the entire approach.   """,Jun 2006,Apr 24 2012,8
5790,Omega Pacific Link Cams,1,4, I had both a red and a gold Link cam break on me.  One of the red's lobes cracked right off one day while aiding (no bouncing~ just bodyweight placements)~ and the trigger pins holding the wires in fell out on the gold (this was the first generation~ the trigger has since been redesigned and much improved).  In both cases Mike Lane from Omega Pacific was helpful~ but I'm through with their cams~ which is too bad.

5798,Omega Pacific Link Cams,1,12, I think maybe what they're getting at~ if I may~ is that in at least some of the cases of breakage~ it was attributed to a torquing or twisting of the lobes so that the slivers connecting the lobes could not handle the stress.   I~ like others~ have these cam(s) and am interested to know the details of the break.  Was it a particularly hefty fall?  Was the cam straight in a textbook placement when it broke~ or was it in a placement that would have generated some twisting?   I agree that the lack of response when you sent your cam in is disconcerting.  I also lean toward mattm's response of recurring failures that have been covered before as a possible motivator for their lack of action.  However~ they should have said something.  Anything.   I have the smallest one~ the purple.  Frankly~ after every one of these threads or stories or pictures of broken lobes at pivot points~ I won't rack it again.  It's now just a conversation piece.

5805,Omega Pacific Link Cams,1,19," Without discussing WHAT failed with your particular piece~ we're all just shouting into the wind.  There are MANY MANY reasons a cam can fail.  Was it blown placement with the cam intact?  Was it a ""destructive"" failure where something on it BROKE?  If it did break~ where?  Was it at the ""link"" joint which is the most likely area on a Link Cam?  Else where?  Can you see what I'm getting at?  If you said it ""failed"" because the cable ripped out of the head (ala CCH) THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE WORRISOME than if a link broke.   Even with a highly detailed report to OP~ if the failure wasn't something OBVIOUS~ like the sling tearing apart or the cable separating they may have VERY LITTLE ABILITY to determine failure other than to rule out a materials issue.  OP might still be looking at it to determine what's up or they may have done so and concluded nothing was wrong and it use broke.  What kind of timeline are we talking about with this ""failure to report back""?   There are SO MANY factors that can cause a cam to ""break"" that beyond eliminating manufacturing and material defects~ all that can probably be said is the forces in that fall were such that they exceeded the capabilities of the cam.  There are pictures of mangled TCUs~ Camalots etc etc out there.  None were ""defective"" but all failed.",Jun 2006,Apr 25 2012,0

Again~ the issue is not so much gear failure~ but the lack of interest and response from the manufacturer into the incident and piece in question as well as the editing of gear reviews by a significant retailer.

Because I am 48 and have been around a bit.  I do have a REI member number~ 036096842-W.  That should be a bit old no?   I have had direct conversations with an active President of REI before though regarding improving their company.  Cannot remember the last time I bought any gear from them at all really...so fair enough they should not consider me a customer I suppose~ but I am a member.  I am not an avatar and used my real name on the review.  My name is easily and quickly googled.  They should not be deleting reviews like this in my opinion.   It was quite accurate~ has legitimacy and was made by a member with a legitimate name and member number.    This is my last resort.  I agree it is unfortunate.  The only thing more unfortunate~ would be for me to retire my links over this experience....and not share it with others if I in fact I do have a concern the company is possibly avoiding an issue.  When you are trad climbing~ one critical failure can cause harm to the whole system.

I mean if you want an in depth analysis of why it broke it might take longer then a few days. And probably need more information then you gave them.      Do you expect them to just right away say 'oh yeah that is a defect with the cams!' If it is something new that you brought to their attention they will want to do some Quality control tests on a sampling of other cams to see if it is a real problem or if it was just a bad placement or something.

5821,Omega Pacific Link Cams,2,14, Hello~ All ...    I'm the sales & marketing director for Omega Pacific and found this thread on Wednesday. We're pretty prompt to respond to any returns--particularly when there could be broken gear involved--so I was alarmed to read it.    I looked into it right away and found that we'd received Dow's cam a week earlier--on the 17th--and called him twice~ leaving him a message that he~ apparently didn't receive. I contacted Dow via email on Wednesday~ though~ and we exchanged a couple of messages about what had happened and his cam was repaired and returned that day.    The nature of the damage to the cam was a pair of broken trigger cables~ which is unfortunate and certainly inconvenient~ but not all together uncommon. Sometimes~ when cables get bent near the swage~ they become brittle and fibers can break. We replaced all four cables with freshies~ gave the cam a tune-up and sent it back to him within about eight days of receiving it.    Everything seems to have gone according to our return policies on this one~ save that Dow didn't get the phone message we sent him on the 18th~ and we regret that. We're glad~ though~ that the damage to the cam was not structural~ an easy fix and was returned within 10 days~ as per our typical turnaround goal.

5829,Omega Pacific Link Cams,3,2, lol~ a sampling from Georgia~ Texas and a kid with a tic list of 5.6's....so typical of a MP gear thread and why I never participate....   I appreciate Lane getting to me~ as a result of this thread.  I received the cam yesterday but am still laying down the links...due  to what I examined reading other reviews as well as my experience.   I never said it was a structural break....for the record~ Lane is as perplexed as I about what caused both triggers to fry at the same time. I was looking for answers more than a fixed cam. I was leading two folks.  One needed lowered on a crux pitch~ both were brought up into one device simultaneously.  The lowered rope ran across the the gear on the none lowering rope.  It was fully weighted of course~ at an overhang.   A climbing rope busting trigger wires via friction is something I had never seen nor expected~ yet had to lower many folks over the years for one reason or another. Although I cannot claim that BD~ Metolius or Trango might not react the same way...both Lane and I don't believe friction from nylon~ even against rock~ should bust trigger wires.  That being said~ trigger wires do get frail from packing and re-packing your rack~ bending and re-bending.  This could be a coincidence~ both popping.  My issue is that I originally started using the links since their inception for use on big routes in the Bugaboos...where we are almost always up against time~ particulary measured against daylight and weather (talking about routes like Cooper-Kor).  I prefer to go as light as possible~ sans bivy gear or stove.  I am not going to carry trigger wire kits nor can I afford to stop and mess with broken trigger wires. I was hoping for a more definitive explanation~ i.e. that the wires were coincidentally both at their breaking point when the weighted rope rubbed up against them.  Sounds like that could not be determined.      Anyone want our links~ you are welcome to contact me through MP.  I removed all negative reviews as they all related to OP's responsiveness and Lane obviously fixed that.  I stand by my comments about REI.  I just find that weird~ but am not much of a fan~ so not bothered by it much. (suppose to be member owned...yeah~ sure~ naivety reigns supreme)   As for the chest thumping and name calling....I just once~ just once wish one of you tough guy MP keyboard addicts carried the same attitude when I met you in the field....I am the same ass hole on line that I am in person~ no different.  It would be so entertaining if one of these cats could follow through with his fake bravado when meeting me in person...Rob~ Killis....please introduce me to one some day.

Dow's put in more time/effort than many of us will do in our climbing careers.    Dow's got quite a bit of experience under his belt~ had a problem w/ his gear~ and wanted a answer. Seems pretty simple to me. The omega link cams have had particular problems with their trigger/wire systems~ significantly on the 1st generation cams~ but since have been much improved.

5837,Omega Pacific Link Cams,3,10, You guys should show a little more respect for Mr. Williams. After all~ he's a full-time climber~ as he points out every second or third sentence. And we all know how rare that is in this sport.   Also~ he makes big contributions to climbing. Mostly by going through guidebooks and climbing trade routes and spraying about them on Summit Post~ while at the same time complaining constantly that there aren't any real climbers on that site (which I've heard he actually bought)--but never posting route beta on MP because~ well~ I guess a bunch of real climbers have beat him to it.   And he's also been in the climbing mags. For falling something like 200 feet on a 5.8 when he was off-route and run-out.    Not to mention the fact that he climbs in Utah AND Canada! Who among us can say the same?   So~ let's show him the respect he deserves.,Jan 2008,Apr 29 2012,1
5838,Omega Pacific Link Cams,3,11, I have to side with Austin here for the first time ever~ that was a total dickhead comment about the 5.6 tic list~ especially since I still have about 100 more classic 5.6s I want to do on top of the 100 I have ticked at the Gunks. The original post didnt make a ton of sense either~ especially with no pics.   The funny thing here is a large percentage of Gunks n00bs carry these link cams and love to spray about how great they are all day at the crag. I'd rather whip on some old Smiley cams I bought from China 17 years ago.,Mar 2006,Apr 29 2012,0

I realize you've built yourself a hardman~ know it all persona over there but you've failed to understand that no one else gives a rat's scrawny ass how big of a bad ass you've convinced yourself you are.   You're screaming that the sky is falling and it turns out you broke a trigger wire and OP fixed it for free. To say thank you~ you've decided to pretend like they failed to follow up with you and went ahead and got a 3 page thread of drama going by with holding the information that the only thing that broke on your cam was a TRIGGER WIRE!   Not a fan of Link Cams or REI but I think the response you got from both was perfectly reasonable. Instead of trying to trash a companies name because your feelings got hurt~ how's about you just check your damn voice mail?     At this point I'd think a man of your stature and importance in the climbing world should realize that it's time to publicly apologize to both OP and REI for acting like an 8 year old hysterical school girl.",Feb 2012,Apr 29 2012,1

5847,Omega Pacific Link Cams,4,0, I wanted to share my story of Link Cam failure.  I was belaying my partner at the start of a sport route which began on a ledge up 25-30 feet.  Due to the dangerous position and the height of the first bolt~ my partner placed one of the larger link cams in a crack with questionable rock.  He climbed a move or two~ then a hand or foot hold broke~ causing him to fall.  The Link Cam failed to arrest his fall~ and he ended up falling past the ledge I was belaying from.  Upon inspection of the cam~ the lobes had become inverted. The rock blew out where it had been placed.  I'm assuming the cam failure was due to dynamic forces generated by the failure of the rock~ and that if the rock had not failed the cams would not have inverted.  Even so~ I feel that the cam lobes should not have become inverted and I will never buy a Link Cam~ and place partner's LC's with hesitation~ if at all!,Aug 2012,Jan 14 2013,0

5855,Omega Pacific Link Cams,4,8," I've got 1 link cam that I use. I've fallen on it once and didn't have an issue~ although it wasn't a hard fall. It was in granite and ""perfectly"" placed according to their website. I for one like REI~ but sometimes their workers need a little more school...Case in point... I had one tell me that I should replace my rack of metolius cams with all link cams because they have a wider range!! WTF?  Anyway here is from their website regarding placement.....   Here are a few more pointers:    ¡ Assess the overall placement for quality of the rock. Dense~ solid stone makes for better placements~ generally. Flaky~ loose rock or expanding flakes should be avoided~ whenever possible.   ¡ Attempt to place cams so that there is maximum contact between the lobes and the feature~ ensuring that the load is as equally distributed as possible between all four lobesets.   ¡ Place cams so that they are neither ""tipped out"" nor ""overcammed"" as either instance can make the placement less stable or difficult to remove. As a general rule~ deploy Link Cams so they are within 70% of their maximum range and 10% of their minimum~ fully-retracted position.   ¡ Clip a carabiner and a longer sling to the sewn sling on wandering routes or under roofs to prevent the cams from ""walking.""   ¡ Be sure to anticipate direction of load~ should you fall or weight the cam. This is particularly important with Link Cams~ due to their unique construction. Since they are built using trisected cam lobes~ Link Cams can become damaged%u2014and the placement may fail%u2014if a load is placed that makes the cam ""shift"" when a climber falls onto it. We are constantly researching ways to improve the strength and durability of Link Cams~ but it is critical that Link Cams be placed with direction of load in mind. You should always place any removable protection with this principle in mind~ of course~ but Link Cams in particular should be placed so that the stem is aimed directly toward the ground and~ when loaded~ the position of the axle does not rotate during a fall or when bounce-testing. Although Link Cams' flexible stems can help ""correct"" a less-than-ideal placement~ it is still important that the initial placement be made in proper alignment with anticipated load.   ¡Visually inspect every placement before relying on it! This is an excellent discipline regardless of which piece of gear you use~ but with Link Cams~ proper placement is crucial to maximizing safety and effectiveness. Placing a piece ""blind"" can often lead to an improperly-placed cam and may not be reliable. If a Link Cam is not able to be placed properly~ in direction of anticipated load~ select another piece.   ¡ CE/UIAA certified and made in the USA",Feb 2006,Jan 14 2013,0

5860,Omega Pacific Link Cams,4,13, I really enjoyed this thread showing people on MP have independent~ logical thoughts and don't just blindly follow one side~ request more information when the detail are shady~ and recognize information hiding.   Among other things~ this thread shows that: the cams didn't fail in their main purpose~ someone commented trigger wires need replacement no matter what company (good for me to know)~ that the people on MP are able to suss out a situation~ and lastly~ Omega Pacific's customer service post shows they are a great company.   I used Omega Pacific Link cams for the first time yesterday... pretty cool additional features above regular cams.  One of the most inventive features (the others being dual axle cams~ 3 lobes) for cams since SLCDs were invented.

5864,Omega Pacific Link Cams,4,17, I've been climbing for about 20 years.  I have had black diamond cams fail on me~ maybe it was bad placement~ maybe it wasnt. .   Maybe they were defective~ but anything with moving parts is bound to fail at some point no matter how well built.  On Oct 10th of 2016 (my birthday) I took a 100 foot fall.  I blew a well placed nut and was hanging by something (I was too far below and too hurt to see what it was).  Some climbers above retrieved the life saving piece~ it was a yellow link cam.   I've been trad climbing since and never hesitate to use my link cams.  I think it's odd to hear that people have taken falls on the link cams and the cams held up~  but people that are just hanging on cams have failed.  Sorta defy's logic.   Dow Williams~ could you please share what the circumstances were that led to your cam failure? ,Aug 2011,Jul 18 2017,4

In addition to the reduced impact force Petzl helmets are tested for “side impact” as well… something not yet required to pass a more general CE standard. Could you elaborate on this?  As far as I'm aware~ there's little difference between the EN and UIAA climbing helmet standards aside from the maximum force requirements. This material [expanded polystyrene] adds some ruggedness and durability to what at times could feel like a fragile construction material (the expanded polypropylene that some folks assumed was “Styrofoam”). Ironically~ that stuff in cups and packing materials we call Styrofoam is actually... expanded polystyrene.,May 2013,Jul 13 2017,0

5891,Black Diamond Alpenglow Sun Hoody Review,1,7, I've had both of the Patagonia sun hoodie models: the one meant for climbing and the one meant for fly fishing. The one meant for climbing is most similar to the BD model in terms of material weight~ and I have to say that I found it too thick and heavy for serious heat. The one meant for fly fishing~ however~ has about 60% of the material weight and is appropriately lightweight and cool enough to use in hot~ humid sun conditions. I've worn it for about 5 years~ through some of the worst conditions you can imagine (chimneys~ thorny bushes~ etc) and it has held up marvelously.,Apr 2013,May 11 2017,0

Heel hook better than anything I've used (Miura~ Moira vs~ Boostic~ Moccasym~ etc...) Added bonus~ finger/ ring lock cracks! The fit has relaxed enough from stretching that they still perform on the steap stuff but let the spit in the sole allow my feet to wiggle in the tight stuff.  TC Pro- 44 Miura vs- 43 Skwama- 42.5 Two notes:     I'm going to start rolling with one pair 1/2 smaller and one at regular fit. The tighter pair will be reserved for the steap pockets and glassy smears where I live now.     The Skwama's don't edge on anything less than obviously easy. They do however smedge (smear/edge) on minuscule protuberances like nothing I've used before. ,Feb 2006,Jun 26 2017,0

5930,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,1,0," Just got in one of the new WC Friends. It was 99 here in TX today so it might be a bit before a real world review. This is just initial impressions playing with it side by side with my #3 C4.   TLDR: A better and more refined Camalot C4. WC has taken what is for many the gold standard for cams and improved the product without straying too far from the norm. People looking for a better C4 and not stoked on the Ultralights should give these a serious look. So long as on rock performance (likely a tad better) and durability ( perhaps a tad less) hold up~ these are likely to become the new new gold standard for many.    This is for the Blue #3 C4 equivalent.    - Nearly identical in size to a C4. The stem is a bit shorter the the prototype pics that made it slightly longer than a C4. Wish they'd kept it slightly longer. Perhaps the similar length allowed weight savings. See below.  Width is nearly the same.   New Friend vs C4 Camalot  C4 vs Friend vs Dragon.  Note the longer Friend Prototype and SWAGE near thumb loop   - It appears as though WC changed the cable design since the announcement. Older pics show a thick cable swage above the thumb loop but this version has none.  You can see the new style above and the old swage in this old #3 photo.    Old Proto Swage   - cable head termination looks better than prototypes. More material missing than the C4 for less weight I assume. Shorter swage here as well. Don't know if this is true for smaller sizes but looks like #1 and below have longer head termination/  Friend head termination     - trigger wires seem more refined than C4 (swages cleaner and smaller)   New Friend - Hollow Axel and trigger wires - nice and clean   - cam springs slightly more stiff than C4. Nice!  The trigger and cam action seems a bit more refined vs C4. Hard to quantify.  Like a Helium biner vs Hotwire~  just a bit nicer.    - cam lobes. Wider throughout the entire arc. Obviously the newer raw cam surface feature here as well. WC said the springs combined with this surface and right angles (vs older helium curved edge) will help reduce walking of double axle cams  New Friend on the Right   - extendable sling adds a biner length more. Some don't like this but I like that it allows options as to where the carabiner can lie. Sometimes in deeper placements the biner ends up over an edge. Adding a QD doesn't change that fact. The double sling gives you that option. Bar tacks have arrows to indicate which end to grab and pull. A nice touch  Friend Extendable Sling   - weight : Weight of #3 WC = 190g which is well below their published specs online (.  Perhaps those changes to cable length and swage reduced weight.  Will update chart ASAP with new numbers   - range : WC designers say they played with the ranges of the set a bit to try and avoid the known gaps in the C4 range. They're pretty close for most sizes but note decent the shift for the #2 range.    Published range from both Manufacturers. Weights are BD Published and WC my weighing.     Overall~ these are really slick and a nice improvement over the C4 in my first blush opinion. I haven't played with an Ultralight Camalot but I suspect more will gravitate toward this iteration of the cam.  It will take some miles to determine if the changes effect durability in any significant way and if the lower rating (12kN/10kN sling extended) matters much at all.   I'm a big fan of Totem Cams and their basics but do appreciate the double axel design for inward flaring placements where the passive rating helps.  The extendable sling also adds to the versatility.  These mixed with Totem offerings would make for a very good rack IMO.   Will update as time and milage allows.   Edit 1:  A poster over on the UK Forums who was involved in the redesign project made the following comments which I found quite interesting.    ""As for the cams not shattering the earth with their amazingness~ what you need to consider is that Heliums bombed. Like completely. Hence why shops were discounting them very soon after they came out. It seemed to the sales guys that the market was at double axle whether they liked it or not. Lets face it~ single axle cams are more stable~ they are lighter per unit~ in terms of shear physics~ single axle cams are a less complicated and more robust solution. so what should they do? Continue to sell what the market considers a dud or take the hit and move on?    Now whilst thy might appear to be the same as a Camalot they really aren't. We made a big effort to optimise the sizes so that there are absolutely no inconsistencies through the range - no other company has done that - DMM have literally copied the range sizes of BD but added a 13.75 degree angle. If you look at in depth there are some big gaps and some big compressions in their range. Then we also made the lobes as wide as we could (Stevo is going to disagree on this one) to help prevent the most common real world pull out which is through rock pulverisation - if you look at DMM's new offering and Metolius's new sharktook cam surface they have tried to address the same issue in a different way. So weight for weight you have more metal in contact with the rock to help reduce the surface stresses present within the rock. Then we reduced axle weight by making them hollow which means you more or less get 2 for the price of one.    The pull out sling again - it's a compromise - some people like it some don't and just want ultimate strength. What Toby says above about not needing more extenders is to some extent truth~ but consider this: the dragon achieves much of it's lightness through not having a thumbloop. The cable section of the thumbloop as it's steel weighs considerably more than an aluminium pigs nostril. They have further reduced weight by shortening the stem cable as much as possible. What you lose by doing this is reach inside the crack and some 5cm in length~ about the length of a small carabiner. By retaining a thumbloop you actually come back to a similar extended length to a standard loop length plus an extender. So it's a little more complex than just calling marketing. It also makes them in my view the most comfortable in your hand out of any product on the market~ especially the largest silver/grey one.    So overall~ we've made lots of small incremental improvements to deliver what they feel is the best set of features they can.   Now then~ Ultralight BD's. To be honest having held them in my hand at tradeshows~ I'm not convinced. The cam lobes are thin as hell which is NOT a good thing on double axle cams~ they are not as light as they could be~ the whole thing is pretty bulky and the sling is not hermetically sealed which means if you get grit and dirt ingress~ it will sit there abrading the dyneema internally with no way of inspecting the sling as the plastic is black. Water and dirt trapped in a plastic tube with fibres~ even dyneema fibres is not a great idea. But I guess long term usage will prove I'm wrong...""",Jun 2006,Jun 13 2016,1

5939,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,1,9, I can second that TLDR~ Matt. I just picked up a green friend as a supplementary piece~ and it almost feels like a next-gen c4--slight improvements on a very familiar platform. I haven't had the pleasure of placing it yet~ but here's what I have gathered from my admittedly limited experience with it so far:   - more ergonomic trigger (it just feels nicer in my hand)   - trigger pull doesn't feel quite as tight as my green camalot   - Rated for 10kn in both active and passive vs 14kn on .75 c4   - extendable sling is a welcome addition as you stated above   - range is close~ but not quite as good as the c4 (plugged it into my crack wall along with the c4 and it seems to over-cam just before the camalot does~ but also seems to have a bit more on the top-end)   - I can't yet speak on the performance of the bare lobes~ but I assume it will stick better than the anodized lobes of a brand new c4.    -the piece just seems to exude craftsmanship and is very pleasing on the eyes   Overall~ it seems like a solid alternative to the c4~ and I'm confident that time will prove itself to be.,Apr 2015,Jun 25 2016,0
5940,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,1,10, I'm surprised there aren't more reviews/posts here so I'll add my extremely qualitative/useless $0.02   Just bought a couple Friends (1 and 2) to supplement my BD rack and have put 25 pitches on them in the past two days (brag~ sorry. Squamish is incredible).    Bottom line: I LOVE these cams. They feel so good~ and I go for them over my C4's. Now maybe my C4s are a little worn but the action on the Friends is really good and they seem to bite into rock like flesh in a zipper. I had a look at the UL C4's at the store but the plastic seems really...bad/uninspiring. I know this isn't great info but seriously these are great. Buy some?

5944,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,1,14, I emailed Wild Country about this 4 weeks ago~ and they said this was taken into account during the development process~ but the follow up email from their product development team never came through even though I've pinged them a couple times since then. I'll post back here if I ever do get that follow up email.   Until then I'll just have to assume the cable will get tweaked under a 3-4 kN load~ and the sling will get cut by the cable at 10 kN (which is what it's rated for when the sling is extended~ so that part matches up with the BD QC lab article). I don't know if I need a cam to hold up under more than 10 kN~ but the 3-4 kN thing seems like something I could generate that on a normal fall and I don't know if the thumb loop is weakened after being bent like that. It's too bad because the extendable sling is something I'd really like to have built into a cam.,Dec 2014,Nov 22 2016,0

5946,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,1,16, The assumption that the thumb loops are identical is the problem. Yes~ BD thumb loops kink with thin slings~ but that's because they were designed for wide slings. Aliens and (old) mastercams have thin slings and thumb loops~ but they don't kink because they were designed for thin slings. Therefore~ having a thumb loop and a thin sling is not reason to assume that the thumb loop will be permanently kinked after small falls.

Any U  shaped cam with a spreader bar negates the pinching by limiting the compression of the cable by the sling. The compression goes into the spreader bar~ the cable is holding the sling with its tensile strength.    All looped cable units suffer from the sling getting pinched and bending the cable. If you like extendable runners get dragons. If you like thumbloops get camalots. If you like your aliens and mastercams~ get them reslung c4 style.    Worth it for me.",Dec 2011,Dec 27 2016,0
5950,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,1,20, I just got size 1~2 and 3 will be writing a review~ initial impressions are.   1. Noticeably lighter with even just a single cam.   2. More flexible than the C4 i think this comes down to not only a different type of wire but also the swage by the cam is different I don't see this making much of a difference unfortunately due to size 1 and down having a single forged head termination (this could be lighter).   3. Not quite as nice a trigger pull in my opinion far from a deal breaker and i prefer it over dmm's dragons (which is fine) it's just not super nice.   4. The extendable sling is super short and i don't see it having much in the way of practical application I played around with some cord and i see no reason why it couldn't have gone round 3 times instead of just twice.   5. Less of a impression on the cam and more on wild country I cant seem to find any information on re-slinging them~ it a long way off (hopefully) but it's disconcerting knowing i will have to come up with a new way to re sling my cams.(This point is mute to most of you being americans~ you can get just about anyone to re-sling your cams)   6. High standard of manufacturing in general~ all in all they seem like a very very well built cam and i would highly reccomend them especially to anyone in the US where the re-sling issue isn't an issue at all.,Oct 2015,Jan 5 2017,0

5956,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,5, Hey Travis~ I've put around 50 pitches on the green and yellow sizes~ which might be enough to make a decent assessment.    Pro's:     i) The lobes bite nicely into a bunch of different rock types (basalt~ sandstone~ granite) and feel super secure. Second only to the new DMM lobes.   ii) Flexibility: I've found that equivalent Friends feel slightly more flexible than their C4 counterparts   iii) Size overlap: I've found that Friends run slightly larger than the equivalent C4s~ which--I find--is nice for more size coverage (in a double rack of singles c4 and singles Friends)   iv) Extendable slings are nice for situations where the biner is running over an edge   v) Durability: No issues what-so-ever~ so far. The lobes don't seem to get manked up as quickly as my C4's    Con's:   i) Extendable slings: Not long enough to make much of a difference in most situations where extension is necessary. Extending them is a PITA if climbing near your limit.    ii) Trigger pull (in the yellow): minor gripe~ but it doesn't feel as smooth as my C4s.Bottom Line:   These things are great! I find that I reach for them before my equivalent C4s. If these things only had the lobes of the new Dragons and more useable extendible slings they would be damn-near perfect~ in my eyes. Ideal set up would be singles of Friends supplemented w/ C4s/Dragons for coverage.,Apr 2015,Mar 11 2017,1
5957,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,6, Thanks for the feedback Alex!,Oct 2015,Mar 11 2017,0
5958,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,7," I agree with the comment about the extendable slings not being long enough. I put my own extendable slings on my cams~ tied to a better length IMO. Another option for longer extendable slings is custom re-slings by these  guys   Question: you say they lobes don't get ""manked up"" as much as C4s. Can you clarify what you mean by this? Less likely to get dirt/grime? More resistant to scratching or deformation? Also~ regarding the size difference~ is it very noticeable? I.E. Would somebody who is used to C4 sizes get thrown off by the difference if they opted for a rack of friends rather than supplementing an existing rack of C4s?",May 2014,Mar 11 2017,1
5959,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,8, The lobe thing is just my limited personal experience~ but I've noticed more little dimples/small deformations in the lobes of my C4s following a whip~ than my Friends (especially areas w/ small crystals/features in the cracks).    The size thing really only becomes noticeable at the very bottom of the range~ and you get used to it pretty quickly.,Apr 2015,Mar 11 2017,0

5961,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,10, Wildcountry got back to me in response to my question about the thumbloop: Thanks for your mail regarding the Wild Country Friends and sorry for the delayed response.   We have been conducting further in-depth destructive and cyclic testing on our friends in both the extended and doubled sling configurations and found that a kink will start to appear at the thumbloop around 5kN (as stated by our competitors) and gets more pronounced as the load increases but even after cyclic loading our friends retain their strength.  We believe that the advantages of an extendable sling outweigh the visual kink effect giving climbers more choice in the shop and possibilities on the wall.  I hope this answers your question. ,Dec 2014,Jun 6 2017,1
5962,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,11, I don't mind a kink like that if it doesn't reduce the strength. My only concern is if the kink damages the plastic tubing and exposes the cable to the sling over time and cyclical loading. ,May 2014,Jun 6 2017,0
5963,New Wild Country Friends (twin axle) - table top review,2,12, Look at old aliens. You Load anything enough the tubing is going to come off. The first thing i do with cams with skinny slings is put a Camelot style sling on them. ,Dec 2011,Jun 8 2017,0
5964,REVIEW: Mountain Tools Max Rack - Big Wall Climbing Rack,1,0," It's not often that I come across a piece of gear that I love.  I'm a gear guy~ don't get me wrong...but usually gear is just that~ gear.  Well~ I just got the Mountain Tools Max Rack and I love the damn thing.  So much so that I felt compelled to do a review...so~ here's an in-depth review w/ comparison to the only other big wall rack that is comparable~ the Yates Big Wall Rack. Mountain Tools Max Rack Price: $99.95 Yates Big Wall Rack Price: $99.00 The biggest differentiator of the Mtn. Tools. Max Rack is that it uses the pocketed gear loops commonly seen on Metolius's big wall rack.  In addition~ the rack is ""X""d on the back making it much less prone to slippage off the shoulder. Now some Pics:  Size I got was an XL.  Fits great as i'm a wide-shoulder person. 6 gear loops on each side PLUS one big one dead center of back.  I love this feature as there's often some gear that I ""think"" i might need or for a small water bottle~ this loop is great and keeps stuff out of the way. It also has a chest strap~ but unlike the yates~ no center ring to be used as a chest harness...though you could add one or just clip to the double-backed chest strap.   Center back gear loop above.  Six gear loops on each side.  It looks like 5mm cord runs through the gear loops and is tied onto the rack.  So ostensibly you could replace the cordage if need be.  Rack has two side straps~ about 2 inches wide each.  Unlike the Yates~ the side straps are not padded~ which may cause some chaffage.  This is one area where the yates is a bit superior~ but the Max Rack won't cause you to sweat as much.  1 Inch tubular webbing is what the shoulders are made out of.  With two larger gear loops on each shoulder plus one smaller tie-in point~  for keeper cords.  The back sides are made of 2 inch webbing with 1 inch sewn on top but still accessible so you could hang stuff off the back side of the shoulder loops if you wanted to.  The shoulder foam is thicker than the yates coming in at about 3/4 inch which will surely compress to 1/2 inch.  It's more comfortable than the yates.   Can see here the 5mm (or maybe 4 mm) cord. Good fit and customizable based on the buckle.  Side loop and lower loop.   Put some gear on so you could see how it ""drapes"" :)   Okay~ here is my absolute~ 100%~ hands-down~ FAVORITE PART!  The gear loops~ In the pic above I am actually bending over forwards.  The gear doesnt all bunch up in my lap like the Yates.  This is the best part of this rack.  Inside shot of the X'd backing.  Um...pussy cat for scale? :)  Adjustable front buckle.  Okay~ now here's a head to head with the Yates.  You can see here how both racks utilize two levels of racking~ a top part (2 gear racks for the mtn tools and 2 for the yates [yates is white/black/checkered]) and a lower rack (4 loops for the mtn tools and 1 single huge loop [brown] for the yates). With the yates~ anything on this lower (brown) loops comes crashing together the minute you bend over forward and makes a bloody mess in your lap.  Doesnt happen with the Mtn. Tools.    Mtn Tools rack shoulder pads are thicker.  Note the padding on the side straps of the yates~ this is one advantage of the yates~ but that's about it.  Okay~ so I hope you enjoyed the review.  Feel free to email with questions.  And~ if you're interested~ I am selling the yates harness :)  Cheerio~  Jeffo",Mar 2016,Apr 21 2017,2

5967,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,0, This rope was uncoiled and used for the first time at the base of a short sport pitch in Red Rock (top rope) and when the leader (who did not fall) was lowered to the ground~ they noticed these three or four core shots on the rope.    This is an Edelrid Raptor. Has anyone else had any issues with this rope. It is supposed to be a durable rope~ but what the hell.    According to my friends (who are all experienced climbers and know how to not destroy a rope) they didn't fall~ didn't have it running over a sharp edge~ and didn't have anything funky going on with biners or anything.    Luckily they took it back to REI where they had just purchased it and were able to get a different rope from Mammut.   Thoughts? rope   rope 2   rope 3 ,Dec 2007,Nov 27 2014,0
5968,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,1, None of us have ever seen anything like it. I've put dozens of ropes through the ringer. I have ropes I've used for years from everything from top rope to trad to ice and huge alpine routes. I've never seen anything like this.    Hoping it's a weird sheath thing. Couldn't pull up any info of similar cases with this rope online.,Dec 2007,Nov 27 2014,0
5969,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,2, I don't have anything to say about edelrid ropes... mammut has some amazing ropes and is the only company that I trust when purchasing an expensive rope. I fully trust there durability and have never had to send back  a rope. I have bought three ropes from them that have all lasted two to three seasons. The first one was a tusk~ that I used for TR soloing and lead. It healed up quite well. If I were to splurge on a new rope rope~ I would save up for a new revelation... Only if you are interested in redpointing and not projecting routes with it. I have taken it on MANY climbs and it shows minimal wear. Another rope from them to look out for is the Infinity classic. You can usually find it on sale so it doesn't feel so bad if you wreck it on a climb...Great for projecting...,Oct 2013,Nov 27 2014,0

5973,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,6, I've used an edelrid rope (livewire~ 9.8mm) for many years Probably 150+ climbing days~ many many falls- I eventually retired it close to the 8 year mark. Hopefully that rope was just a lemon. For all the people in love with mammut ropes - there are plenty of good rope companies out there. Mammut is one of many.,Apr 2006,Nov 28 2014,0
5974,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,7, which route?   on another note- Edelrid invented the climbing rope~ and its been my experience both when working for them and after~ that they make good lines. this looks like a random thing- most likely a sharp edge or a nicked carabiner.    my first advice when you experience something weird with climbing gear is to always contact the manufacturer. they can't know about an issue if you dont report it. REI most likely never contacted Edelrid about that rope and so unless Moritz sees this post~ they'll never know about it.,unknown,Nov 28 2014,0
5975,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,8, We as a group really can't say anything about what happened to your rope. We didn't see how the toprope was set up~ whether the rope ran over an edge at some point~ and you yourself may not even remember the details that would solve this mystery. I would definitely return to where you climbed and try to figure it out by setting up this rope in the same way and examine the situation.,Jan 2001,Nov 28 2014,1
5976,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,9, I have the exact same rope as the one in the picture~ with whatever fancy dry treatment Edelrid has. I've been using it at least once a week - usually more - since around May. I usually stick to steeper routes where the rope rarely touches rock~ but I must have taken hundreds of good whips on this rope. You must have some horrible luck~ because mine honestly isn't even frayed. It's actually still kinda stiff and even kinks quite often. It's like it's the perpetually brand new rope. I honestly wish it would wear out~ because I don't really like the feel of the rope and I want a skinnier one. Also~ the bi-pattern is basically invisible. I can't justify buying another rope until I wear this one out~ though. Maybe just count yourself lucky that you were able to give it up and exchange for another rope. As durable as mine seems to be~ I really don't like it that much anyways.,Jan 2010,Nov 28 2014,0
5977,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,10, Seems like a fluke occurrence but unsettling nonetheless. It may be worth noting in this thread that Edelrid started manufacturing all the Petzl ropes this year. I have been climbing on a new 9.5 Petzl (Edelrid) rope with no problem.,May 2010,Nov 28 2014,0
5978,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,11, Hey Clint~    thanks for posting those pictures. This looks like nothing that I have ever seen with any Edelrid rope. Do you remember at which REI you bought this cord? It would be great to actually get a hold of it. John is right~ REI never contacted us. On the pictures I can´t quite tell if the sheath is frayed and if the core itself is damaged or not. Is there any chance the rope got stored close to a leaking battery in a trunk for example?   How far apart from each other were the core shots? So far we have had zero Raptor returns - makes it one with yours. I´m glad you got it exchanged quickly and hassle free.,Mar 2013,Dec 1 2014,2
5979,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,12, Clint: I would recommend returning the rope to the manufacturer for inspection instead of returning it to rei for another cord. It seems like maybe more gear failures are slipping through than we think because people are not reporting issues~ they are just getting their gear replaced and moving on. Part of the process of keeping climbing gear at a high standard is that we demand it be; if we're all just satisfied getting our personal stuff replaced then quality is going to (continue to) go down.   Bummer~ I was just about to try an edelrid rope.,Nov 2006,Dec 1 2014,0
5980,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,13, Where in the rope was this?   If you coiled the rope back up they way it came packaged  did the damaged areas line up.  Then I would wonder about unboxing process ( razor knife hitting it just enough).  Or the unpacking at home or the base of the route.  Did you use a Garda hitch by chance?  And what belay device was used.  I've seen some old devices with some groves woren into them.   I'm glad everyone is safe and no injuries came from this.   Please remember to check your gear ( and partners) before climbing.,Jul 2012,Dec 1 2014,0
5981,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,14, Allow me to clarify.    This incident happened to my special lady friend. I was not present. I merely relayed the message to the community and was asking if they had seen similar things.   I've used Edelrid ropes before and have had good luck. I figure it is a freak thing~ but she was with several other experienced climbers who definitely know their way around gumby rope disasters. They were all vexed.    It's a mystery. No one is trying to run Edelrid through the dirt here~ just seeing waht the community thinks. I've coreshot new Sterling ropes too~ so things happen out there.,Dec 2007,Dec 2 2014,0
5982,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,15, This is one reason why I tend to go for ropes with a slightly thicker sheath percentage. Ropes like this and the Sterling Nano are light~ but they attain that weight by having a very thin sheath and therefore sacrificing durability.    Just a thought and a lesson learned. My Special Lady Friend would normally have spoken to Edelrid but she was on a quick climbing trip and didn't have the time to wait for a new rope to arrive~ so she merely returned it to REI. Literally~ she used it on one 60' pitch~ so it was brand new and she had bought it at the store several days earlier.    Cheers!,Dec 2007,Dec 2 2014,0
5983,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,16, Hey Clint~   thanks for responding to the thread again. Without properly inspecting the entire rigging set-up and the hardware it is not entirely fair to blame the rope itself. It is often hard to backtrack everything that happened in an incident with so many variables (hardware~ edges etc.) especially if it is all second hand knowledge. Anyways~ I´m glad your friend has a new rope she is happy with now.,Mar 2013,Dec 2 2014,0
5984,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,17, I've climbed on edelrid ropes exclusively for the past 7 years and had absolutely no problems.  Probably something about the use was abnormal.,May 2013,Jan 16 2015,0
5985,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,1,18, Looks like someone was hang dogging and swinging back and forth on it while it was over a sharp edge. Maybe trying to get back on route. A little sandstone burn...Highly unlikely that it has anything to do with the rope quality or manufacturer. Should be a learning opportunity for anyone that was hanging off that rope that day.,Jan 2012,Jan 16 2015,0

5988,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,2,0, Two comments:   One:  Thinking it is best if the people involved do the posting and respond to replies~ NOT SECOND HAND INFO!!  So for instance: what was the anchor?  Very worn rings? (That have a tendency to cut rope)?   Two:  Thinking posting with more detail would be nice.  There really isn't anything in the OP that is the basis for figuring out what exactly happened.  Do the cuts in the sheath exhibit fraying or a nice clean cut?   Bottom line is that without more detail than provided~ I kinda think the OP was a bit irresponsible in posting this.  Although the climbers involved are supposedly 'too experienced to cut the rope' the one fact that appears out of this is that the rope was in fact cut.     On a side note I have often times noticed that most people tend to reflexively place the blame for something squarely on others (i.e. Edelrid) and/or assume others are acting out of stupidity without taking a good look at oneself.,Oct 2010,Jan 22 2015,0

5994,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,2,6, The age of the rope doesn't really matter for sheath damage like this.  Although thicker ropes (or ropes built to resist sheath abrasion) will do better~ toproping tends to put a lot of wear on ropes and it only takes one sharp edge to do something like this.  Red Rock tends to have a lot of lower angle climbs~ meaning the rope almost certainly was running over something~ not to mention the fact that a lot of fixed hardware can be old and worn.  Did your friend toprope directly off of the rings~ or use her own carabiners?  Either way~ the manufacturer is the last thing I would blame.,Jul 2014,Jun 1 2017,2
5995,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,2,7, In my many years of climbing I have had several ropes get trashed on the first few outings~ including the very first when a block dropped right on the rope. None have been because of the mfg. For both cases posted and as others have said the rope undoubtedly went over a sharp or rough edge. One may not think they were doing anything funky but a single bur while a rope is under tension will rip it to shreds. That is all on the rope  user. ,Jul 2007,Jun 1 2017,1

I used it a couple more times and I'm sure it was safe but it unnerved me~ so I cut 15 ft off both ends because it was a bi-pattern rope. My 60M became a 50M. ,Sep 2016,Jun 1 2017,0

6002,Multiple core shots on Edelrid Raptor after one sport climbing pitch,2,14, I was involved with a similar situation a few years ago with an Edelweiss which after 3 whole routes looked a lot worse than this rope.  I went back and inspected the top hardware to check for burrs~ etc.~ and there were none. The routes were overhanging so no edges to run over.  It was for sure a defective rope.  Unfortunately for my friend Dan the manufacturer failed to stand behind their product.  So~ these situations have happened at least one other time.  ,Jan 2006,Jun 1 2017,0

6006,Outdoor Research Helium II Review ,1,1, I find it best as a backup summer rain jacket. Always keep it in my daily bag for work/around town because Germany isn't exactly the dryest place. For climbing~ the same goes. For winter or heavier rain I like the Arc'teryx ALpha FL. A bit heavier yet~ but still light and its cut long with little foam inserts on the bottom sides to prevent it from riding up above your harness.,Mar 2015,May 26 2017,0
6007,Outdoor Research Helium II Review ,1,2, Yep~ in the winter I use the Procline Comp - softshell back for breathability~ hardshell front for soaking wet ice and falling snow. ,Dec 2016,May 29 2017,0
6008,Exxpozed and Telemark-Pyrenees,1,0, This isn't a gear review~ but an online retailer review. Some folks are finding deals on gear from overseas companies.    I ordered a set of Wild Country Superlite Offsets from Exxpozed. They arrived to me on the east coast exactly one week after ordering. I also ordered a pair of Fischer Transalp 80 skis from Telemark-Pyrenees. I ordered the skis last Sunday. They arrived that Wednesday. Couldn't be more satisfied. Both sites gave updates and tracking info just like ordering from anyone in the US.   For those who haven't ordered stuff from Europe~ VAT functions like a sales tax. You won't be charged VAT if ordering from the U.S.~ most of the time offsetting the increased cost of shipping. On the other hand~ you may be hit with import duties.,Oct 2007,Apr 13 2015,0
6009,Exxpozed and Telemark-Pyrenees,1,1, Be careful if you buy from out of Germany.  Besides the terms and condition states the will refund you the price of the product and the delivery cost the will not do it. Effects of withdrawal: If you withdraw from this contract~ we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you~ *** including the costs of delivery *** (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us).  They don't state that they will not reimburse international orders I will not buy again.,May 2017,May 5 2017,0
6010,Exxpozed and Telemark-Pyrenees,1,2, In Germany~ they're great. Given that I'm just a 2hr drive from their HQ~ I find their shipping slow~ sometimes takes a week for something and German domestic shipping takes 1 day~ maybe 2 max from anywher eto anywhere.  But their prices are good even if their website looks kinda crappy/clunky. Definitely a legit outfit with occasionally excellent deals. ,Mar 2015,May 13 2017,0
6011,Exxpozed and Telemark-Pyrenees,1,3, I ordered wild country helium draws from trekkinn because it was less than half the cost of anywhere else. I waited a month unfortunately for them to come but I think it got held up in customs. Glad they finally made it and got a killer deal!

6012,Epic Peak and U Craft Belay Glasses,1,0, I posted on another forum/thread about these two and I decided to buy them both to see. Epic Peak: http://amzn.to/2plh088 These are $21.99 as of writing~ made of black plastic with a non-slip type texture to them. Fairly light~ don't have a gram scale or anything~ but probably about 2-3oz or so. Came with an oversized hardshell case --case could easily take a pair of normal sunglasses-- which has a plastic clip on it. Either way~ the case will protect the glasses unless you manage to crush it. Straight FOV: The thick plastic frames under the prism do block a tad more than the Ti ones. But~ one could readily navigate around as what's going to probably be directly in front of you won't be blocked. Side FOV: Again~ thicker frames did not provide as much as the Ti ones looking straight out of your eye~ but looking around on the ground~ I did not see an issue.   UCraft (these have a Ti frame): http://amzn.to/2qeDZPy These were $49.99 when I had bought them~ sold out now though. Ti frames~ with typical soft rubber nose pieces~ plastic ear pieces. Came with a much smaller~ form fitting case~ a little tool kit~ and replacement nose pieces. Straight FOV: Of the two these were the best. The smaller frames allow for more of whats to be seen straight ahead at a greater distance~ could almost run around with these. Side FOV: Of the two these were the best~ but~ marginally. I did not experience as much of an impact on the side FOV with the thinner frames versus the thicker ones.   I actually did take these climbing. Prism wise they seemed to be about the same? Hard to say for me~ as this was my first set of them to try out. I have more pictures of the two side-by-side on a cutting mat with 1x1 grid. I'm going to return the Ti ones as the plastic ones do it for me.,Apr 2017,May 9 2017,0
6013,Epic Peak and U Craft Belay Glasses,1,1, $19.99 for the Epic Peak ones~ I did forget to mention that the one above has a lanyard~ these do not. :/ http://amzn.to/2q1bPdO,Apr 2017,May 9 2017,0
6014,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,0, My wife has had a pair of the CU glasses for about three years.  She has neck issues and swears they have extended her climbing career by relieving her chronic belayer's neck pain.  My neck is fine~ but I recently decided to buy a pair of glasses when I found that partners who used them just gave better belays while working projects. Figured I should reciprocate. What follows is my personal experience.    The CU belays were reviewed very well here- mountainproject.com/v/gear-…   Belay Specs share the same basic characteristics.  They are produced in Utah rathher than Germany and cost substantially less ($80 vs $150.)   Both share the same basic design~ a shaped metal frame supporting two prisms.  The prisms on the Bely Specs are a little bigger~ and the metal tray holding the prisms is correspondingly bigger and heavier.  This gives a slightly bigger field of view while looking through the prisms~ but also less peripheral vision. With the CU glasses I can typically peer over the frame for the first couple of clips~ with Belay Specs I prefer to leave them hanging on my neck till the climber is  a few bolts off the ground.  Not really a significant difference. The Belay Specs are heavier~ which becomes noticeable on the nose during long belay sessions.    Both come with plastic carrying cases. The CU case is a little nicer with tailored foam inserts~ but both work adequately.    Both come with keeper cords~ the Belay Specs are attached with heat shrink plastic in a choice of colors (you can pick cord color too.) Color choices are a nice touch and will be helpful as glasses are more widely used.    Ordering Belay Specs is easy on their website. As far as I can tell~ ordering CU Glasses requires leaving a message on the answering machine of the American distributor.    My wife has used her glasses for three years without any problems for that entire time~ except for one episode I'll describe below. One of the lenses of my first pair of Belay Specs fell off the very first time I used them.  My second pair is doing fine~ but it has only been a couple of weeks. So the durability question remains open for Belay Specs~ in my opinion.    Customer Service- when my Belay Specs broke~ Phil sent me a new pair immediately~ even before he received my broken ones in return~ even included cash to cover my shipping. Couldn't have been better.  When my wife first had her CU glasses~ one of the little silicone pieces covering the metal nosepiece disappeared. She contacted the American distributor who suggested she strip the insulation off some wire and replace it! This didn't seem reasonable for a pricey pair of glasses~ so she contacted Albi in Germany who promptly sent replacements plus a few extra pieces just in case.  Worked out OK~ but I wonder if Albi would still be as responsive. What's the bottom line?   Both glasses are good. You won't go wrong.    If you have a very sensitive nose or if money is no object~ then I suggest the CU Glasses~ for their lighter weight and proven record of durability.    If the thought of spending $150 on belay glasses makes you crazy~ then you can get a fine pair from Belay Specs and I really like the way they stand behind their product so far.  powernplayusa.com/ belayspecs.com/ Glasses with boxes Closer-up,Nov 2007,Oct 14 2012,0
6015,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,1, Great post Mark~ after spending a week at indian creek my neck was killing me. I can see a pair of these in my future and it's nice to know I don't have to shell out an arm and a leg.,Sep 2010,Oct 14 2012,0
6016,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,2, Thanks for the review Mark~ it seems pretty balanced and honest. Belay glasses~ whether Belay Specs or CUs~ are a great addition to any climbers pack. We started Belay Specs in part to try to bring them to a wider audience by making them more widely available and at a reasonable cost.   I'd like to address the durability issue that Mark mentioned. Mark was one of our first customers and on the first two dozen pairs of Belay Specs made we had an issue with the epoxy that bonds the frame and prisms together. We had made some small changes to our assembly procedure since our pre-production run that had caused poor the bonding. Once we detected the problem we were able to correct it and have contacted those affected to get them replacement product as needed.     I'd also like to point out that we have a 30-day money back guarantee on Belay Specs and as Mark said~ we work hard to take care of any issues our customers have. If you have any questions about Belay Specs please check out our website or send us an email.   Thanks~   Phil Wilkes  belayspecs.com,Oct 2012,Oct 15 2012,0

6023,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,9, Great review and write-up~ Mark. After a year of using some DIY belay glasses we purchased a pair of the CU glasses last year and have been very pleased with them (after getting over the sticker shock.) If I didn't already have the CU glasses~ I'd go with the Belay Specs.    A few years ago an acquaintance of ours had a small seizure while belaying. She'd never had any seizures like that before and the hypothesis was years of looking up while belaying had resulted in nerve issues in her neck~ I believe. I've often wondered if someone has done any research on the long-term effects of belaying. Nonetheless~ I certainly feel much better after a weekend of using belay glasses versus how I used to feel after looking up all weekend. I'm sold on belay glasses.,Oct 2005,Oct 25 2012,0

6028,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,14, I've owned a pair of the CU glasses for a couple of years now~ and all day yesterday I got to use a friend's Belay Specs.   The optical performance and the comfort of the Belay Specs was identical to my CU glasses (which is to say: excellent in both aspects).   My only complaint about the Belay Specs is the tether (the cord attached to the temples [arms] that goes around your neck). The cord is just a bit too short and makes it more difficult to get the glasses over your head while wearing a helmet.   This isn't a problem for the CU glasses as the tether is attached with sliding loops and so can be situated at the end of the temples.    However~ the Belay Specs attach the tether closer to the hinge with shrink tubing and thus the tether isn't adjustable. Making the cord about four inches longer would solve the issue for me.   Obviously this isn't a big issue and can be easily solved if~ like me~ you wear a helmet when belaying.,Oct 2005,Nov 22 2012,0
6029,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,15, Been using a pair of the CU glasses~ they are awesome.  The only issue that I've recently found is rockfall.  If your climber rips something off the wall or drops something on you~ its really hard to dodge it.  you see it coming through the glasses fine~ but no one has practiced dodging shit through a prism.  the time it takes to actually look up and reacquire the rock...yeah its awkward.  wear your helmet!  Not a deal breaker for me~ but just be aware.,May 2008,Nov 22 2012,0
6030,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,1,16, If you're interested in the CU glasses~ find a few others who want some and place a bulk order through Germany. We got 3 pairs at once and it came to $115 each~ after tax~ shipping~ duty~ etc~ etc.    Only issue I'd have with the Belay Specs~ by the sounds of it~ is having to leave them off for the first few clips.

Needless to say it was too much to pay attention to and a soft catch was not had :(   I would recommend using these things on easier routes with a fairly secure leader while getting used to them.

In total I probably got my spec about 2 weeks after ordering. Keep in mind that this was also shipping to Canada~ I would suspect it would take a lot less time to have them shipped in the USA.   And on that note~ if someone was looking for belay glasses in Canada - Belay Specs ships via USPS which doesn't charge the brokerage fees that someone like UPS charges. I also didn't get chaged with duties or anything of that sort either~ just straight shipping.,Mar 2012,Apr 5 2013,0

6053,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,2,18," I'd like to make some points on the investment in belay glasses based on experience.   I had been using CU's for 2 years til the prisms took such a beating from rocks hitting them~ being dropped on the way to putting them away in their case~ loaning them out to people who didn't know to use the keeper cord~ whatever. Eventually~ the prisms got to the point where there was so many scratches and chips that interfered with vision- I simply wore them out. At $160 a pop~ well~ I didn't much like the arithmetic. True~ the temples lasted just fine~ tho that's not what really wears on belay glasses.   2.5 years ago I decided to try Mike's because~ quite frankly~ they were so much less money. Also~ they were the only other glasses out there then. Here's what I found then and since. All belay glasses require looking around the prisms~ and~ to some extent~ around the frames and arms. It's a skill that you learn when you get your CU's~ Belay Specs~ Belaggles~ or Mike's- this isn't guesswork here~ I've used them all. Blind to ground level conditions? I haven't had any problems with that at all~ you just tilt your head a little and look underneath- duh.   Another thing I've found. The more you spend for belay glasses- I agree- the lighter the package seems (mostly because the prisms are smaller) and the added bonus of being able to wear other glasses on top of them if you need- I don't so this is a nonstarter for me. The Mike's I've used have been thru the wars. The prisms are starting to get chipped~ but not yet to the point that I can't see using them another year or so (maybe it's the sheer size of the prisms~ I don't know). The hinges and arms have been blasted~ and yes ""impacted""~ and show no problems. So I don't know what ""actual"" experience others have had with them~ but this has been mine.   Something else to note. I climb an average of some 240 days a year; virtually every climb~ the glasses are used. That's an awful lot of pitches and use.   So~ my point seems to be is this~ if you expect that the service life of belay glasses will outlive the climbing life of their owner's- I've got another think for you on this point. Based on experience and that of my friends~ I really wouldn't expect to get more then 3-4 years worth of use from any glasses.",Apr 2010,May 11 2014,0

6055,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,3,0, The best thing about belay glasses is that they keep the belayer's focus on the climber. Go to any climbing gym or crag where they're in use and look at the belayers. The ones wearing belay glasses are focused on the climber and the others~ well~ they may be focused on just about anything.    Belay glasses could be the best belay safety device ever.    Climb safe~   Mal,Jan 2001,May 11 2014,0
6056,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,3,1, I hear comments about the about peripheral vision often when talking with climbers and customers about their experience with Belay Specs and other brands of belay glasses. Personally~ I think the more peripheral vision you have the better but obviously some people are able to make do with slightly less.    brucy brings up a good point about the durability of prismatic belay glasses. With enough use and abuse~ the prisms can get damaged to the point where they loose functionality. As brucy alludes to~ some damage to the prism can be tolerated and the glasses still function well. We recognized the vulnerability of the prisms early on and designed our frames to try to prevent the prisms from being the first thing to hit if they were dropped. I think other designs attempt to do the same as the risk is pretty obvious. Unlike other brands however~ we do have a prism replacement program. For $20~ we'll replace the prisms~ reform the frame if necessary~ replace worn out temple and nose padding and ship them back to you. We would rather repair a product than have it thrown into a landfill and replaced with a new pair. We've done less than half a dozen repairs since we started selling Belay Specs which gives you an idea of the durability.    Malcom - I was talking with a local gear shop owner and he made a related comment. He used to have lots of people talking to him while he belayed at the gym being a well known person in the community. Since he stared wearing Belay Specs~ people don't talk to him nearly as often because they can't see his eyes and don't feel engaged in the conversation. I do agree that belay glasses can greatly increase the attention payed by the belayer to the climber.,Oct 2012,May 11 2014,0
6057,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,3,2, These are a good addition to climbing equipment~ and I agree with Malcolm that they make climbing~ especially in distracting environments~ safer.

6063,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,3,8, I really like my Mikes.

6066,A brief comparison between Belay Specs and CU Belay Glasses,3,11, After almost 2.5 years~ a prism popped off my belay specs. Surprisingly~ it wasn't from any impact; it just slipped off sometime when I had it in it's case.   I contacted them and Phil was quick to respond. Apparently they had a few issues with the production from that time period but have since modified their production to reduce the incidents.   I shipped them my broken belay specs and quickly received a new pair at no cost. Very satisfied with the support~ and still so with the product.   I have tried on many other new brands since this post began~ and quite a few of them are generally great. But I continue to find the field of vision of belay specs best for me over my corrective lenses; as well as the arms most comfortable.,May 2014,Jun 1 2015,0

Just putting these things on your nose is a pleasure!  They're not a bother to my face at all~ and I can still see around them to be aware of my surroundings and ensure I have good ground control while I'm lead belaying.

6079,Berghaus Hyper 100,1,0," I have had this jacket for a little over a month now~ so I thought I'd share some thoughts with you. The Berghaus Hyper 100 is billed as the first 3 layer~ sub 100g shell. What that is advertised as meaning is that it is more durable and breathable than similar 2 layer jackets. My experience has held up that view to a point. Previously I carried an Arc'teryx Squamish wind jacket and a Marmot Essence shell. The Essence is a great piece: $200 retail~ stretchy~ air permeable~ 7 oz~ and it has pit vents that are always open~ encouraging airflow. The Hyper 100 has replaced both of these. Features: one small zippered pocket inside. That's about it. No hood adjustment~ no hem adjustment~ no hand pockets~ no cuff adjustment. Breathability: The Hyper 100 is breathable. Most shells are ""breathable"" in the sense that once it reaches 100% relative humidity inside the jacket~ they start transferring moisture vapor out of the membrane. The need to reach 100% humidity leads to the clammy feeling lots of folks experience with cheap shells. Fabrics like Neoshell~ eVent DVL~ and the fabric of the Marmot Essence are air permeable~ thus allowing air exchange before the inside of the jacket becomes a sauna. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy36ejEQX_M In side by side breath tests~ I can blow (with difficulty) approximately the same rate of air through the Essence and the Hyper 100. I have gone on 55 degree trail runs~ and though it's certainly not as nice as a wind shell~ it's reasonable. Stretch: The Hyper 100 stretches. This is great for a piece that might be used when climbing. Weight: The hyper 100 in a medium is advertised at 3.4 ounces. The only other 3 layer shell approaching that weight I know of is the NWAlpine Eyebright that is $600. However~ I found that this is the one jacket I have ever tried on that necessitated going with a size large. That takes the weight up just a bit. I have a conspiracy theory that they sized it small to hit their 100g target for a medium~ as I believe the size large goes just over 100g. That brings me to... Fit: The jacket is snug. More snug than any other shell I've worn. The size medium fit like a small~ and I had to size up to a large. I am 5'11"" and 174 pounds. I wear a size medium jacket in every other brand I have ever tried. Durability: the jacket is 3 layer~ and Berghaus says it will be more than three times as durable as their prior light jacket~ the Hyper Smock. I admit that the fabric does concern me. It will not be as durable as something like an Arc'teryx Alpha. But so far~ I have had no problems. And this jacket weighs 1/3 what an Alpha weighs. Something like an Alpha is heavy enough that I will not pack it if the weather is likely going to be nice. I now feel I can pack this waterproof jacket just in case. Price: I believe the jacket will retail for $300-325 in the US. I got mine for $241 total shipped from Europe. This is at the mid range for a shell. Concerns: Durability~ as already mentioned. Few features. The hood must go under a helmet~ though that is what I prefer anyway for the typically less binding feeling it gives. The zipper is a standard coil zipper: not waterproof---there is a flap behind the zipper that provides a barrier to rain. At sub-4 ounces~ the Hyper 100 is a piece that I will never leave at home. Even if just to have a wind layer that can do more if necessary. Whether going for a 3 hour trail run or climbing on a marginal day with a 30 or 40% chance of rain~ it'll be with me.

6080,Arcteryx Proton AR? Atom AR?,1,0, Anyone here tried or fondled an Arcteryx Proton AR? I'm looking for an outer/mid layer for climbing between 15-20k'. I like the Atom LT but it doesn't seem warm enough for those altitudes~ Nano Air even worse as the wind goes right through it. The Atom AR might be better but it doesn't look like it will breath. I really hate wearing a hard shell if I can help it. Ideas?,Oct 2011,Apr 23 2017,0
6081,Arcteryx Proton AR? Atom AR?,1,1, I've been curious about the Proton series as well.  Personally~ I own an Atom AR and I would sweat to death if I actively climbed in it/used it as my mid/outer layer. However~ I've never been to the 15-20k elevations~ so I guess my assessment of the Atom AR might be a little off. The Proton AR and OR Uberlayer are about the same insulation weights that are comparable.,Mar 2011,Apr 23 2017,0
6082,Arcteryx Proton AR? Atom AR?,1,2," My limited perspective from swapping between an Atom AR / Proton AR / Cerium LT at an Arc'teryx store the other day - with the caveat that I obviously didn't get to go jogging in either~ so I can't give any sort of rigorous comment on breathability~ which I know is your central question.  Proton AR definitely felt a little less ""warm"" than the Atom AR or Cerium LT~ but it's hard to compare synthetic to down since down usually feels warmer right away. I can't honestly say whether the Atom AR felt ""warmer"" than the Proton AR moreso than just ""stuffier""~ if that makes sense. Proton AR felt the most rugged and breathable~ while Cerium definitely felt the least rugged. Atom AR felt a little more roomy for layering.   Personally I already own a Nano Air and Squamish Hoody - I didn't feel that either the Atom AR or Proton AR were different enough to push me away from this combo~ however I'm not going above 14k anytime soon. The Proton AR could definitely be the step up in warmth that you're looking for while still retaining a decent amount of breathability.",Sep 2016,Apr 24 2017,0

6086,Y&Y Belay Glasses,1,3, Until one of these companies makes a set that can adjust the angle of the prism (this would be easy to do but would require a bit more than just glasses frame)~ they are all the same and are all copycats.   Don't get me wrong~ I love my Belay Specs. They are totally copycats too. I am happy the CU got mimicked by so many~ their price was absurd.   How about it companies? Anyone willing to put your prisms on a pivot? That would be an actual improvement and would give you justifiable reason to sell at a higher price than the herd.   FWIW~ I emailed Belay Specs my idea and the email wasn't returned. Somebody should take it and run.,Oct 2012,Nov 18 2014,0
6087,Y&Y Belay Glasses,1,4, I've been using belay glasses for about a year and love'em. I'd like to see a comprehensive comparison among the various manufacturers. There are four that I know of (CU~ Belaggles~ these and one made in Utah) My CU Belay Glasses have smaller prisms that these. Is that a bug or a feature? How do hinges compare to no hinge designs? If any of you have tried multiple manufacturers~ what are your thoughts? Since we're mostly buying these online~ you can't easily compare one to the other.,Jul 2003,Nov 18 2014,0

6090,Y&Y Belay Glasses,1,7, To mention a cheaper alternative~ the Belay Shades seem like a solid choice. I just purchased a pair this weekend. I have used the Belaggles in the past and the build quality of the Belay Shades is slightly lesser~ but at $40 vs. Belaggles at $90~ I am very satisfied.    The functionality of all the models seems similar~ so some of the $90-$120 frames are a little overpriced in my opinion. The Y&Ys are $80 on Amazon~ by the looks of it.    Major differences between models seem to be in the look/color options and the field of view in the front and sides.,May 2010,Nov 18 2014,0

6096,Y&Y Belay Glasses,1,13, I misplaced my belay specs and got a pair of Y&Ys for gym season this year.    The Y&Ys have smaller prisms and are noticeably lighter for that reason. They fit in front of eyeglasses more or less that same as belay specs~ but feel like they are going to stay on better because they weigh less.    The smaller prism results in it being easier to look over the glasses to check on knots~ follow climber progress for the the first few feet. etc.    The through prism field of view is smaller~ but seems adequate.,Feb 2010,Dec 2 2014,0

6099,Y&Y Belay Glasses,1,16, There is climbing season~ and then there gym season. Gym is not climbing~  rather a methadone-esque substitute. Side effects include~ but are not limited to~ tweeked pulleys and general malaise (aka gym fever). Proper application of sports tape can mitigate the effects of tweeked pulleys. Gym fever is a more serious disorder. Its affects are more noticeable among the traditional climber population. It can only be treated by avoiding the gym altogether~ or by periods of treatment at rehabilitation facilities such as Joshua tree National Park or Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.,Feb 2010,Dec 3 2014,2

They are trying to solve a problem I don't have. i haven't seen this thread for a while. I've had the opportunity to try some different belay glasses since my last post.

6106,Y&Y Belay Glasses,2,2, I too have belay specs and Y&Y. For me~ I like the belay specs wider field of vision~ but they are heavier on the face~ so on all other counts~ especially lightness~ compactness and carryability the Y&Y wins.,Mar 2009,Apr 23 2017,0
6107,Y&Y Belay Glasses,2,3," I bought a pair of these after seeing others at the gym wear them. I'm having issues with neck muscle spasms so the less I crane my neck back and keep it there~ the better They fit over a pair of wire frame glasses~ though the ear pieces do take some maneuvering to lay comfortably over/next to the other. The only thing I've noticed is there's a bit of an adjustment period to get use to being able to see in front of you~ as well as above you. There's a certain point in the climb~ the climber appears in both 'frames"" and its a bit disorientating at first. The relief off my neck is amazing~ so I'd say these were a good buy. ",Oct 2016,Apr 23 2017,0
6108,Y&Y Belay Glasses,2,4, I noticed that when I first used them. Keep them on the very tip of your nose until the 2nd clip or so and that is reduced since it gives you a wider field up w/o the prism in view. ,Jan 2015,Apr 24 2017,0
6109,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,1,0, Just thought I'd pass along a few thoughts.   I bought a full set of the Totem Aliens last fall~ and just added to it the 2 smallest sizes from Fixe (on sale at Mountain Gear for the next couple of weeks for the same price as the Totem ones) to fill in the low end.   My thoughts?   The totem version seems to be better made IMO. The entire unit just seems more finished. The cam wires on the Totems seems more durable than the wire on the Fixes. The action is also smoother on the Totems.   So~ if you are looking at aliens~ look at the totems. They cost less~ and feel great. They also ship from inside the US so they get there pretty fast.,Apr 2011,Jul 19 2012,0

6116,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,1,7," I bought mine directly from Totem. Fast shipping.   Good call on comparing the same size...unfortunately I don't have them in the same sizes.   One notable difference is the axle-ends. On the totem cams~ they shaved off 1/4-1/8 of an inch on each side making it way better for shallow placements. This is the same on the Fixe green/yellow/red. I've attached a picture showing the blue Fixe and a Green Totem for reference...  Fixe and Totem alien SxS   I also have one of the standard (non-basic) Totem cams in a ~#1 camalot size. Pretty cool but I've actually started to not like it as much because it is SO flexible I have trouble placing it the way I want to.   FWIW~ both of my lead falls in the past 8 months have been caught by my Totem basic cams -- once on the yellow and once on a green. The lobes are slightly dented on the ones that caught me (you can see if you look closely at the picture)~ but they are still in excellent shape. One of the falls was in a downward flaring crack and it held very nicely.   All of the standard ""Aliens rock"" stuff applies -- my friend was leading on my rack and couldnt' stop raving about how awesome the aliens were (we jut call em aliens even though they're Totem). They are narrow~ place wonderfully etc.",Apr 2011,Jul 19 2012,0
6117,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,1,8, +1 for Totem Basics.    I agree with most comments above~ the action is slightly smoother on the yellow/red compared to the gray which are similar in size.

6120,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,1,11," I have all three ""iterations"" even thought they are different sizes (so slight different designs).   Black CCH   Blue Fixe   Yellow Totem   Totem is WAYYY smoother than either.    Out of all the sheath designs I think that the original metal interior with nylon outside has the potential for being the longest lasting. The thicker threads on the fixe sheath was def a good call for durability.    The decision to go with the wire rope instead of solid wires I think it great since I've found those metal wires are easily bent.",Oct 2011,Aug 27 2012,0

6126,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,1,17, I ended up getting the green~ yellow~ and red Basics to double up on small cam sizes. The 3 cams cover the sizes without any gap. Since I already have and I am happy with Master Cams~ to me it made sense to get 3 Basics instead of 4 Aliens to cover the sizes.   I placed all three of them this weekend. No falls~ but I bounced on them a bit. I'm happy with them because the sizes are a bit different from the Master Cams so they compliment each other nicely. Also~ I felt confident climbing above the placements. Finally~ I really like the giant thumb loops and slightly enlarged slings~ it might help prevent walking.,Mar 2009,Jan 21 2013,0

6134,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,2,4," MP Friends~    I know some of you are craving to get your Totem's on. I contacted Totem with a few questions thinking of this entire thread. Here you go~ for those that are interested. This is in reference to the Totem Basic Cams (Alien style)~ not the Totem Cams.   -------------------------------   Hi Jason:   I will answer your question:   Q: Do you have any time frame on when the web store will reopen?   A: We really hope to re-open the web store in the last week of July estimated. Q: The Main Page of your website shows the Newest of the Basic Cam lineup~ the Blue~ and another of the updated Red. Will the Green~ Yellow and Hybrids also have the Updates (Improved Teeth~ Trigger Bar Color~ etc)? If so~ when do they planned to be released?   A: All our new basic cams are been manufactured with the last improvements. Q:If I order cams from either backcountrygear.com or gearcoop.com (the only two sites I have found that sells Totems)~ will they be the updated cams~ or the previous generation?   A: I´am sure that in these places they haven´t got the updated design yet. Q: Can you update your website~ specifically concerning photographs as well as specifications for the Blue Basic Cam and the Blue/Green Hybrid Basic Cam? Also~ for us non-metric Americans~ can you have a conversion chart?   A: We are working on the website. Soon we will update all the info and photos. We are working full time with production~ day only has 24 hours... it´s a busy time for us.   Here are the Basic Cams in Inches:   Totem Basic Blue 0.50: 0.44""-0.68""   Totem Basic Blue/Green Hybrid: 0.60 HY: 0.53""-0.68""   Totem Basic Green 0.65: 0.53""-0.84""   Totem Basic Green/Yellow Hybrid: 0.70 HY: 0.65""-0.84""   Totem Basic Yellow 0.75:  0.65""-1.02""   Totem Basic Yellow/Red Hybrid 0.85 HY: 0.78""-1.02""   Totem Basic Red 0.95: 0.78""-1.24""   Thank you so much   Best regards   Unai Arrieta   ______________________ Gear Coop says they have the updated versions.

Pictures on their website are still the old models but I got mine in the mail yesterday and all are the updated version! Like everyone has said~ quality looks fantastic.

6159,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,3,9, I've had mine for 2 years~ fallen on both a yellow and green. They are holding up very well~ and both falls held great. One was even in a downward-facing flaring thing~ and it took a pretty solid fall.   I have a blue mastercam (and purple) and it is just a little smaller than the green totem.

Now have 1 set of basics~ one set of CCH/fixe (both sets up to red) and TCUs up to orange. I find more versatility in having a set of TCUs to compliment the 4 cam pieces. rather than a set of MCs.

6168,Totem vs. Fixe Aliens,3,18," Please explain to me the units of ""holding power"" before you whack jobs go too far.  There is a lot of BS psuedo science thrown around by folks who clearly have never taken a physics class in their life (or failed miserably) about cam angles.   In short~ there is no ""right"" cam angle~ and what we have are compromises to work across a range of conditions.  To listen to a lot of you wing nuts one could wonder by there aren't <10 degree cam angles out there to get even more Holding Power (7 Minute Abs!).   Metolius uses 12 degrees~ and harder~ often narrower lobes (at least their master cams). The small cam angle puts more outward force for the same downward force with a hard lobe.  Better right?  For hard smooth rock~ yes probably.  For weaker rock like sandstone this is more likely to crush the top layer of rock resulting in a layer of granules that act as ball bearings~ which can be bad.   On the other extreme are aliens with a 16 degree cam angle and (would you believe) 6061-T6~ a fairly soft alloy.  Less outward force~ and softer lobes.  The cams wear out faster just thrashing around your rack and getting beat up on C1 aiding.  In soft rock the lobes conform to the texture avoiding the ball bearing issue.  But on hard smooth guano polished granite~ they are the ONLY cam I have had that folded up and sucked out of the bottom of a parallel crack under body weight.   It all goes back to Jardine' orignal analysis that showed that 10 degrees put too much force on the rock~ pulverizing mediocre rock~ and 18 degrees was too much and could skitter out of smooth hard rock.  As a result you see lots of 14-15 degrees cams as a compromise for good came range with good performance across a wide range of rock types~ and a couple wing nut manufacturers who go closer the the extremes for their own reason.  Then you have a lot of internet arm-chair nut jobs regurgitating marketing pseudo-science like fools.",Dec 2007,Nov 16 2013,0

6200,cypher quickdraw reviews,1,0, what is your favorite quickdraw from cypher? If they are all about the same~ I will get the cheapest ones which are the cypher ceres II and the firefly II. Are the Cypher vesta sport draws with tre extra money?,Apr 2017,Apr 8 2017,0
6201,cypher quickdraw reviews,1,1, The cypher firefly II mix were my second rack of draws (and first rack to match...)... I liked them a lot~ and still use them every now and then to either shave a few grams(rarely)~ or when I just need a couple more draws (often). They are not especially high performance sport draws (biners and slings are both too small)~ but don't suck either. Good all around draw~ at a pretty good weight and a killer price point.  A buddy of mine uses the Echo mix and Echo wiregate draws. Haven't noticed enough of a difference to recommend the extra money on them.  The Vesta sport draws will offer slightly higher sport climbing performance~ but the biners are still too small to perform as well something like a Petzl Spirit~ Petzl Djinn~ BD Nitron~ or BD Livewire. And they're heavier. I'd not recommend it at all... the firefly is a better all around draw~ and the for the price of the Vesta you could get something better.,Nov 2012,Apr 8 2017,0
6202,cypher quickdraw reviews,1,2, I own and use lots of different brands and the Cypher draws are better than most people give them credit for. They are often (maybe always) the same carabiners that Trango uses. I like the Vesta Sport for sport climbing. The fat dogbone is nice to grab onto when hangdogging and is more stable for quick clips. I like the Ceres II for trad and ice climbing. Good carabiners and reasonably light design. ,Aug 2011,Apr 10 2017,0
6203,cypher quickdraw reviews,1,3, Had the vesta sport which were great for general sport climbing. They didn't work well in the squid for stick clipping but I don't/didn't own one so no big deal. Got a great deal here on wild country heliums so sold the cyphers here as well. Turns out the heliums don't work well with my beta stick but I do have one other draw so it's fine. ,Jun 2015,Apr 10 2017,0
6204,cypher quickdraw reviews,1,4, Climbed many pitches on a set of Firefly II (actually a different name branded on them~ but the same biners/draws). They work fine~ I have no complaints. If you are exclusively sport climbing and have extra $ there are nicer draws out there~ but the price/value ratio starts falling. ,Aug 2011,Apr 11 2017,0

It's amazing how smooth it lowers. I found that for some situations one doesn't even need to run a sling with redirect to lower~ can just manipulate it by simply lifting up slightly on the correct end of the device.   One of my ice partners was a little concerned how well it would work with the skinny ropes we use on ice~ but it handles the 7.8 mm doubles just fine.,Jun 2013,Jun 9 2016,0

6215,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,10, Thanks for reading the review.    We used WordPress.org to set up our website.    I was so stoked on the Pivot I wanted it to be the first product reviewed. It really is an improvement in every category over the ATC guide and the Petzl Reverso. It was very easy to lower my follower a whole pitch applying gentle pressure.,Jun 2014,Jun 9 2016,0

6217,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,12, No.  Not at all like your ATC Guide.  The Grigri is not a hands free autoblocking device~ and treating it the same as an ATC guide will get somebody killed~ especially if you use a thinner rope.  Petzl explicitly does NOT recommend using a Grigri for a direct belay and recommends instead a redirect belay.  The Grigri is designed to lock under a dynamic load (leader fall) and in the break position; hanging a Grigri upside down does not achieve this~ and if you let go of the break hand~ it is very possible for the rope to creep.  Basically~ if you have a rope that feeds well for leading~ it's not going to be safe for belaying a second.   Anyways~ saw one of these on sale from Backcountry with the carabiner for $30 and decided to go for it...love the thing.  Pretty incredible how well it lowers~ which IMO is worth replacing your ATC Guide or Reverso.,Jul 2014,Jun 26 2016,0
6218,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,13, i never understood why the dmm pivot is better at lowering than the atc guide. it pivots roughly in the same area.,Oct 2012,Jun 27 2016,0

6220,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,15, So~ does the Pivot not require a backup to lower~ or is it still needed/recommended?,Feb 2016,Jun 27 2016,0
6221,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,16, Rich~ the hole that you hang the device onto your masterpoint moves (pivots)~ opening up the device to release the load.  I don't believe a redirect is needed~ but that's a really good question.  Anyone know?,Jul 2014,Jun 27 2016,0

6223,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,18, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong (something~ presumably)~ but I haven't found the DMM Pivot to be all that much easier for lowering than a BD ATC Guide. It still usually requires applying a fair bit of force for a decent length of time in an awkward direction (maybe 30-40lbs outward at roughly shoulder level).   After a couple times using it to lower~ I decided it was just faster and easier to use the method I've always used with the ATC Guide (i.e.~ redirect connected to my belay loop~ with a friction backup on the brake strand).,Apr 2013,Jun 27 2016,0
6224,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,1,19," Haha...yeah~ those directions are a bit cryptic~ but I interpreted as "";OK to use as it's setup~ just don't crank on it like a horny rabbit or else you'll end up as turtle soup."";  I also love how you can tell that they're from Wales because all of the examples show twin ropes...   My one gripe is that the hole is rather size specific if you want to use a carabiner to leverage it.  I could fit a Nano 22 but not a Neutrino.",Jul 2014,Jun 27 2016,0

6240,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,2,14, Got a chance to really use the pivot in the field...have to say I'm loving it.  Very smooth handling for belaying~ autoblock~ rappelling~ and super light weight.,Jul 2014,Jul 7 2016,0
6241,Trouble lowering your second in guide mode? DMM pivot review,2,15, So...as an update FWIW:   I've been using the Pivot for the past year or so and have been loving it.  Despite its light weight compared to an ATC Guide~ it's held up well and handles very smoothly when belaying~ rappelling~ autoblock~ etc.  Even swapped it with my Grigri for a gym session or two and caught heavier climbers than me without any slippage.    I finally got around to lowering someone in autoblock mode~ and it worked well~ although this was with a 9.4mm.  It felt a lot like lowering someone with a Grigri~ using the release biner as you would the Grigri brake lever~ and I managed to lower a climber down a full 100' pitch.   IMO~ it's worth the upgrade from an ATC Guide or Reverso.  Being able to slowly release the autoblock is very handy~ particularly if you usually belay your second up off the anchor.,Jul 2014,Apr 10 2017,1
6242,Hiking/Climbing bags??,1,0, I'm about to buy a hiking bag but can't decide on a size I've been looking at the Gregory 75~65 stout to carry my climbing gear (ropes~draws~towel hammock and lunch. possibly for  1-3 day long trips  but mostly day trips but I also plan getting my hands on trad gear this summer so I don't want to go to small but most of my trips will be a day or two long help please,May 2016,Apr 7 2017,0
6243,Hiking/Climbing bags??,1,1," There is no ""one size fits all"" backpack.  For day trips with climbing gear~ you can go with around 40L (especially since you are carrying a hammock and~ uh~ towel). Some people will advocate for smaller packs~ such as 20-30L~ but you'll be hard-pressed to get everything on the inside. For overnight trips with climbing gear~ you'd probably want around 60L. For multiday trips with climbing gear~ you could go larger~ depending on how long you will be out and how much gear you have. Edit: As time goes on~ you will accumulate multiple backpacks~ so that you have the correct size for your objective. ",Nov 2009,Apr 7 2017,1
6244,Hiking/Climbing bags??,1,2, My thought is that providing you don't want to wear the pack up a multipitch~ bigger is not a problem. I've got a 90L that I can use for cragging~ long approaches~ or backpacking. But I'd never take it up a route with me. If I use it to carry gear to the base of a multipitch~ I carry a small stowable pack for the climb. One of those REI packs that folds into it's own hood. That takes care of food~ water~ jacket~ etc. If I don't want to leave anything at the base~ possibly because the descent is in a different direction~ I take a 35-40L that can be cinched down to a lower profile~ so it doesn't get in the way too much. If it's too big and bulky~ it will be annoying.,Jun 2014,Apr 7 2017,0

6247,5.10 VXI sizing,1,0, Hi    I am trying to purchase a pair of the team VXI~ but not sure about the sizing. I am currently in a pair of 6.5 team black and 7 old blackwing. Could someone help me out here?    THanks,Oct 2015,Mar 29 2017,0
6248,5.10 VXI sizing,1,1, I own the XVI~ but none of the other shoes. I wear a size 11.5 street shoe and the size 11 XVI fits me well. A size 11.5 might work well too~ someone with a wide foot would almost definitely need a size 11.5. I hope that comparison helps. Actually now that I think about it~ Five Ten sizing seems pretty standard across most of the models/lasts that I've tried. If I want a tight fit I go with a size 11. If I want a more loose fit I bump to 11.5. I have the Quantum's in a size 12 since the sole is super stiff and I bought them for all day multi-pitch comfort.,Aug 2011,Apr 7 2017,0

6256,Does anyone use <9.5 mm rope for cragging? ,1,6, I use a 9.4 petzl fuse quite frequently~ but if I'm gonna be setting up TR's for others I'll bring a 9.8 or higher.  It's pretty much a trade-off between ease and durability.  A skinnier rope generally provides more elongation (a softer fall)~ but will take far fewer falls before it needs to be retired versus a thicker rope.  That's why a 9.8 will have a higher fall rating (# of falls) compared to a 9.4.  My opinion: if you have the money to replace your ropes more frequently and pay careful attention to their condition~ it's very nice climbing on skinny ropes.,May 2009,Dec 28 2009,1

6260,Does anyone use <9.5 mm rope for cragging? ,1,10, I frequently go craggin with my Fuse (9.4)~ made by Petzl. Although some people claim that skinnier ropes have 'less falls' rated~ this is irrelivant. A single rope has to pass a minimum of 5 factor two falls (a.k.a only possible in a multipitch situation.)    Since you asked about 'cragging'~ I assume you are talking mostly of single pitch sport or trad. If this is the case~ even taking relatively large falls~ (such as a fall of 20ft when 80ft of rope is paid out) will generate a fall factor of .25~ of which your rope can do hundreds of times.    If you like something that is a little thinner~ there is nothing wrong with using it cragging. Just be aware the skinnier ropes DO wear out quicker. While they might be just as strong as many thicker ropes~ their sheaths are usually thinner and will wear through quicker. That's just the ways it is~ you cannot have it all!

6262,Does anyone use <9.5 mm rope for cragging? ,1,12, One thing to keep in mind is whether you intend to top-rope with it.  As someone pointed out above~ the skinny ropes stretch a lot giving the leader a nice soft catch.  If you intend to lead a pitch~ lower~ and then have someone TR it~ this can lead to some big TR falls because of all the rope out.  Not really a big deal~ just something to be aware of and factor in as part of the trade-off with thicker ropes.,Aug 2002,Dec 29 2009,0
6263,Does anyone use <9.5 mm rope for cragging? ,1,13, I'll add to the recommendations for the Petzl Fuse. It's the first 9.4mm rope I've used for cragging~ and I'm hooked on skinny cords now. I've got a more in depth review here: splitterchoss.com/2009/06/2…   One thing to keep in mind is that Gri Gri's aren't really supposed to be used on ropes skinnier than 9.8~ so we often use a Trango Cinch with our 9.4. Your mileage may vary.,Aug 2006,Mar 13 2010,0
6264,Does anyone use <9.5 mm rope for cragging? ,1,14, Skinnies are great~ they do the job~ they're nice to hike and belay with~ and they pay off on longer pitches.   They do wear out faster.  Both on the sheath and at the spot 15 feet from the end where you're getting caught on short sport type falls.  You know~ the spot that gets flat and noodley first.     As has been stated~ top rope and top rope dogging will beat up a skinny much faster.   That said~ skinnies are great.  They are light and they will catch you~ many times.  If you're doing super sport dogging/working/whipping~ I'd get a bigger rope~ but if you're just taking falls here and there~ and not doing a ton of toproping~ the skinny is the way to go.  It's nice to have both.   If you have the funding and the willingness to do it~ it's nice to just use skinnies and replace them more frequently.,Nov 2006,Mar 15 2010,0

No major fraying seen and we even use it over slabs and other friction hot spots.  I've taken several falls on it with no flat-spotting.  It does twist up~ but probably just because of the way we coil it and don't allow it to untwist while hanging frequently.   I would say the complete opposite about the petzl fuse.  It core shot the first day out and got very stiff after just a few months.  Maybe this is an older design~ but I would be wary.,Jun 2009,Oct 11 2010,0

6283,review of all the non-locking carabiners that I own,1,0, So I've been climbing for ~9 years now~ and have gone from buying the cheapo BD nonlockers~ to going for the most expensive~ and have used a variety on my rack at the same time. Here is the results of my years/months of using these non-locking karabiners.   This review covers    WC helium~ WC astro~ DMM chimera~ BD hotwire~ mad rock ultralight bent gate~ camp photon wire straight~ BD positron bent and straight~ some old and prob discontinued BD non-keylock design   metolius FS mini~ BD nuetrino~ camp nano~ BD and omega pac. oval~     First off~ the tiny biners~ I got a couple of them at first thinking they would be good on alpine rock runners to cut down weight~ but they suck for that~ they arent heavy enough to hold down the runner and it flops around and gets tangled. Then I put them as cam racking biners~ one per cam~ they are all fine for that purpose~ I cant tell them apart~ even the slightly bigger BD nuetrino doesnt seem any better. Sometimes I look at the nuetrinos and think they are bigger~ must be easier to use~ but I honestly never ever notice while plugging a cam at a crux move.   Which brings me to the meat of the review...    by far my favorite of all the biners I've used is the WC helium (33 grams) ~ which shouldn't be a surprise for anyone.    I have them rope side on my shoulder length slings. The gate opens with almost no effort~ but by some amazing engineering feat snaps back perfectly after the rope. They are light~ but somehow substantial~ they hold the sling just enough to keep it from flopping around while racked on the harness.They sit great in the hand no matter how you grab them. I've had a few since maybe last summer~ I love em~ My only complaint is that they are never on sale and cost a bunch.   WC astro (29 grams)... eh~ whatever~ I dont like them a ton~ but I dont particularly dislike them. I have em gear end on my runners. They have decent action on the gate~ and they clip just fine into gear~ however~ when I'm at my limit~ 10 feet past my last piece~ trying to smash the stupid biner into a cam sling~ the gate is annoyingly small. Not impossible to get in~ just annoying.    DMM chimera (30 g)~ I like them a lot~ I got one a few months ago~ and I think they kick ass~ they are way bigger than the astro~ but are only 1 gram more~ which is totally worth it~ I mean 12 draws with gear side as chimera vs astro~ 12 grams~ its certainly worth it for me to clip that much easier. My only complaint~ the nose on the chimera is wider than the astro~ yeah it makes them stronger~ but its not hard to keep the biners from being nose loaded unless one is somewhat of an idiot...I havent had nose width  be an issue yet~ but I can imagine real situations where that would suck~ multiple biners on one bolt for example.   BD hotwire (43 grams) this biner kind of sucks~ I got them many years ago~ they were an improvement over the very bottom of the barred solid gate BD positrons~ but the gate just doesnt pop open nicely compared to the fancy ones. And they are heavy~ bleh. I first noticed how much I didnt like them when I had them racked as rope side with the same gear side biners as the helium~ then it was so obvious how crappy these things are   mad rock ultralight bent gate~ camp photon wire straight (weight unknown~ I'm too lazy to look it up)... I dont like these~ I bootied them~ on mt Whitney last summer~ they were pretty well used when I found them~ and I preferentially clip the whole bootied runner into bolts~ beacuse I dont care about dinging the hell out of them. The gates suck~ they are sticky~ stiff and annoying. No worse than the hotwires though~ and if I was not going for the fancy heliums and chimeras or another top end biner these would be ok.   BD positrons~ (heavy as all hell~ 49 grams)... I hate these things. They are heavy. They clip ok~ but at 20(!) grams more than the astro~ I mean~ the mass adds up fast~ 12 biners = 240 grams~ thats more than half a pound~ it makes a difference.   Ovals... heavy~ classic~ annoying~ and will always live on my harness in some purpose or another. They are better than the others for certain self rescue situations~ and hold more gear.

I like ovals for symmetry like on a pulley~ and I do feel very 1970s with them.    I have read the WC heliums are the best. I have the astros and yeah~ small opening.   Oddly enough I really like solid gate BD positrons you find crappy~ for myself I prefer the solid gate over wire gates.

You can actually hear them snap shut which gives a minor psychological boost that they performing to spec. I've had Camp wires (both photons and nanos) that didn't properly close due to bent wires.    As for the Positrons~ sure they might weigh a bit more~ but they are durable.

If I expect bolts/pins on a route~ I'll often rack a couple quickdraws~ but yesterday I instantly regretted not clipping and extending an alpine draw on a pin when the ropedrag got bad... The wear on rope is really secondary~ I have two sizes of biners on my runners (alpine draws)~ and I put the smaller one on the gear side~ its a common practice. When I go into the actual alpine~ in order to save weight~ I dont take as many alpine draws as I would on a regular trad route thats close to my limit.,Jul 2009,Apr 2 2017,0

6311,new BD headlamp=piece of junk,1,16," Personally I'm not really impressed with any of the common outdoor gear manufacturer's headlamp offerings (at least in the < $200 range).  They are all expensive plastic crap.     almost all headlamps will drain batteries if left sitting for a while.  The reason is that they use integrated circuits to handle the button functions (as opposed to a physical on/off switch).  It'a called parasitic drain   My advice is that if you want a really durable and bright headlamp~ look at other product categories like police/military/tactical lights.  Personally~ I've been really happy with my Nitecore HC30.  It retails for somewhere around $70 but can be found as low as $50.  It's the brightest headlamp I've ever owned~ and also the most durable.  At full power it emits 1000 lumins!  Yet on the 2nd to lowest brightness (there's 5 brightness levels) it will run for 15 hours~ and is a bright as my petzl tikka was on it's highest setting.  the whole body of the light is aluminum and it's waterproof to 2M.  Although it normally suffers from parasitic drain (like all ""smart"" headlamps) I have found that if I slightly loosen the endcap it physically breaks the circuit and won't drain the battery at all.   Only drawback about it and other similar lights~ is that they are powered by uncommon 18650 batteries.  But~ on the other hand the 18650 battery is what makes it perform so well.   I find it puzzling that the outdoor gear manufacturers can't do a bit better in the headlamp department for as much as they charge.",Mar 2015,Jan 27 2017,0

The biggest disadvantage is that the run time at maximum brightness is 0.9 hours but I always carry a spare Eneloop or two. I prefer the models that run on a single AA battery as they're lighter~ cheaper~ and it's easier to recharge an AA battery with a portable solar charger than a model that uses a Li-ion.

6327,new BD headlamp=piece of junk,2,11," BD headlamps are junk~ and borderline dangerous.

6351,DMM Alpha Trad Review,1,0," Quick Version...   Alpha Trad is out and it is nice.  Is it the new ""King of Carabiners""?  Nope.  It has the usual quality and polish I expect from DMM but I don't think it improves on the WC Helium.   - The Clean Nose is wider than the Helium.  DMM didn't flatten the wire gate at the nose like the Helium so the Alpha Trad nose is slightly wider than the Helium's already wide nose.   - AT Wire Gate isn't as stiff as WCH.  I remember when the WCH came out that I thought it had a stiff gate.  I've since grown to love that stiffness.  The AT returns to a softer feeling gate that I don't like as much.   - AT Wire Gate bends are more asymmetrical.  What I mean is the two side are not ""in line"" or in the ""same plane"" for as much of the gate length.  This means that there is less of a flat feeling surface to push on.  The WCH does this better.  See pictures.  Hard to describe.   - Kinked Back.  This might be a really personal thing (like shoe fit) so take this one with grain of salt but~ I DO NOT like how the kinked back feels in my hand.  Its shape combined with the gate shape makes the AT feel like it's slipping up and out of my fingers.  Like I'm trying to grip a triangle a bit to far towards the narrow point. Look at the pictures.  The AT spine doesn't sit as parallel to the palm of my hand.  It seems to angle down and away from it making it feel less secure.  The WC spine sits flat against my palm.  It's hard to illustrate in pictures mind you.   I also have big hands so this might not be an issue for others.  The WCH just feels more stable to me.   EDIT: As I think about this more~ it may be that the spine of the AT is still pretty flat against my palm BUT~ changes the angle of the GATE in my fingers to be steeper... See last photo   - Gear Racking Biner.  Again~ the shape and gate kinks of the DMM AT make it more awkward to use this as a cam racking biner.  I face my gates out btw.  You end up having to cock your wrist more to grasp the biner and remove it from your harness.   So~ overall~ I'm sticking with Heliums (and Nitros) as my go-to biners for racking and bolt side clipping etc.  That said~ I DO THINK the AT will make a really nice ROPE SIDE biner on a QD.  Like a more polished version of the BD Livewire (Neon Green Wire Gate).  Note sure it's worth the nearly $5 difference with the Livewire though... WC Helium and DMM Alpha Trad (in Gunmetal).  Nearly the same size...  Nose Width Comparison.  WC is slightly thinner.  WC= 11.5mm DMM = 12mm  DMM AT Gate Kink is a bit Asymmetric.  Another angle of the DMM AT gate.  Helium Gate is flatter...

6353,DMM Alpha Trad Review,1,2, I've been using a few of these on the rope end of my long sport draws.   I own several of the alpha clip (solid gate variant) and was interested in seeing how the wire gates compared.   My personal view point - better for the rope end than heliums. I like the softness of the gate~ you can basically drop the rope into them. The depth of the basket ensures that the ease of the gate isn't an issue.   I strongly feel that they are the kings of wire gate biners. I love the gate action.    My only concern is that they are slightly smaller than I would prefer~ they don't fit in my hand as well as larger biners.,Jan 2011,May 25 2012,0

6357,DMM Alpha Trad Review,1,6," ""Spine seems like it wants to slide UP and out of my hand."" My comments:    Yah…I see what you’re saying with the kinked back and all. But your illustration is ‘biner sans gear. I’m wondering if’n a little weight holding that ‘biner down wouldn’t help counteract that slip-up-outta-the-hand feeling you’re describing. Sounds like an overly technical point~ perhaps. But I’m betting a chunky cam on there would make a difference. (I’ll letcha guys know as I’m planning on buying a couple of the light versions when they come out.)   ALSO: The picture~ where you’re critical of the Alpha’s grab-a-triangle-slide-upedness. You’re grabbing the ‘biner thumb against the spine. Which is cool~ all cool. But you yourself say you rack gate OUTwards. Which means you’ll actually be grabbing that ‘biner thumb on GATE~ not against the spine as you’re demonstrating.  (Unless you have triple jointed wrists…)   My point is that your criticism here might fail on the above two points. Used as pictured~ yah~ maybe the Alpha wouldn’t handle so well. But it seems as though you’re not testing this ‘biner in any real-world application sense. And maybe you have; maybe you’ve hung gear onnit and tried grabbing it thumb on gate. But your picture here could suggest otherwise.   Me~ myself~ I don’t much care for the Heliums~ and this specifically because of the pinched wire head you mention (pictured above.) I too rack gate outwards~ and trying to position my fat thumb on the wire gate usually (always?) sees the Helium rolling away~ leaving me fumbling and groping for gear.    That alpha offset gate looks…tricky. But like I say~ I’m gonna give a couple ‘biners a try and see how they perform for me. Full confession: I already own the solid gate Alpha quickdraws and can’t love a piece of gear any more.   Thoughts? Comments? Wails of grief?",Jan 2009,Jun 12 2012,0

It completely neglects the positive sides of Alpha Trad(shape~ grip on the back) and misleads on the arguments for WCH.

6360,DMM Alpha Trad Review,1,9, For what it's worth~ I agree with mattm's assessment in general~ and particularly about the awkward shape of the spine. It's just kinda awkward to hold.   I will hold back opinions on the gate comparison~ as I've noticed some stickiness of the gates on my older heliums (at least two of which that I remember I could have kept propped open before I lubed 'em). Maybe the alpha trads' gates are a little more robust. Who knows.   The alpha trad might be negligibly nicer for the rope end of quickdraws for some people that prefer the bent spine shape~ but we're talking REALLY small stuff here and more opinion than solid fact. The helium makes a substantially nicer racking and general use carabiner.   Frankly~ I would rather have the heliums any day. Like the spirits~ they have withstood the test of time~ are simple~ are practical~ work DAMN well~ and are the gold standard by which all new gear should be judged.   And before we sling claims of bias~ my regularly used 'biners are a mix of DMM~ WC (yes~ I use lots of heliums)~ Petzl~ BD~ and Metolius. If I were making a brand new rack and everything today and I could pick only one brand for some reason~ it would DEFINITELY be DMM~ but I doubt I'd grab more than a couple alpha trads~ maybe none at all. I CERTAINLY won't be picking any up since I already have the heliums. The alpha trad is just fancier than practical. The rope-end sport version~ however~ is dreamy. . .,Aug 2010,Aug 21 2012,0

6370,DMM Alpha Trad Review,1,19, FWIW I completely agree with OP's review.  What sealed the deal for me when comparing alpha trads to heliums was that the heliums have more basket space so you are less likely to get your finger caught if your finger goes into the carabiner while clipping.  If you open the gates~ the distance between the tip of the gate and the depth of the basket is shorter on the alpha trad.   Also~ the alpha trad is marginally heavier and it seems to flip around more frequently when used on the bolt side of draws for some reason (possibly due to the kinked spine shape).   By my experience~ wild country heliums are still easily the best wire gates... disappointing considering they were released more than 10 years ago!,Dec 2011,Aug 20 2014,0
6371,DMM Alpha Trad Review,1,20," Heh - Blast from the past.   Today~ I'd still lean WC Heliums with the caveat that I wish they'd update the narrow side to accommodate slightly wider webbing.  WC Heliums came out during the ""skinny webbing"" craze of 8-10mm stuff and it's evident that the narrow end.   Later biners like the DMM Spectre 2 address this a bit better.  Honestly~ if the Helium and Spectre 2 had a child~ it would likely be the perfect all round biner.   Curious to see the upcoming DMM Chimera - looks promising. DMM Chimera",Jun 2006,Aug 20 2014,0

6373,DMM Alpha Trad Review,2,1, First~ thanks for the great review Matt.

6375,DMM Alpha Trad Review,2,3, I have been using Alpha Trad Lights on alpine draws for a few months alongside my Helium draws.

6378,Grivel Clepsydra K10G belay karabiner,1,0," I'm not a technical reviewer~ just a regular climber who has been around for a while - but thought I'd post up a review as I haven't seen any for this biner~ and thought it might be useful for anyone considering getting one.    I picked up one of these to try out as my new belay karabiner. I've been using an Edelrid belay biner recently with a captive wiregate that goes around the belay loop on my harness~ and got to like that feature very much. I don't really have concerns about cross-loading when belaying from my harness~ but I do like the way the gate holds the karabiner in the correct orientation all the time - I find that there is less fuss when orienting the ATC correctly~ and I never feed the ropes upside down any more. So when I sold that biner (part of a set with a Megajul) I went looking for another biner with a captive loop~ and found this little work of art: Grivel Clypsedra K10G   Grivel's twin-gate technology is covered in a couple of reviews on MP~ but I haven't seen it in person~ and haven't seen this belay biner before. In the hand the biner oozes quality - a beautiful finish~ smooth action~ and clever design. The weight is kept down by I-beam construction for the most part~ but the working area is a nice wide-radius rounded shape~ with plenty of space for munter or clove hitches. The belay loop attachment area is squared off so that belay loops sit square and snug~ and the wire keeper gate holds it firmly in position. Not only does it stay in position~ but the nature of the keeper means that even when the gate is open (putting someone on/off belay) the biner is firmly attached and isn't going anywhere.    I wasn't specifically looking for a twin-gate~ but the advantages seemed obvious - if the gates are closed~ they are locked~ no need to check. How many times have I double & triple checked my screwgate~ sometimes nervously while my climber is on the verge of falling? I like the idea of never having to even consider it again.    So how is it in practice? ""Practise"" is the key word there.... Initially I found the twin gate awkward to use. The recommended way of opening is shown below: Grivel K10G open technique   The golden outer gate has a ridge on the side that protrudes beyond the black inner gate~ allowing you to use the side of your finger or thumb to open it. It took me a little while to realise that when clipping the karabiner onto the belay loop or keeper loop on the harness~ you don't need to open both gates - simply open the outer gate~ and push the biner into place~ the inner gate opens by itself. Then once it is on the belay loop~ simply pull it outwards and the wire keeper opens and closes around the belay loop - simples. It took me a bit longer to work out how to easily get the ATC loaded and unloaded without removing the wire keeper from the biner. And taking the biner off the harness and racking it on a belay loop was positively fiddly and took 2 hands initially. I found it annoying when gym climbing and frequently swapping from belay to lead & back~ and was concerned that on a multipitch~ I'd be more at risk of dropping my ATC.    But then I found Grivel's videos~ where the biner is demonstrated by Stevie Haston (the Clint Eastwood of the climbing world) who displayed gunslinger-slick moves in clipping~ unclipping and re-clipping the biner in every conceivable circumstance. I too would like to be as cool as Stevie Haston~ and spent some time in front of a mirror practicing my facial expressions (primarily a tiny~ wry smile~ as if to say yes~ I do find this a little embarrassing but the pay is good). I also practiced the moves~ and it has become much easier. Some actions are much quicker and easier than a regular screwgate~ where 1-handed operation would be very difficult. Other actions will take a bit of practise~ but I think after a few more sessions it will be second nature.    And I'm happy to put a little effort into changing my habits~ as I really like the biner itself~ and the little extra peace of mind in knowing that the gate is always secure. I tried all sorts of things to find a way to defeat the twin-gate~ but can think of no real-world circumstance where a rope can get out of the biner without deliberate intervention by the belayer.    Pro: a very nicely made biner~ very usable~ all regular features of a good belay biner in terms of strength~ good gate opening width~ nice rounded working surface - plus excellent shaped belay loop attachment point~ wire keeper gate for the belay loop~ and innovative twin gate security. You get to look like Stevie Haston.   Con: some effort involved to learn new techniques for clipping / unclipping.   Overall - I like it~ and appreciate the additional safety and usability. I wouldn't necessarily advocate going out and changing your current belay biner - but if you are in the market for a new one~ I'd give this a try~ I think the twin gate is fantastic in this application",Sep 2010,Mar 5 2017,2

Also I think black diamond has the best gear loops for trad climbing~ since they are flat and rigid which keep your gear from jamming up when your loops are loaded. Nothing more frustrating than trying to pull a cam out of the middle of a gear loop like a petzl or misty mountain harness when you pumped as the weight of the surrounding cams are causing them to slide back down into the middle of the loop.  As far as comfort on multi-pitch its fine~ and honestly no harness will keep you from getting rashes if you doing hanging belays all day anyways.

6425,quick review: Mad Rock Lifeguard,1,3, I've had the same experience with mine. Sweet size~ solid feel~ and gotta love the red color. However~ one thing that is not mentioned here that I believe should is an aspect of lowering with the lifeguard. I have found that it is half a new-user issue~ but the other half a usability issue. The lowering is completely functional and safe~ however when compared to the lowering ability of the grigri~ it falls a bit short. The grigri is undoubtedly smoother when lowering~ while the lifeguard is more stop-and-go. No matter the size/wear of the rope~ you have to work a bit harder to lower the climber at a consistent/comfortable rate. I have figured out the right brake hand tension and position~ but I still have the occasional moment where a few feet slide out a little faster then was intended.

6427,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Review,1,1," Thanks for writing the review~ it's nice to see comments from someone who has put some serious vertical miles under them wearing these.    I have questions:    With the ""right"" crampons~ do you feel they climb as well as your Baturas?    Regarding the crampon choice~ I understand Blade Runners are a novel design with a little more rigidity~ but the Cyborgs look like a pretty traditional semi-rigid crampon to me. I have Petzl Lynx - any reason to think they'd be different?   Thanks!",Sep 2013,Feb 21 2017,0
6428,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Review,1,2, Thanks for the review.     A more detailed performance comparison (flat footing~ kicking steps~ front pointing~ rock climbing~ etc.) with the Batura 2.0s would be helpful.,Aug 2013,Feb 21 2017,0

6430,Arcteryx Acrux AR Mountaineering Boots Review,1,4, Bill~ new boots already?   I decided to try on the Acrux vs Phantom Tech. If phantom tech fits you well~ I can't imagine Acrux will fit. Toe box is just way to small. So try them on in person.,Aug 2007,Feb 22 2017,0

6438,Scarpa Vapor V,1,2, good catch! Thanks!,May 2009,Apr 9 2015,0
6439,Scarpa Vapor V,1,3, in contrast to the review ive found the vapor to have a fairly WIDE toe box   enough so that i use them fairly interchangeably with other wide shoes such as the katana lave/velcro   IMO its basically a katana lace~ but with velcro ... and slightly less edging   ;),Mar 2009,Apr 9 2015,0
6440,Scarpa Vapor V,1,4, I like how low volume Scarpas are but I do find them uncomfortably narrow in the toe box compared to Sportiva shoes (Solution~ Miura VS for example). This is comparing size 40 in Sportiva to Vapor V 40.5-old orange ones~ Instinct VS 41~ Boostic 40.5). I actually sold Katana laces for being a little too narrow~ cramped~ and stiff in the toe box in my normal Sportiva size so I can see how they compare more similarly.   I know two climbing friends who wear the Solutions for aggressive climbing and Vapor V's for everything else. They are a good shoes and I think they are like a Muira VS with a better heel and more balanced and integrated construction between upper and sole. I handled the new version of these in REI and they felt really good and much improved. The only thing I cant get over~ and why I sold my Scarpas~ is the power/edging spot seems more in between the big/2nd toe in a dead space area. It feels unnatural compared to Sportiva for me. I think Scarpa would be more suited for the symmetrical foot shape with a longer 2nd toe.   Basically what all this meant for my climbing~ these Scarpa shoes were killer for overhung/roof climbing (best heel and snug technical fit) but felt sort of untrustworthy/sketch feeling on more vertical climbs were weighting the foot and heavy edging was involved . Also they were uncomfortable climbing vertical or slab since weighting the toes crushed them together too much.,Jan 2015,Apr 15 2015,0
6441,Scarpa Vapor V,1,5, Yeah~ I would also call the Vapor V a medium to wide toe box.  They fit me much better than either the Anasazi velcro or the Katana velcro.  Wider than sportiva for sure~ except for the solution.   These are my go to shoes these days and I cycle through a few pairs.  One thing I've noticed is the rubber that comes on them is not as good as Stealth.  For years I thought vibram XS whatever was just fine but having worked a few projects with two pairs of vapors~ one with vibrate and the other with stealth~ I was surprised at how much better I felt on crap feet with the stealth.     Also~ the factory rubber is really thin.  I think it's like a 3.2mm vs the 4mm I get the resole with.     Minor gripes.  I really like these shoes~ I consider my foot on the wide side~ and somewhat asymmetrical.  These things edge pretty well~ but for super edging power I have a pair of Magos in the same size.  I don't like the fit of the magos as much but in the forefoot where it counts they fit well and those things are stiff.  I also have some boostics in .5 euro size up which are comfy and good where you don't need to edge hard.     Slab?  Every shoe hurts on slab so far as I can tell. ,Nov 2006,Apr 15 2015,0

6443,Scarpa Vapor V,1,7, comparing size 40 in Sportiva to Vapor V 40.5-old orange ones~ Instinct VS 41~ Boostic 40.5).    The only thing I cant get over~ and why I sold my Scarpas~ is the power/edging spot seems more in between the big/2nd toe in a dead space area. It feels unnatural compared to Sportiva for me. I think Scarpa would be more suited for the symmetrical foot shape with a longer 2nd toe.     I've found that I need to size down much more for sportivas than scarpas.  42 in the orange vapors and 40.5 in the TC pros.  I have a broader shaped toe box~ 2nd toe is close to the same length as my big toe.  The 42 vapor gives some toe curl and is just tight enough to not have dead space~ but can be left on for a few pitches roped climbing at a time in gym.     I'm still breaking in TC pros right now~ but the 40.5 puts my big toe very snug at the end~ but doesn't cause toe curl.  I don't have any experience with sportivas down turned shoes though.   In regards to the sweet spot~ I find the most wear just to the inside of my big toe.  I do outside edge to flag frequently also.,Jan 2015,May 20 2015,0
6444,Scarpa Vapor V,1,8, The rubber on these seem extraordinarily harder. Hard to go back to my Evolvs that fit a little more comfortably... Something I'm willing to give up for that extra advantage.    I'm really interested in the 2015 line after that review. Looking for a second pair already!,Apr 2015,Jun 10 2015,0
6445,Scarpa Vapor V,1,9, I have owned quite a few pairs of Scarpas and these were my least favorite. I owned two pairs of Visions (the predecessor to this show) and a pair of Vision laceups.    The toe box on these is what I would call medium-snall. Wider than a Katana but for sure smaller than most of the Evolvs I have tried.   My biggest issue was the materials. The upper was a very soft material and got shredded bad from some foot jamming. My biggest complaint~ though~ was the velcro. The velcro stopped functioning compeltely after about 6 months of weekend warrior use. I would strap them on and without fail 10 feet up I would feel one strap pop off~ followed shortly by the other.    This all applies to the older model so take it with a small grain of salt. Perhaps someone else can chime in about durability on the newer model?,Sep 2010,Jul 6 2015,0
6446,Scarpa Vapor V,1,10, I've been getting the Velcro getting weak right at the end of life of the first resole.,Nov 2006,Jul 6 2015,0
6447,Scarpa Vapor V,1,11, Mine are fine so far ... Just sent a pair off for resole   Last years model   But i only use em for sport and face style trad .... Not footjamming   ;),Mar 2009,Jul 7 2015,0
6448,Scarpa Vapor V,1,12, Sorry to revive a dead thread~ but I wanted to write about the old 2014 model Scarpa Vapor V in women's blue (same model but blue of first pic).  When I was breaking them in~ I couldn't find much info that they would stretch~ so in case anyone else hoarding shoes / finds New old stock~ I just wanted this info out there.  Yes~ they do stretch~ probably 1/2 size.  But I tinkered with mine.   I wear a size 35 shoe (3-3.5 men's~ 4.5-5 womens) and got them in size 35.  I wear a size 33.5 in Miura VS.   At first~ they felt like they were cutting my Achilles tendon off.  So I cut that slingshot thing with a boxcutter so the lorica could stretch.  It was still too tight~ so I made a few more slits and peeled the rubber between the slits off.  It still felt tight for a while~ then after like 10 gym sessions suddenly I realized... they felt absolutely perfect.  Even though they are synthetic lorica~ they did stretch. People describe them as a Scarpa's answer to La Sportiva's Miura VS~ and I sort of agree.  The soles feel are a bit stiffer than my Miuras but still sensitive~ and feet grab onto small things without feeling insecure~ like some of my other shoes.  Feel very secure.   I have these with XS edge (later they were made with XS grip.... um I got those also).  Now that they are broken into the perfect amount~ they are amazing~ and I want to save them.     Time to break in another pair of shoes now.,Dec 2012,Feb 15 2017,0

6450,Scarpa Vapor V,1,14, You should try the vapor and the Anasazi velcros then~ see what fits better,Nov 2006,Feb 16 2017,0
6451,Scarpa Vapor V,1,15,,Jan 2014,Feb 16 2017,0
6452,Scarpa Vapor V,1,16," Y'all are getting the katanas and the katana laces mixed up. The velcros are a basic intro shoe while the laces are much better shoes and ever so slightly downturned. I've used the velcro katanas and I'm not a huge fan. I'll have to look into the anasazis.    ""I could only fit in the Katanas by sizing them too big (they're too narrow for me at the ""right"" length)""   I have the exact problem with the katana laces. They fit perfectly width wise but I've got about half an inch between my toe and the front point of the shoe. I have very wide feet with a mild morton's toe",May 2014,Feb 16 2017,0
6453,Scarpa Vapor V,1,17,,Dec 2012,Feb 16 2017,0
6454,Scarpa Vapor V,1,18," Katana lace and velcro are only similar in name. Katana velcro crushes my pinky toe~ rand puts way too much pressure on the achilles~ and the lower heel is stupidly baggy even sized tight.    The katana lace has a similar wide forefoot to the vapor~ perhaps more room for mortons toes. It will be a bit stiffer than the current vapor velcro as it has a full length sole. Katana lace can be sized well w/o knuckling your big toe~ I can't do that with the vapor.   I own the katana lace sized large enough that my big toe follows the down turn~ but is no ""knuckled"" as an all around shoe into the mid 11s. Sandstone slab~ steep sport edging~ granite trad~ and a few grade IV alpine routes. They do everything well~ but excel at only one thing. Thin hands and below jamming in granite. The toe profile is thin enough to slot in at flares~ the stiffer sole allows you to really torque them in there. Note my little toes are NOT pushed in tight with the size I use~ this lets sole deform more in jams. That of course means they aren't the best for outside edging on thinner holds~ I've been using skwamas when I need smaller outside edging power.",Jan 2015,Feb 17 2017,0
6455,Scarpa Vapor V,1,19, Beware with dubious claims that this shoe edges~ heel hooks~ etc better than the Miura VS or whatever other shoe. I have had my Vapor V's resoled twice because they became so comfortable~ but the heel has *always* been baggy~ and is the number one complaint I hear about them and Scarpas in general. Also~ they have a split sole design~ sacrificing edging power for flexibility for overhangs. That being said~ the toe on the Miura is objectively more aggressive. The Miura also is a one piece sole~ with a much more rigid~ narrow heel~ with actual Vibram rubber on it~ not whatever slick stuff Scarpa puts on the Vapor heel. The toe pad on top of the Vapor is nice~ but is out classed by nearly every other top-toe rubber I've tried~ excluding obviously those that don't have any~ a la Miura~ Anasazi~ etc. This is still my go to warm up shoe~ slab shoe~ and even wide feet crack for a pitch or so~ and I find myself wearing them for the first 15-20 problems or 3-4 leads in the gym before switching to the Miuras for a more technical~ aggressive shoe. Just my opinion~ but the heel is garbage~ and the toe does not stay aggressive for long~ but it is very comfortable.,Dec 2015,Feb 18 2017,0

6457,La sportiva testa rossa....,1,1, Used them at a la sportiva demo~ didnt think too much of them. The rubber on the upper aggravates my knuckle.    The testa rossa is supposed to conform more to your foot with the rounded edges but honestly I just felt odd and didn't notice too much. I did only wear them for about 30 mins.    Ended up trying the muira vs also and fell in love. Wore them for about an hour~ so much more comfortable while still being aggressive.,Aug 2015,Oct 6 2015,0

6472,adidas Outdoor Approach Shoes Initial Impressions ,1,1, I'm confused.  Didn't Adidas buy 5.10?  Why make their own brand shoes when they already have an established~ respected brand under their wing?  It looks like they're taking advantage of the sale to use Stealth rubber~ but it's weird that they would essentially try to compete with themselves.,Jul 2014,Oct 23 2016,0

6476,adidas Outdoor Approach Shoes Initial Impressions ,1,5, Right~ but the most important part of the shoe is proprietary 5.10~ so I guess I still don't get it.  For me~ Adidas is a very strongly negative brand association; they make running and soccer shoes and are a big corporation~ with absolutely zero street cred when it comes to climbing gear.  If I don't like 5.10~ I might look at Scarpa~ Evolv~ or La Sportiva approach shoes~ but I wouldn't look to see what Nike has to offer.,Jul 2014,Oct 23 2016,0

6480,adidas Outdoor Approach Shoes Initial Impressions ,1,9, I love Five.Ten and have supported them and sported their approach shoes since the 90's. One of my all time favorite shoe was the Five. Ten Access. It looked very similar the the Terrex Solo and Scope and would be very excited to give this shoe a try.  The shoe I had was got modified few different times with shoes that came out~ kinda similar~ one called the Ascent and maybe even a newer~ like since 2010 called the Access but resembled NOTHING of the original which was circa 2004 - 2006.  It was a hand sewn sole to the upper~ incredibly light~ by far and away thee lightest approach shoe ever made. Being that it had stealth rubber I eventually wore thru the soles and never got it fixed up. Since then I've only found one shoe that could compete and that was the La Sportiva Exum pro's~ also got discontinued~ and haven't been as pleased with any other approach shoe since. Salewa had me excited for awhile but ultimately disappointed too. To each their own though~ I've seen plenty of reviews where a lot of hate'n goes on towards 5.10~ due to QC~ durability issue or fit. Would love to see 5.10 continue in some form or another~ I think their Stealth rubber is the best. I had my Exum pro's resoled a couple of times~ with the 5.10 stealth rubber.,Apr 2009,Nov 20 2016,0

6494,Fusion Climbing Gear,1,0, Fusion Climbing Gear    About 3 months ago~ a rep from Fusion posted on the general message board that they had some new products coming out. A few people scolded them for spamming~ and a few more people critiqued their grammar. I decided ‘why not try getting some gear on the cheap?’ and offered to try out some of their products and let people know what I thought.  Fusion gear   Two months later I’ve got a few nice lockers~ nylon runners~ draws~ and a figure 8. So here’s what I thought:    Techno HMS locker:  Techno Locker    As a belay carabiner it worked great. There is a wide gate opening and the locking action is smooth. It weights 2.5 Oz and at $13 on their website~ it’s not a bad deal for a nice~ big~ locker. Essence Screw Gate:   essence screw gate     A really nice rigging carabiner. There isn’t anything too fancy about this carabiner~ but it has a nice shape for rigging anchors~ a good-sized gate opening and smooth action. Weight: 2.4 oz Price: $13 Tazo Auto Lock- Steel   Steel Auto Locker    I’ve never used these big steel auto-locking carabiners. This one is nice~ but the auto lock tends to snag while opening and closing. It’s rated at 35kn so I guess it would be useful if I were planning on hanging my jeep from a cliff… Techno Wave Quickdraw techno wave draw    I was really happy when I took these out to use them. With the exception of a few new BD hotwires~ my draws are a mismatch of everything. Having a new set of six was pretty nice. They have the thicker nylon dog bones~ a techno wire gate on one end~ and a techno strait gate on the other. Personally I like the nylon dog bone; some times it gives me that extra inch to hit a bolt from a better stance. The techno carabiners felt great in my hand~ had smooth gate action~ and weren’t too bulky. The wire gates clipped super easy~ and the rope ran through them perfectly.   clipping  climbing   The big deal with these draws is the price. If you wanted to have a full set of these~ split them with some one~ or just tons of inexpensive wire gates~ at set of 24 is only $180 shipped. That’s $7.50 per draw! Quickdraws Nylon Runners  runners    I also received a few nylon runners. They are similar in size to the thicker mammut runners but have a stiffer feel~ maybe because they are still on the newer side. These are great for slinging trees for anchors~ but not the best for trad draws. The people I dealt with at Fusion were very helpful~ and seemed excited to be getting into the climbing gear market. Aside from the weird names of their products and their mediocre website~ I think they are doing a great job. Their gear is solid and with a little bit of time~ they could be providing competitively priced gear to the rock climbing community. If you want some free gear too they are holding a Photo Contest. Top prize is  $800 worth of gear more info here:  Fusion Photo Contest,Feb 2010,May 25 2010,0
6495,Fusion Climbing Gear,1,1, The figure 8 did perform well. I had never used one before this~ so I can't really compare it to anything. They are a little nicer to rap with than an ATC~ but they don't serve much else of a purpose and aren't worth their weight. They are fun though~ and smooth for rappelling.    After using this gear I wouldn't call it the highest end stuff~ but I would call it safe~ functional~ and durable (it seems durable but time will tell).,Feb 2010,May 25 2010,0
6496,Fusion Climbing Gear,1,2," After seeing personally what BD goes through with their testing~ QA and certification~ I hesitate to purchase gear from a company that stamps ""UIAA Zoom"" on one carabiner of the quickdraw.    The extra $2 per biner that you spend on certified UIAA and CE gear is worth it.   That being said~ when fusion biners are certified~ assuming the design is good. I'll try them out. I have carabiners and gear from   BD   Metolius   Trango   Cypher   mammut   omega pacific   SMC   petzl    DMM   Madrock   and stubai   All these companies are UIAA and CE. Don't trust your life to saving a buck.   Also~ I am pretty sure that most any employee at any of these companies can spell the word "" rappel """,unknown,May 25 2010,0

6519,Fusion Climbing Gear,2,4," ""what the fuck is that?"" It's a ""Flybiner"" used in parasailing rigs.    Also used as connection point for chest to waist on full body harnesses for rescue~ and industrial applications. I use one on my Yates voyager instead of the delta or trapezoid screw link. They retail around $40. Fusion does have a great price but as a dealer I would have to commit to buying a minimum of like 100.    So far their gear seems good and at a better price. Which is good for outfitting groups and programs. I have used the concerto harness in climbing programs. It is fast easy to adjust especially for running a portable climbing tower where you have hundreds climbing in an afternoon. They retail at $58 with cobra type buckles and color coded webbing.    I keep hoping they will expand into more gear. They are also doing a line of tactical gear ~ especially lanyards and rigging belts.

6521,Petzl Nomics trainers?,1,1," I read a review of them last season (unfortunately can't remember where). Sounds like they're a cool idea and definitely give more of an ice climbing feel to training at the gym than other options like DryIce tools~ but IIRC the stealth rubber pads wear out super fast and aren't replaceable. Once the rubber's worn off they're unusable. I think the advice I read was wait until they offer some kind of ""resole"" solution.",Feb 2011,Jan 17 2017,0
6522,Petzl Nomics trainers?,1,2, They're a great idea in theory~ but the product right now leaves much to be desired. The rubber has already began peeling off of mine after a couple uses. Also~ and this goes without saying~ don't except anything near the same level of sensitivity you get with a pick. I'll say they're an improvement from the dry ice icicles though.,Jun 2015,Jan 17 2017,0
6523,Petzl Nomics trainers?,1,3, Thanks for the input. Was debating on these or the Dry Ice tools from FI~ If they wear out that fast there's no point,Sep 2014,Jan 18 2017,0
6524,Petzl Nomics trainers?,1,4, I have them for the BD tools and wrote a review last winter on MP. I think they're good. Mine was one of the original retail batches that has different rubber than the current model. As stated previously the rubber is soft and does peel back. To be fair once the rubber initially peels~ after just a few routes~ it really hasn't gotten much worse after 100+ or whatever in the last year.    Sensitivity is lacking for sure~ no hooking on dime edges~ the rubber will roll off~ which~ in a lot of ways is like real dry tooling. Teaching you to maintain tool positions throughout your movement and the inevitability that your tool can pop regardless.    They definitely train the right muscle groups since you're using them on your actual ice tools with similar movement/placement.    I can climb up to about 5.10a with them~ depending on the route. I occasionally have to cheat to get through a section of slopers or other impossible holds. However~ this also mimics real dry tooling movement: if you can climb a section using your hands and the tools make it more awkward~ climb it with your hands fool! Have you used the Dry Ice Tools? They're a terrible substitution. You can only climb routes with specific hold in specific orientations~ basically 5.4 jug hauls. They're lighter than real tool~ placement is nothing like real dry tooling. I don't see these as anything other than a novelty. To each their own.   Regardless~ if you're using in a gym~ check with management regarding their rules and regulations.,Apr 2010,Jan 18 2017,0
6525,Petzl Nomics trainers?,1,5, I've used the Dry Ice Tools~ I like them for what they are. But they are the tools I use on ice and the loop doesn't place like anything in the outdoors. and since they cost roughly the same as the Nomic trainers I figured they'd make more sense.,Sep 2014,Jan 18 2017,0

6551,Denali Boots,1,0, Does anyone have some guidance on boots to use on Denali?  I am climbing next May/June.  I have a pair of Spantiks~ but didn't really want to get an overboot and crampons on the overboot~ so was thinking about a boot with a built in overboot.  Thoughts on the best choices?  Thanks.,Sep 2016,Sep 23 2016,0
6552,Denali Boots,1,1, My friends and I had Koflach Arctis Expe boots for our attempt on the    West Rib in 2003.  We carried overboots~ but none of us ever used them.   Never got that cold.,Jul 2005,Sep 23 2016,0
6553,Denali Boots,1,2, If you're worried about using crampons with overboots then another alternative would be to use your Spantiks with insulated supergaiters instead of overboots. MountainTools sells them: mtntools.com/cat/techwear/G…. I used supergaiters on Denali and Mt Logan~ and they worked fine~ even though my feet tend to get cold easily. (On Logan I used supergaiters with Dynafit TLT6 ski boots~ which aren't as warm as Spantiks). As an insurance policy I slipped in a pair of chemical toe warmers on summit day.,Jul 2003,Sep 23 2016,0
6554,Denali Boots,1,3,,Jul 2007,Sep 23 2016,0
6555,Denali Boots,1,4, Totally doable with Spantiks and Purple Haze overboots.   I will tell you this~ I had Oly Mons and on summit day I thought my feet were going to fall off.    Millets~ Scarpa 8000 etc would be best,Mar 2015,Jan 12 2017,0
6556,Denali Boots,1,5, I find the greatest benefit of the -40 Overboots is wearing them around camp with some down booties. Constantly wearing climbing boots on a expedition is a good way get frostbite~ trench foot and blisters.    Spantiks and -40 Overboots get my vote.    Have fun up there on the Big-D:),Oct 2009,Jan 12 2017,0
6557,Denali Boots,1,6, i wore baruntses and wore the 40 below purple haze overboots. i only wore the overboots on summit day.   i wore my grivel g12 strap front~ auto rear (think they call it newmatic) over my overboots and it worked fine. they never fell off or came loose.   i would take my inner layer of my baruntses out of the shell layer~ then wear them with down booties around camp. another poster mentioned something similar.   this setup worked well for me.,Aug 2014,Jan 12 2017,0
6558,Denali Boots,1,7, Get over boots for the Spantiks. It isn't as though you will be climbing technical ice and mixed terrain and concerned about crampon performance.,Apr 2014,Jan 12 2017,0
6559,Denali Boots,1,8, It sounds like the OP doesn't want overboots.    G2 SM of Olympus Mons are really your only Sportiva choices.,Mar 2016,Jan 12 2017,0
6560,Denali Boots,1,9, There are a few considerations with this decision not already mentioned.   It's really helpful to not just look at your boots~ but your overall footwear system: (Socks~ liners~ boots~ overboots~ crampons~ and even your snowshoes)   Make sure everything is dialed and works together.   To simplify things and eliminate the need for the overboot and the pain in the ass of trying to fit crampons over them. Get triple boots. I saw plenty of people with Olympus Mons on Denali~ but I would also look into the Scarpa 8000~ as you might be able to get the previous model on the cheap.   These are great boots and I wore them my entire trip. A member of my team had the newer wrap around zippered Scarpa 8000 and he hated the design. The advantages of a triple boot are that you eliminate the overboot and get the gaitor~ so you can leave those two items at home. There was only a few times that a gaitor would be helpful though~ mostly when digging out camp after storms~ other than that~ you don't really need them for Denali in my opinion~ so that benefit is somewhat diluted. The 8000 and 6000 boots from Scarpa have the best lacing system in my opinion~ which makes a difference since you will be lacing up for weeks on end.   A lot of people that wear double boots and end up bringing overboots will wear them over their camp booties around camp~ which is really nice. If you get triple boots you're not going to also bring overboots just to wear with your camp booties~ some people will~ but I just wore an extra pair of socks to insulate and was fine on all but the coldest mornings. I have also heard of some people using their double boot liners inside of overboots~ but I never tried that due to fit issues (Again~ something to work out ahead of time).   The downside of the triple boot is that they are heavier and you might need to get extender bars for your crampons if you have bigger feet like I do. That adds extra weight on your feet as well.    If you go with a double boot plus overboots~ you will have to really dial in your fit with your crampons. Plastic over the toe instead of a metal bail will work a lot better in this regard and are generally preferred for this type of climbing anyways. I've climbed other times with the overboot and crampon combo and it worked ok~ although I did drop a crampon at one point~ which was surprising and uncool. You'll need to dial in fit with and without the overboot~ since you'll need to adjust the crampons before putting them on.    If I were to do it again~ I would still go triple boot. The only time they sucked was down low on the glacier a couple days when it was really cooking. Even unzipping them didn't help. They barely fit my snow shoe binding~ but overall they worked great given the varying conditions etc. on the mountain.   Also~ get some travel sized anti-perspirant and use it on your feet morning and night and your liners and socks will stay dry and your feet warm~ regardless of which boot system you choose.,Nov 2015,Jan 13 2017,0
6561,Denali Boots,1,10, I used Scarpa Invernos~ with OR overboots~ on an attempt 7 years ago. Plan on returning in 2-3 years and will use La Sportiva Spantiks for that attempt,Mar 2016,Jan 15 2017,0
6562,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,0," The Jul 2 has been on the shelves at Earth Treks for a few weeks now so I picked one up.  Not for any particular reason~ other than ""I like shiny things"".  I used it to belay my partner on 1 top-rope climb and 4 lead climbs.  I used it exclusively with an Edelrid Strike FG belay biner~ since I happen to have one and I figured that would be Edelrid's recommended pairing.   For perspective~ I usually use an old style GriGri for both TR and lead belay~ but I have also used various ATC-type devices~ the Mega Jul~ and the Mammut Smart.  I kinda collect belay devices so I switch it up fairly often.   It feels quite heavy~ though on paper it's only 20-some grams heavier than the Mega Jul.  Still plenty lighter than a GriGri or any other mechanical device.  It's stainless steel so it should last basically forever.   In TR the Jul 2 worked just like the Mega Jul~ but easier~ in two senses.  Firstly it handles the fat~ fuzzy~ semi-static TR ropes that Earth Treks uses better than the Mega Jul does.  The Mega Jul is rated up to 10.5mm~ while the Jul 2 is rated up to 11mm~ so this isn't a big surprise~ even though ET claims these ropes are 10.1mm.  Secondly~ it locks off even quicker than the Mega Jul does~ allowing no detectable rope slippage~ but unlocks easier when you want it to.  Lowering I don't really want to comment on because the rope/anchor we were at was fantastically stiff.   Lead belay with the Sterling 10.1mm gym rope that ET uses is where the Jul 2 really shined.  With your brake hand thumb in the loop~ paying out rope is near effortless.  Better than a GriGri with the cam held down~ equal to most ATC-type devices~ and much better than the Mega Jul.  Lowering~ on the other hand~ is difficult to control without gloves.  Don't bother using the thumb-in-loop method to unlock for lowering~ as your partner will start plummeting and become very cross with you.  Even using the ""gently rotate the device"" method~ it's still quite hard to find that balanced speed where the climber is coming down at a reasonable~ smooth pace.  Rather it tends to flip between ""too slow AND jerky to boot"" and ""incinerating your brake hand"".  I expect it would do a bit better with even thicker ropes~ on routes with more rope drag~ or with gloves.   I did not have the opportunity to catch a lead fall with it tonight.   I'd say my preliminary judgment is~ if you like the Mega Jul but find it overly tight with thick gym ropes~ the Jul 2 is a good supplement.  If you want a single-rope locking device and can't justify the cost of a GriGri~ maybe the Jul 2 (or the Mammut Smart~ same price) is for you.  For my part I'll probably play around with it for the next couple weeks until the Mad Rock Lifeguard comes out.",Jul 2015,Nov 15 2015,0
6563,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,1," Thanks for the comments~ I'm gonna grab one.  I've been ""testing"" the Mega in the gym~ I like it in that context for both TR and lead belay.  Except for the difficultly in handling superfat/fuzzy TR ropes~ so maybe I'm the ""right"" user for this.   I'm curious what biners everybody else is using.  I currently have it (Mega) on a BD Gridlock.  Mainly because I don't feel that biner is worthy of being used outside (so annoying to handle!).  The Mega wanders around and twists too much for my taste~ partially because the Mega isn't symmetrically loaded when you belay a single rope.",Apr 2012,Nov 17 2015,0
6564,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,2,,Jul 2012,Nov 17 2015,0
6565,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,3, The Mega Jul is very sensitive to the cross-sectional shape of the biner it's paired with~ so it's worth trying everything you've got to find your sweet spot.  My wife uses hers with a BD Rocklock which doesn't lock it up exactly 100% but lets it unlock easier.  Ditto the DMM Rhino which is my preferred belay biner.  I tried it for one night with a DMM Sentinel and that's just about the opposite: locks up like a vault~ doesn't want to let go.  The Edelrid Strike is in the middle.  I have a BD Gridlock but haven't tried it yet.,Jul 2015,Nov 17 2015,0
6566,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,4, I have a DMM Rhino on my GriGri~ I'll give it a try next time.  And maybe sell my GriGri.    :),Apr 2012,Nov 18 2015,0
6567,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,5, WOW~ my Jul2 arrived~ this thing is a heavy hunk of steel.  Pretty much totally unlike the MegaJul in terms of build (except that it is steel).  Perfect for the gym~ maybe just bought the last gym belay device of my life.  Makes me want to get that Bruce Steel biner now.  Ha ha,Apr 2012,Nov 28 2015,0
6568,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,6, Lead belaying with the Jul2 is amazing as well.  Because of it's larger slot design~ it feeds well~ feeling much like using an BD ATC.  I didn't have to catch any falls~ but have no doubt it'll lockup well.   I've also gotten used to lowering with it - a true pleasure even on the fat gym ropes (Movement).  The larger~ fatter lever of the Jul2 vs MegaJul make it pretty easy to control.   The only time when it gets rough is if there are lumps in the rope.  I seem to suck at lowering with a GriGri because my Jul2 lowers are so much better~ I should win an award.   I leave my GriGri in my gym bag~ but don't really plan on using it again.  I don't plan on using Jul2 outside the gym because belay devices which you can't double rope rap on annoy me.

6569,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,7, I recently picked up the jul 2~ have used it a bit in the gym~ a couple days trad~ and quite a few sport climbing. Caught around 20 lead falls on it with a few ropes. I think it's a great brake ASSIST device for mid to fat ropes. If you want to stick with your tube device technique it's worth trying.    I have used a mega jul for the past year~ for trad/alpine where rope movement tends to be slow it works well enough. For lead belaying sport with faster high clips I found it had too much drag and I couldn't pay out rope fast enough~ I found myself slightly shorting leaders on unexpected high clips (a problem I don't have with an ATC). Gym ropes the mega jul flat out sucks.   Paired with the strike biner I've used the jul 2 with:   10.2 gym rope. Pays out nicely~ even with the older stiffer ropes~ still some resistance. Easy to take in slack. Easy to unlock. Locks off fully and fast.    9.8 edelrid boa/9.8 mammut. Pays out easily~ with a thumb on the lever you can throw out arm lengths of slack with about as much effort as a gri gri. It locks off well~ but this is no gri gri. After a soft catch while hanging I tried relaxing my grip on the rope~ if I nudged the brake strand ever so slightly it would creep through the device. It's imperative that you treat this like a tube device~ it cuts effort required to catch a fall to nothing with a 170lb leader~ but for higher force falls or heavier climbers this may not fully lock off.   9.5 mammut. Pays out slack with zero effort. Would allow a climber to creep in locked of position ever so slightly. I think that holding the brake strand firmly with a slight bit of slack before the thumb loop of the device could let you make soft catches with no need for jumping.,Jan 2015,Aug 16 2016,1
6570,quick review: Edelrid Jul 2,2,8, This post is a combination of some of my other posts about my Jul2 experiences. I'm a big fan of Edelrid Jul 2 for sport lead belaying. I've seen two indoor full on (50ft) decks in the last year. Fortunately both climbers were okay. One with a GriGri and one with an ATC.    This is my take on sport belay devices.  ATC: No passive locking. In an ideal world~ this would be sufficient but we've all seen situations where the belayer has let go of the brake hand due to poor technique~ slammed against the wall~ etc. GriGri: All motions are downward and can lead to confusion.    1. Holding the cam down for slack.    2. Pulling down with the lever for lowering.    3. Pulling the brake hand down to catching a fall.  Passive locker (Jul~ Mammut Smart~ etc): Simple like the ATC but with passive locking.    Push up for slack    Pull down for catch.   Can feed out slack without removing braking hand from device.The Jul2 isn't great when lowering on beat up gym top ropes~ I still use an ATC for that. For multi-pitch belaying where FF2 can occur~ please read  the-deadly-atc thread. Its a long read but has lots of good information about the limitations of belay devices.   I did have some issues with rope wear. After six months of climbing indoors 2 or 3 times a week on lead using 50M Metolius Monster 10.2mm Gym Rope~ BD GridLock and a Jul 2. I noticed the middle of the rope was getting fuzzed while the outer ends were looking good. The right is from the middle of the rope where the device contacts the rope when lowering the leader from the top.   Rope wear   My theory is the Jul2 steel body wears the top of the carabiner. The gridlock is very squarish and when lowering~ the rope runs across the scratched portions of the biner.   Jul2 in gridlock   It only wears into the top of the biner when there's little friction between the belayer and the climber. I contacted Edelrid and they recommended using HMS Strike FG or HMS Bruce Steel. Since~ switching~ the fuzzing seems to have not gotten worse. The top is narrower than the bottom on their HMS biners~ which I think prevents the rope from running against the scratched portions.    These aren't my pictures but you can see how the Jul2 and the rope rests against the top edge.,Sep 2016,Jan 12 2017,2

6574,Totem Basic Cams are HERE,1,0," UPS dropped off some new toys yesterday.  This is an initial review as I haven't had time to climb on them yet.  Frankly~ based on my initial impressions~ you won't need a ""real rock"" review since they're so close to the old CCH Aliens in everything but sizing (see below) that I'd say if you've placed the old CCH ones these will work just the same.   So the first of the ""New"" aliens are out.  Totem calls theirs the ""Basic Cam"" and makes 5 sizes: Green~ Green/Yellow Hybrid~ Yellow~ Yellow/Red Hybrid and Red.    The New Totem Basic Cams   I'll cut to the chase: If you want new~ CE tested quality Aliens RIGHT NOW~ these are it.  Totem makes QUALITY products and their Totem Cams are gaining popularity for their innovative design and functioning (I love mine).  Totem Basics are essentially CCH Aliens v2.  They're nearly SPOT ON reproductions of the original.  Their action feels the same (if not a bit smoother)~ the flexibility is the same etc etc.  You want Aliens~ these are shipping NOW.  $60 shipped for a single or $54 each if you get a whole set (10% off a set).  This is a STEAL as this is the same pricing that I recall way back in 2002 when I got my first aliens.  Add to that the fact that they're QUALITY CAMS and this seems like a no-brainer.   OK~ so what's new and / or different?  There ARE changes to the Basics Cams so I'll try and cover them as best I can.   First~ at the cam/head end: The cam lobes have had their ""teeth"" rounded over on the edges.  I like this a lot as this is pretty much what would happen to the old CCH ones after some use anyway.  Just a more finished product IMO.  The Trigger wires are now wires terminated with little ""crimped balls"".  This is different than the most recent CCH stuff that used solid wire.  More like older CCH circa 2004.  Totem does put a ""Crimped Ball"" on the upper trigger bar to prevent the hated ""cam tipping"" you'd see in old CCH stuff.  Nice.  Lastly~ Totem uses a slightly different axel termination method (Peened I believe vs the old nut and threaded bar)  This actually makes he head width SLIGHTLY smaller on the new Totems.  Again~ nice. Totem Basic Cam: Head  Note the crimped ball to block cam tipping.   Moving down~ Totem uses a woven sheath like the last of the CCH designs.  I like this more than the old wire mesh as I think it made them slightly more flexible.  Totem addresses durability concerns by adding a SECOND sheath over the first that is free to rotate.  Simple and probably effective.  Time will tell but I like it so far.  Totem Basic Cam double trigger sheath.   Finally~ the thumb loop area:  Totem uses a slightly larger swage at the loop.  The colored tubing is also translucent vs the old CCH opaque coloring.  The Totem Offset sizing DON'T have the bi-coloring that the old CCH ones did.  Instead~ Totem makes the tubing the smaller color size and the web loop the larger color ala the Metoilus Offset Master Cams.  The Totem tubing also seems thicker/beefier than the old CCH.  I like this as it gives the thumb loop a bit more resistance to elongation and thus keeps the strength a bit higher (See BDs QC blog for info on thumb loop wires compressing and cutting the webbing HERE )   All in all~ a really nice re-issue of the loved design.   There ARE however some differences.  Namely~ the sizing of the cams is SLIGHTLY different than the original CCH ones.  A Red Totem Basic is NOT the same as an old Red CCH.   With my calipers the Old CCH Red = 1.3in MAX                             the new Totem    = 1.25in MAX   Slightly SMALLER.   The Yellow Totem is slightly smaller than the old CCH Yellow   The Green Totem is also slightly smaller than the old CCH Green.   Mikel (Totem Engineer) confirmed the slight size tweaking with me via email back when they first came out.  The sizing adjustment was done to avoid the sizing gap in the original CCH range that required the Grey 7/8in size to be introduced.  Comparing the NEW Totem red to the OLD Red and Gray CCH~ I'd say the Totem Red is closer to the old CCH grey in size.  L to R: CCH 7/8 Gray~ Totem Basic .95 Red~ CCH 1 Red   So this sizing difference MAY be a deal breaker for some.  I doubt it will be for me since I always liked the wider .5 BD in the Red CCH range (and now have a Purple Totem for narrow placements in the range).  This is the BIG difference of course.     Regarding sizes~ I don't mind that Totem doesn't have a blue or smaller cam.  I think the Metolius Master Cams are the better choice in that range (Blue and Purple Master Cams) since the head width is smaller than the old style CCH ones used to be and the cams are the harder 7075 reducing lobe deformations issues the smallest aliens suffered from.  Top to Bottom:  Blue Metolius Master Cam Green Totem Basic Cam Blue/Green CCH Hybrid (to show width of a Blue CCH that I don't have any more)   So I'm stoked that I have a reliable Alien again.  It's a more polished design with changes that I like.  The one hitch for some MIGHT be sizing changes but I doubt that will bother most people.  If so Fixe has their Carbon Copy on the way (at some point).  Bottom line is we now have AT LEAST one reputable manufacturer making the Alien again and you can get it NOW.  Sweet.

6575,Totem Basic Cams are HERE,1,1, Thanks Matt.  Great description.  From your pictures~ it looks like the new Aliens have been done very well.  I like the ball to keep the cams from tipping... I have had to make my own sort of modification to keep the old Aliens from getting off center.   I'm interested in the size difference.  It sounds like they just refined the line a bit to get rid of the grey~ but in my experience you don't really need the grey with the old Aliens~ at least not when free climbing.   There has been exactly one time in my life that I really needed a grey Alien~ but I hardly ever notice not having one.  If you look at BD sizes~ the .4 is almost exactly the same as a yellow Alien while the .5 is nearly identical to a red.  No one is asking for a .45 C4 now are they?   Get out and climb some finger cracks and let us know if you notice the difference!,May 2009,Oct 11 2011,0

6582,Totem Basic Cams are HERE,1,8," The Truth~ the whole truth and nothing but the truth.   ""lack in consistency in CCH's manufacturing quality and that they were over stating the strengths of their cams""   ""CCH screwed the pooch with how they handled the situation and the failures certainly put a bright spotlight onto the LACK of any QC and 3 Sigma manufacturing at CCH. That was ultimately what caused me to loose faith in my Aliens.""   That is pretty damning.  People got seriously hurt.  QC issues can KILL people in climbing.  Add to that that CCH NEVER responded to the issues publicly.  Did CCH change anything at all when shit hit the fan??  Some lame ""pull test"" so they could just throw the failures away~ cover up and move on. ""This is all water under the bridge of course since Totem now has QUALITY cams out that are CE tested and rated.""   I bet FEW people even know what the UIAA/CE ratings are.  You can't just google it and read.  You have to pay $$$ for them to send it to you.   I bet that most people would be shocked at how low the UIAA/CE rating is. ",Mar 2011,Oct 11 2011,0

6600,Totem Basic Cams are HERE,2,5, It is so funny to see people compare cams by just a glance at the heads.  Especially when trying to compare Black Diamond C4s to others.  BD C4 have a double axle.   The Purple BD and the Red Totem Basic have almost the same range.   Black Diamond C4 - .5 (Purple) = 19mm to 33mm   Totem Basic .95 (RED) = 19mm to 31mm   So really~ they are the same size cam.  Cause who uses a cam in the up 25% of the range.,Mar 2011,Oct 13 2011,0
6601,Totem Basic Cams are HERE,2,6, I've found visually comparing them helps a bunch. From the picture I can see that the Totem Red will fit in a more shallow slot than the purple C4.    And yes~ the Totem Red is slightly smaller than the C4 -- 2mm~ that is. And yes~ even if you only use both cams no more than 75% extended~ the purple C4 will hold slightly better in a crack at the higher end of its range compared to the Totem Red because it is slightly bigger.    A visual comparison is a good indicator of where you might have overlaps or holes in your rack.   Another person might have filled out this same gap b/w the purple C4 and the yellow C3 with the 0.4 and 0.3 C4. I chose the Totem Basic cams because I think they'll give me more placement options (like piton scars).,Aug 2011,Oct 13 2011,0

6614,Totem Basic Cams are HERE,2,19, Has anyone else had trouble with the trigger cables severing themselves on Totem Basics?   The first time this happened~ I blamed the placement~ since the cam's stem was forced to bend sharply over an edge when I fell on it~ and there was a coarse grain/pepple there.  This was the blue Totem Basic in the photos below.  It failed.  I'm not sure if I'd ever fallen on it before or not.   The second time is with the green one~ again shown below.  This time~ there wasn't any way the trigger cable could've contacted the rock while being loaded.  In this case~ the other two lobes of the cam held.  I'm not sure if I'd ever fallen on this one before either~ but I don't think I had.  So~ 2 out of 2 of my Totem Basics have ripped their trigger cables apart when falling on them~ and one was clearly not placed in a manner that should've put the cables at risk.   If you look closely~ it appears the cables on both cams were severed where the little bead is.  Perhaps this is a weak point.  Perhaps the cables are a bit too short when the cam lobes deform a bit under load?     Be it noted that I've taken dozens of falls on Wild Country Zeros of similar size~ and never had one fail.  While I realize my experiences are merely anecdotal~ I suspect there is a weakness with the trigger cables on the Totem Basics.  Totem Basic with severed trigger-cable  Another severed trigger cable.

6632,Vapor vs Vapor V,1,2, In the store the last felt completely the same. I imagine that the lace will be a much better edging platform once broken in with the full length sole. I can't say for sure though~ ended up just getting another pair of Katana Laces on sale instead.,Jan 2015,Dec 5 2016,0
6633,Vapor vs Vapor V,1,3, Despite the photos~ I think that the lace version is less stiff and less downturned (or certainly will not remain as downturned) compared to the velcro version. If sized correctly~ I think the lace version is a good thin-crack shoe~ similar to the Katana lace. These both feel like they have smaller/more secure heels than most SCARPA shoes.    I've got small heels~ but big toes and high-volume feet~ and I don't get as good of a fit on either of the updated Vapors as I did on the original orange model.    I think that by far the best technical edging/toeing shoe that SCARPA (or anyone) makes~ is the Boostic.,Dec 2006,Dec 6 2016,0

6637,Down Booties and hats,1,1, I've loved my western mountaineering boots.  Stay surprisingly dry in wet spring snow and so nice in camp after days in wet boots. For trips I'm not concerned about weight I use the north face thermoball because of the significantly more durable sole and better traction.    If your looking for more specialized items check out goosefeetgear.    They make great hear exactly how you want it.  Enlightened equipment is great too and I've been very happy with their gear.  I've had the OR down beanie and it's nice but it's a pain to wash (relatively speaking). It is definitely warmer than wool or any synthetic beanie I've ever used.,Nov 2007,Nov 1 2016,0
6638,Down Booties and hats,1,2, Enlightened Equipment is great and I love their gear but the wife and I went with the feathered friend booties because of the outer shell and its usefulness for walking around outside.

6642,Liquid chalks compared,1,0, I love liquid chalk.    I like having a nice base layer on my palms.   I like that I can use a little bit less of my high priced powdered chalk.   So I recently tried a bunch of different brands. I'll describe the differences below.   First~ let me point out that you can make your own liquid chalk. And save some money doing so.    Basically~ just add isopropyl alcohol to powdered chalk and mix well. 2:1 chalk to alcohol ratio~ 70% isopropyl seem to be most often recommended.   I liked this site~ although he/she was experimenting unsuccessfully with food grade Magnesium. imgur.com/gallery/6b8LS   I found four types.   Alcohol based~ Magnesium chalk~ liquid consistency-   I think these are all the same~ just different bottles. Brands include Edelweiss~ Mammut and Petzl.   Advantages- alcohol dries your hands~ dries quickly~ nice big bottles.   Cons-  alcohol dries your hands~ thin layer that wears off relatively quickly.   If you like this style~ go for the best price amongst them.  Liquid chalks Another liquid chalk Alcohol based~ Magnesium chalk~ cream consistency-   As far as I can tell~ So Ill liquid chalk is the only commercially available form of this type.   It's my favorite.   Advantages- alcohol dries your hands~ dries quickly~ nice thick layer of chalk which lasts longer.   Cons-  alcohol dries your hands~ comes in a small tube so may end up more expensive in the long run. Thick chalk   Alcohol based~ Silicon dioxide (silica) based~ not magnesium~ cream consistency-   Actually meant for tennis~ I believe. It has a slightly different feel~ but seemed to work pretty well.   Advantages- alcohol dries your hands~ dries quickly.   Cons-  alcohol dries your hands~ thin layer that wears off relatively quickly~ comes in a small bottle so may end up more expensive in the long run. The dispenser is not that easy to use as the cap pulls up then you shake out the cream. Tennis anyone?   Finally~ NOT alcohol based~ Silicon dioxide (silica) based~ not magnesium~ cream consistency-   The only example I found was the Camp version.    It's the only liquid chalk I disliked~ but it might be perfect for someone with dry skin who cannot tolerate all the alcohol.   Advantages- no alcohol~ has a slightly different feel~ but seemed to work ok.   Cons-  dries very slowly~ thin layer that wears off relatively quickly~ tends to settle in the bottle so takes vigorous shaking prior to use. Comes in a small bottle so may end up more expensive in the long run. Might be hard to get all of the product out given the bottle design. For teetotalers   Would be happy to hear about more options.   Simond has a version~ which I tried once~ IIRC it resembles the So Ill variety. May not be available in the US though.,Nov 2007,Jul 24 2016,0

6644,Liquid chalks compared,1,2, I made a bottle of liquid chalk that worked just as good if not better than any liquid chalk I tried from a brand name. Cost me about $3 to buy a bottle of 91% rubbing alcohol and sift some of my chalk thru a strainer to make it fine. Mix till im happy with consistency and then doneski. Not sure why ppl would spend so much on liquid chalk from mammut or others. I don't even find it works any better than regular chalk anyway. makes a nice base for a little bit till my hands get sweaty trying to make sketchy moves on 5.5 slab walls (;   J/K im totally crushing at least a 5.6   But really.

Before a route~ I'd grab a bit of chalk from my chalkbag and mash it up in my palm. Then just squirt some rubbing alcohol onto the chalk in you palm~ and rub your hands together to mix it together and rub it in.

6661,Question about down coats,1,0, I understand the difference between down that 800 fill power and 500 fill power.  The higher number is lighter and fluffier.   Here is what I don't understand doesn't it also matter how much down is in the coat?  Not just quality but quantity must matter as well.  I ask because I have a 650 fill lands end coat and a 700 fill marmot guide hoodie.  To the hand the 650 is clearly thicker and firmer.  I can tell you that it is a furnace on the coldest days.  It seems to have much more down in the coat.  Each baffle is stuffed.   How can I consider this when considering a new coat?  Something more specific that feeling the difference by hand?  Any thoughts are appreciated,Dec 2014,Oct 21 2016,0
6662,Question about down coats,1,1," Fill weight is what you're talking about.  Different jackets will vary significantly in their fill weight.  Some companies are good about posting both the quality of down (Fill POWER) and the amount in it (Fill weight).  Good luck finding that with many though.   Backpacking Light does a fair amount of digging to find fill weights so try there if you're looking at a specific item.  There's ROUGH indications of fill weight based on the naming conventions - Sweater = Very Light~ Jacket = Medium~ Parka = Heavy.   It's tough though because unless you feel them as you note~ you won't have a great idea of what's in it.   One thing I consider is the FP may not be all it's cracked up to be.  800FP is all the rage these days but I've noticed that several 650FP jackets ""seem"" warmer to me given a similar weight.  IMO~ the 650 is both more durable and seems to hold it's loft a bit better under the pressure a jacket gets in use.  The 800FP might be great in a lab but more and more~ the 650FP or the hybrids from Primaloft seem ""stronger"" and thus warmer.",Jun 2006,Oct 21 2016,0
6663,Question about down coats,1,2," Some companies put out how much they put in there~ some don't. Most people don't worry or care about it so there is no huge push to quantify it. Also even overstuffing a jacket with down can make it not as good as another with the same or worse ""fill power"" down. Mostly compare across categories ie layering piece to layering piece~ belay to belay.    But it does get tricky when you're trying to say compare a TNF L3 down jacket to a Patagonia Down Sweater Hoodie since they are both in the same category of jacket (layering down piece)~ both have 800 fill power~ and are practically the same weight.    At the end of the day  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",Oct 2011,Oct 21 2016,0
6664,Question about down coats,1,3," Down fill refers to how much space an ounce of that particular down will take up. 1 ounce of 800 fill down will take up more space than 1 ounce of 600 fill down~ providing better~ lighter insulation.   When it comes to the overall weight of the jacket - that doesn't matter. A jacket can have heavier face fabrics and liners~ more features~ heavier zippers etc. but that doesn't mean it's going to be warmer.   What you want to look at is the fill power (higher numbers = more loft~ more warmth:weight) as well as the amount of down that's used. For example~ 10 ounces of 800 fill down is going to be much warmer and more lofty than 10 ounces of 600 fill down. BUT~ if a jacket has 20 ounces of 600 fill and only 10 ounces of 800 fill~ you may have a different situation.   It all depends. It's going to vary. Like someone said~ some manufacturers will post the weight of the fill~ others wont. If you want mega warm~ go for something like a Patagonia Fitz Roy or maybe even an Outdoor Research Floodlight. Otherwise~ most of the other ""standard"" down jackets are going to give you the same basic performance.",Jul 2015,Oct 21 2016,0
6665,Question about down coats,1,4, When considering your new coat~ the first thing you need to ask your self is what do you want to use the coat for.   If you want a light-wight insulating layer for cool weather~ then those ultralight super loft jackets will work well.   Once temps drop below freezing you will probably need a more substantial jacket~ especially during periods where you are inactive~ like belaying. This is where you are correct~ the fill rating does not equate warmth.   What the industry really needs is a measured R-value like they have created for sleeping pads. For the most part~ if you look at the pads~ the thicker the pad the better the R-value~ regardless of what it is filled with. This is the same with jackets~ the thicker the baffle~ the warmer it will be. There is no good measurement for this on most speck sheets~ but weight is a fairly good indicator. Most jackets I look at are made with a similar lightweight nylon or polyester fabric~ so the difference in wight can be a good indicator to how much down is being used for insulation.   Also be careful not to get a jacket that is too warm. I over did it when I bought my last jacket~ and it is almost unusable until temps drop to close to 0F.,Jun 2014,Oct 21 2016,0
6666,Question about down coats,1,5, I also have long suspected that a heavy fill of~ say~ 650 FP down can handle more moisture before collapsing than the equivalent loft (and therefore fewer ounces) of 800 or 900 FP down.  Can't prove it though.  This is more of a concern when you're tent-bound for a few winter days and body moisture is building up in your bag.,Jul 2009,Oct 21 2016,0
6667,Question about down coats,1,6, As others have mentioned~ it's the amount of down combined with the FP that contributes to warmth.   The warmth is pretty closely correlated with loft and not fill power. Most companies these days make high fill power (800/850/900) jackets. What they fail to mention is that the jacket is paper thin and doesn't do anything when it comes to insulating.   The concept of insulating can be simplified to something~ well~ pretty simple. The thicker the layer~ the more air it traps thus keeping you warmer. This is true of almost all materials .   For whatever reason~ manufacturers don't seem capable of displaying the most simple way of determining warmth - inches of loft. Lay a garment flat~ and see how fluffy/thick it is with a ruler. It's mind numbingly simple yet almost no one does this. So you end up talking to some idiot customer service rep who says well our jacket is 950 and we use 60g/m^2 of insulation. Well whoopty f***ing doo~ I'm still going to be freezing if you only put .2 oz of 950 fp down in my coat. Now you're left trying to calculate how many ounces of down is actually stuffed into the stupid coat (good luck with that one)~ so you have to buy and send back 5 coats before you can find one that's half way decent because your local stores only stock TNF.   If you need something warm then you want high loft. FP is just going to determine how much that high loft jacket will weigh. If you really want to see how loft correlates to temperature~ look at custom sleeping bags sites.,Aug 2016,Oct 21 2016,0

6670,Question about down coats,1,9," Sonething that seems to be missing from these replys:   Loft isn't determined by the down. It's determined by the jackets construction. You then fill the jacket with the amount of down needed to meet that loft.   There's also a thing called overstuff~ which more down than is technically required is put in the same space. This can vary by manufacturer and product. Overstuff is MUCH less effective at increasing warmth than loft~ but is often needed to ensure the garment lofts correctly all the time.   From the OP: a lower fill power will feel ""thicker""~ and resist compression. The benefit of high FP is weight and compressibility. If you don't need that~ why spend the money on the higher FP? From a warmth stand point equal LOFT (not weight of down) = equal warmth.",Feb 2016,Nov 5 2016,0
6671,Question about down coats,1,10, As others have mentioned~ you're looking for the actual *amount* of down~ measured by weight~ in the jacket (this will roughly correlate with loft).   I've had good luck contacting manufacturers directly to get this info~ either with the chat (fastest) or email features of their websites. Patagonia~ OR~ and Montbell were all recent successes. It's a pain~ but worth it if you're investing in a jacket.,Mar 2011,Nov 5 2016,0

6677,Miura 45 Pack,1,5, I ordered one a couple weeks ago sight unseen and my intent was to write a full fledged review.  After testing it out a bit at home and looking it over I decided my money would be better spent on something else.  Since I was returning it I never gave it a legitimate field test.  I didn't take pictures or write anything up but I'll summarize my opinions below.   For the record~ I experimented with these two packing lists:   60m (10.1mm) Rope in Metolius Rope Bag   Climbing Shoes   Harness w/ATC   12 sport Draws   Gri-Gri   2 1 Qt Nalgenes   1 small Gatorade   Snacks   OR   Single Rack micro to #3   Doubles .5-2   12 slings w/biners (trad draws)   Climbing Shoes   Harness w/ATC   12 sport Draws   Gri-Gri   2 1 Qt Nalgenes   1 small Gatorade   Snacks   -Capacity   The Miura 45 didn't hold nearly as much as I expected.  The 45L figure includes three small pockets which detract from how much climbing gear it can contain.  The pockets are big enough to hold snacks or a guidebook but not much else because of the dimensions.  Two of the pockets are folder shaped.  This just isn't that useful when it only expands a couple inches and still invades the interior space.  I bought this pack expecting it to hold more than my Metolius Crag Station (41L) but in practice it is not even close.  The dimensions and design of the Miura 45 made it very difficult to get the same amount of stuff in it that I normally put in the Crag Station.  On a whim~ I put the loaded Miura inside the Crag Station and could still nearly close it.   -Carry   The Miura actually carried very well once it was loaded.  This was a pleasant surprise after seeing how sparse the waist and shoulder straps are.  The waist strap is webbing without padding~ which I am accustomed to but frankly seems pretty pointless for a crag pack.  I did not test the Miura with a partial load~ I imagine the lack of compression straps would allow everything just to sink to the bottom for whatever that's worth.   -Access   I fully expected this to be a highlight of the pack but I was really disappointed.  Once the pack is on the ground~ to unzip the bag completely you have to lift the top (where your head would be if carrying) up enough for you to slide the zipper past the ground.  If the zipper crossed the top of the pack just an inch or two higher it would make opening and closing much easier.  Also~ if the pack is really loaded up~ the drawbridge style is difficult to close.  I found that the easiest way get everything in was to half close the bag and use it like a top loader.   Overall~ the pack was made well and seemed to be of high quality but the inconveniences were too much to justify the high price tag.  Especially since the main feature (drawbridge opening) turned out to be a bust for me.,Jun 2010,Apr 16 2013,0
6678,Miura 45 Pack,1,6, I own one. Other than the full zip I dont like it. Good for cragging with short approaches. All my zipper tugs have broke. Its odd I love Arcteryx but this isn't their bwst product.,Jan 2014,Nov 1 2016,0

I tend to prefer wire gate biners~ but there are also plenty of solid gate options as well.  I ended up looking for sales and buying multi-packs and got down to about $10 per draw for Trango Phase and Camp Express draws.   The thicker ropes will be more durable~ but they also are tougher to feed through some belay devices.  A 70m is handy~ but if you are in an older area~ a 60m rope is probably going to be fine.  You may also be able to save money with a non-dry treated rope if you are only climbing in dry conditions.

6691,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,6," I'd be careful ignoring brands on ropes. There have been some really lame ropes in the past few years...   I'd stick with Mammut or Edelrid.

One popular ""Euro"" brand moved its production to Africa--endless problems. Some of the more popular US brands get so fuzzy so quickly~ it's a joke.    I'd spend a few bucks extra on a quality rope---and yeah~ 9.7/9.8 would be durable but still handle OK--and get a deal on anything else from a reputable company.    Good luck~ man~ enjoy!",Sep 2009,Oct 21 2016,0
6692,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,7, Save money on your draws~ but splurge a bit on a rope. 70 meter ropes are fantastic~ but I'd be wiling to bet most people get a 60 m rope for their first rope. This also depends largely where you will be climbing. I highly reccomended getting a rope from a highly reputable brand and if possible a rope that was lap coiled prior to packaging and shipping. I've had some crummy ropes~ but Mammut~ Petzl~ and Pinnacle ropes have all been great!,Nov 2014,Oct 21 2016,0
6693,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,8," Read up on your climbing area to decide rope length~ or if you plan to travel much just spring for the 70. Opens up a lot of options. I've always been a fan of a high quality 10.2mm rope for an everyday workhorse rope.   Draws... Just get the cheapest reputable draw you can find to start. You can upgrade later after you've developed preferences and still keep the cheap draws for really long routes~ hanging on a project~ etc. Some of my favorite options for cheap draws are the Cypher Firefly draw (I LOVE these draws for the price... I'd get the ""mixed"")~ the CAMP orbit wire~ and the Black Diamond livewire (the afore mentioned orange and sliver... although not orange and silver anymore). For a couple bucks more you can get the BD Posiwire~ which is worth it I think. I really like solid gates on the bolt side~ but that is entirely preference. IMO it's also worth buying a couple slings and turning two draws out of a rack into alpine draws.",Nov 2012,Oct 22 2016,0
6694,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,9, Buy a 70-80M rope~ you won't regret it.,Oct 2014,Oct 22 2016,0
6695,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,10, I'd recommend going for a nicer set of draws and a more inexpensive rope. It seems like most people tend to thrash their first rope pretty quickly~ but it's probably going to take you a little while to wear through the rope end biner on those draws. My preference is for draws with key lock solid gates (bent gate if you have them on the rope end as well). These handle much nicer when cleaning steep sport routes. I used wire gate draws for many years and they usually clip nicely~ are light~ but the gates aren't always as durable. Biner size is an important factor as well. Small biners may be light~ but might also be harder to clip.   Ropes-I'd recommend 9.8-10.2~ this should be pretty durable~ but still fee well through most belay devices. It seems like belay devices are being manufactured for smaller and smaller ropes these days and all my partners hated using the last 10.5 rope I had (retired several years ago) for this reason. look at route descriptions and talk to other climbers in your area to see if you can get by with a 60. Don't get a dry treated rope. If you get into ice climbing later then you can think about a dry rope.,Jan 2010,Oct 22 2016,0
6696,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,11, If you use a Grigri~ don't go too much thicker than 10mm.  It gets to be a pain to feed when lead belaying.  I prefer to not have to disengage the cam. As others mentioned~ 9.6-9.8 is perfect~ +/- .2 or so.,Jul 2014,Oct 22 2016,0
6697,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,12," As a newer sport climber myself~ I've also had to recently make this decision.    Draws: after researching for quite a while~ the only real safety concern present when comparing draws that are CE and UIAA certified is gate style. According to BDs QC lab studies~ the most common reasons for failure is loading the carbiner when the non-key lock carabiner is attached to the bolt improperly~ causing off axis loading. To quote KP~ black diamonds main QC guy~ ""literally a force twice someone's body weight bouncing on that thing will snap it"". The way to go is a solid~ keylock style gate for the bolt side~ or if you really prefer the wire~ the new(ish) hoodwire carabiners are also a safe option. For the rope side the choice is yours. I prefer the snappy action of a wire gate. Outside of the gate style~ go for affordable from a reputable brand. Black diamond sells quick packs of 6 draws from previous seasons (same biner~ new color and minor modifications to the dogbone) for really cheap. You could come out with 12 draws for under $120. Oh and a stiffer dogbone makes clipping a bit easier~ it's nice to not have the draw flopping around everywhere.    Rope: 70 meters because why not~ honestly. There's no route that you can't climb Bc your rope is too long~ only too short.    9.5-10. Honestly 10 is a freaking thick rope. But if it aspires confidence in you~ have at it. I like the feel of a 9.5~ feeds incredibly smooth through a gri-gri. Dry treatment if you carry your rope outside of your pack~ otherwise I don't think it's necessary for single pitch. Buy from a reputable brand.    Hope this helps.",May 2016,Oct 22 2016,0
6698,Rope and Draws~ The essentials ,1,13, One benefit to getting a 70m rope is that if you have to cut a chunk off the end~ your rope is still long enough for most (almost all) routes~ saving you from potentially having to buy another rope before your first one is totally worn out.,Feb 2015,Oct 22 2016,0

6703,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,0, I loved testing this harness out the last couple months and have plans to review an Arcteryx FL-365 and a CAMP Air CR soon. Please checkout the in-depth review here! northeastalpinestart.com/20… Petzl Sitta Harness,Nov 2012,Sep 19 2016,0
6704,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,1, Pretty accurate review imo. I've been climbing in the sitta since the spring and it hasn't let me down in terms of comfort or the ability to rack up whatever i need gear wise for a pitch. The rear gear loops are my only complaint. I know petzl makes them like that to work with a pack better~ but i wish they were abit stiffer~ like the adjama ones. Still able to lie flat but abit stiffer to make clipping/unclipping gear abit easier.,Mar 2015,Sep 19 2016,0

6706,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,3, While I don't own this harness or ice climb I think you're rating it too high for ice climbing.  The lack of the second set of ice clipper slots and non adjustable leg loops have got to be worth more than just 1.5 points.,Jun 2015,Oct 12 2016,0
6707,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,4,,Aug 2014,Oct 12 2016,0
6708,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,5, Fair points but I would argue that they are adjustable~ the stretchy elastic part easily fits over thicker layers.

6710,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,7, Great review Dave!   I really have enjoyed using mine. The weight cant be beat~ very comfortable on rappel and when at hanging belays considering its design. My only gripe would be the flimsy gear loops~ I wish that they were a bit stiffer~ but then you don't have the compressability and would lose some of the weight gain I would imagine~ but I've gotten used to them and clearly wasn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker. A bit pricey for what it is~ but cheaper than some of the lightweight competitors!,Jun 2008,Oct 25 2016,0
6711,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,8, It's an amazing piece of gear... one of the best pieces of equipment I own.,Jun 2013,Oct 25 2016,0
6712,Petzl Sitta Harness Review,1,9, needed a new harness before a trip i took to the Sierra~ thought this would do the trick~ I was sorely (literally) disappointed. Its my own dumb ass fault~ but a week in The Needles with this thing destroyed my hips. Not enough space for carrying double rack + draws~ not enough padding on hanging belays for my 200lb frame~ and honestly it just felt to slimmed down. I ended up getting my old (new version though) Arcteryx harness back and felt reunited. I think i just used it for the wrong application that first week~ as i was able to pack it in my bag on Mathes crest traverse later in the trip and use it while on the rappel. very compressible and lightweight harness.,Jul 2013,Oct 25 2016,0
6713,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,0, I'm looking for a beginner rope to get more into outdoor top roping. The easiest place to go for me is rei so this was the one I was looking into. Another rope similar for recommendations would be appreciated as well. Help a pal out.,Sep 2016,Sep 30 2016,0
6714,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,1, That is a great rope.  Recommend 70m.,Mar 2013,Sep 30 2016,0
6715,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,2, Cant speak for the Eternity~ but I recently bought the Mammut Gravity 10.2 60m as a first tope and it's been great. I almost bought the Eternity~ but since we do a lot of gym climbing~ it seemed the 10.2 might get some more mileage.  I was concerned it might be too fat vs the 9.8~ but after handling it and running through a grigri I have no complaints. Also seems like a lot of deals out there for the Gravity.,Apr 2016,Sep 30 2016,0
6716,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,3, Try the Mammut Infinity Protect rope.    They have three types of rope for every series they have. For that infinity series~ they have the dry~ the protect~ and the classic.     Classic has no protection.    Protect has the shell protected.    Dry is protected through--and-through.    Since I assume you will not be climbing during wet weather~ I'd recommend the Infinity Protect series. Only the shell is treated. This gives it some protection against abraision~ moisture~ and helps it be a bit more slick.    If you are into lead climbing~ the extra lightness is sweet. And as a belayer~ it is easier to pay out rope quickly.     70m is a little overkill for indoor climbing. But if you will use it for outdoor as well~ it's worth the little extra length.    Mammut Infinity ropes are time tested.    Look around. You can usually find a great deal if you are patient. I got mine (70m Infinity Protect) for $185.00 shipped).   In Christ: Raymond,Jun 2016,Sep 30 2016,0
6717,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,4, I have a dry 70m for alpine and a classic 60 for sport.  Both are awesome.  They handle much better than other people's ropes I  my opinion. I've convinced at least two people to get one after climbing on mine.,Feb 2016,Sep 30 2016,0

6722,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,9, I own this rope in the Classic (uncoated) version. It's a great rope—it handles very well—but it's starting to fuzz up earlier than I expected.

6723,Mammut 9.8 Eternity rope 60m,1,10, If you're just top roping and weight isn't an issue~ I'd go with a burly rope of 10+mm. It'll be a little more durable than the thinner ropes.   I just picked up a Bluewater Eliminator 60m non-dry on sale for $145 at Mountain Gear.

6724,Trango gear,1,0, Hi everyone~    I'm looking to buy Trango climbing gear (draws~rope~slings and carbiners)   What do you think of this brand?   I haven't heard much about it...   Thanks~   Ariel,May 2014,Oct 11 2015,0
6725,Trango gear,1,1, I've never used any of their gear aside from the Phase Alpine Draws~ but I really like those. The biners have a nice clipping feel~ they're light~ handle well. Not the highest end ultra light clean nose stuff~ but they work great and arent that expensive.,Dec 2013,Oct 11 2015,0

6728,Trango gear,1,4, Good stuff. Loved their cams~ (but they were confusing to my primary partner~ so I sold them and switched to a more popular brand). I use superfly and phase carabiners almost exclusively.,Oct 2009,Oct 11 2015,0
6729,Trango gear,1,5, I have a set of Trango Flex cams 1 - 8 that are probably close to ten years old now. (Roughly up to about a number 3 BD.) They're solid cams. No complaints. They catch falls and are easy to place. The extendable sling is handy. They could have a smoother action but they've also been used and abused for many years and I think that's responsible for a lot of the stiffness.,Oct 2009,Oct 11 2015,0
6730,Trango gear,1,6, I have the Trango Catalyst 9.0 rope and I love it. It's my go to rope for harder routes~ or longer routes. It seems to be durable~ it's slightly wire-ish~ but I like the feel of it. It catches well~ feeds well~ and is just a nice rope,Mar 2014,Oct 11 2015,0

6736,Trango gear,1,12, I have the Trango 9.9 rope~ I forget the name. Used it for the first time this weekend.

6738,Trango gear,1,14, +1 for the ultratape slings. using them for my alpine draws as well~ they are awesome and a bit more confidence inspiring than the super skinny ones. Not that I don't trust the 8mm stuff~ just something about that extra bit sometimes makes you feel better.    Trango stuff is good stuff. And I feel like they are a pretty innovative company.,Mar 2014,Oct 13 2015,0
6739,Trango gear,1,15, I think the only area that you'll find Trango lacking in is their cams. Most complaints on the cams are that they seem to be more prone to walking~ and are less durable than brands like metolius or BD.,Nov 2010,Oct 13 2015,0
6740,Trango gear,1,16, +1 for the diamond 9.4. It's been pretty durable so far. No fraying or core shots taking falls  and lots of hang dogging. It's stretchy though. Works with gri gri 2 perfectly.   I also have a trango crag pack. I see them more and more now and for a good reason. They are just perfect for rock climbing.   I also have the phase carabiners~ and liked them before the nano 22 came out. But after using the nano 22s the nanos are better than the phase in every way for racking cams.,Jul 2015,Oct 13 2015,0
6741,Trango gear,1,17, I use Trango alpine draws and love them. Buying them as a set were cheaper than building my own. The biners are light and clip easily. The slings are great too.,Jun 2015,Oct 13 2015,0

It amazes me that someone would make the decision to produce a belay device with a known failure mode that isn't caused by belayer error. While .001% seems small~ that's 1 in every 100~000 people. When the price is life~ why would somebody produce such a belay device?,May 2014,Oct 14 2015,0

6751,Trango gear,2,6, I've replaced the pin twice on my cinch. That's not a practice that Trango endorses~ but if you're the least bit handy it's easy with a punch~ hammer~ wood block and a grinder.    The pin does wear out faster than people would think~ especially if using skinny ropes. My advice is this~ if you're ever hanging on the rope belaying and the rope starts to slide after its locked up~ replace the device or the pin.    After a little while though~ the area that the rope pinches against opposite the pin starts to wear too~ leading to a decreased time between pin replacements.   It's a great device~ but it requires more attention than a grigri.   Their phase draws are great though. My wife has a set and so do most of my partners. Their ropes are good~ maybe not as good as Sterling or Mammut~ but Trango seam seems to meet the price point a lot of people look for.,Jan 2010,Oct 14 2015,0

6755,Trango gear,2,10, I'll argue Trango does make the best gear in a few categories. Ball nuts and Big Bros...Good luck finding those in the petzl or BD catalog.   I own some Rock Empire Robots. Which are the same as the flex cams of that generation. Actually made in the same czech factory as well. These were just my second set of cams at the time (now my 3rd~ so I rarely use them anymore except for TR anchors). I also own ball nuts and a cinch. I've never used the cinch for lead belaying but I do really like it for top roping/gym. Trango also has made some very nice ice tools over the years~ though I haven't used any in a long time. My newest Trango tool is the Squid. Interesting device~ not sure if it's worth the money but it definitely works.   Trango ropes are I believe made by Tendon which is a brand of Lanex. I had (still have) a set of lanex 8mm doubles. Those ropes were great~ lasting 4 rock and ice seasons and still looking good at retirement. I wish more Lanex ropes were available in the US. I am fairly certain Metolious ropes are also Lanex (actually~ I might be confusing Metolious with Trango~ I know Metolious ropes are Lanex).,Dec 2009,Nov 4 2015,0

6780,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,0," Anyone have experience driving / using / sleeping / living in a Honda Ridgeline for long climbing road trips?  Care to share your experience?   I haven't been able to find much information on living out of a Honda Ridgeline or accessing 4x4 only climbing areas on the internet.  On paper~ the 2017 Ridgeline looks like a better truck camping option than a Tacoma for most climbers that spend more time driving on cities / highways / dirt roads than they do rock crawling. The main drawbacks (Relative to a Tacoma) that I can see are:   1.  Ridgeline has a lower ground clearance than the Tacoma (7.9 in vs. 9.4 in).  Approach / departure / breaker over angles are 20.1/22.1/19.6 for the Ridgeline vs. 29/23.5/21 for the Tacoma.  However~ I doubt reduced clearance would be limiting for the majority of major climbing destinations.   2. The Ridgeline bed is shorter and shallower than the Tacoma.  Bed length is 5' 4"" for the Ridgeline vs. 6' for the Tacoma.  The bed depth is 16"" on the Ridgeline vs. 19"" for the Tacoma.  I am 5' 10""~ so I can sleep diagonally in the bed with the tailgate up and can fit another person with the tailgate down.     3. The tailgate does cannot be locked.  However~ it appears that there are some aftermarket options (with mixed reviews) to install a lock on the tailgate. However~ it appears that these drawbacks would be outweighed by the following factors:   1.  More storage space.  The Ridgeline access cab has more storage space than a Tacoma.  There is also lockable trunk under the bed (7.3 ft^3).  Option for factory installed roof rack.  For some reason~ it appears that Toyota does not offer a factory installed roof rack on the access cab models~ but they do offer this on the double cab Tacoma models.   2.  Significantly better on road performance / comfort.     3.  Marginally better gas mileage (~1 mpg difference).",Aug 2013,Sep 14 2016,0
6781,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,1, Damn~ they really fixed the body design problems of the Ridgeline. I would actually buy one now. That angled side thing they had just rear of the cab ruined any camper shell ideas. Not anymore. ,Jan 2001,Sep 14 2016,0
6782,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,2, looking at this one as well but the short bed has me bummed.  I will watch it for a few years to see what after market guys do for toppers etc.,Sep 2015,Sep 14 2016,0
6783,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,3," I think its the short bed that will really be a big drawback. If you're looking to go with the bed/cap camping option that is weather/critter proof then I don't think lowering the tailgate would be an option.    I have seen folks use a slide in camper in short bed trucks which I think is the best option out there for truck camping. Here you'd still have full size sleeping accommodations above the cab but you also have the the option to keep more supplies/people in the full sized rear bench as well. If going with option A (cap) I do highly recommend a ""full size"" 6' bed.",Jun 2010,Sep 14 2016,0
6784,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,4, So Honda doesn't make a long bed? Well~ that's a deal breaker.,Jan 2001,Sep 14 2016,0
6785,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,5," I just made the jump to a truck earlier this year to outfit for camping and I will agree with the above comments - bed length should be #1 IMO.   I am 5'7"" and I still wouldn't go with anything less than a 6' bed. Sleeping diagonally seems fine in theory~ but if your going to drop $20k on a new vehicle I would recommend getting something you can enjoy in the long run (and potentially share with a mate).   I ended up opting for a smaller cab (extended cab vs. crew cab) just for the longer bed. And I am super happy with my decision.",Dec 2014,Sep 14 2016,0

6788,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,8, I doubt a slide in camper would work on the Ridgeline. It would look like the older body style Ridgeline I saw on I25 with a full round bale of hay in the back. The rear bumper almost touched the ground because the rear independent suspension was fully collapsed riding on the bumpstops. Taco is a body on frame design~ a real truck. Ridgeline is a neutered truck/crossover (unit body design).,Nov 2012,Sep 14 2016,0
6789,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,9, When considering a cheaper large camping/climbing vehicle~ I thought a used Ridgeline and '06 Tundra Double-Cab were good choices (specifically the '06 was the sweet spot for that generation Tundra w/ 4 doors).    The Tundra gets shitty mileage~ but so does any Taco. That year Tundra DC is dead reliable and can be had for decent prices now. I imagine its size is actually similar to the newest Tacos.    The Ridgeline scores points for a bit better mpg and road manners and is 99% of the 'truck' most people would ever need.    I'm talking more about a $10k price range~ though~ vs brand new. You can buy a lot of gas and repairs with the $ saved over a new one...,Oct 2010,Sep 14 2016,0
6790,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,10, I will add in from my own experience that when I was shopping for a mid-sized truck I ended up with a Nissan Frontier.    They get bad reviews because critics say the styling is outdated but honestly I think it looks sharp~ the ride is good~ it can still tow~ you can get it in a 6 speed! The one I got was about $5-6k less than teh Tacoma equivalent (2012 w/ 25k miles~ 6-speed~ 6 foot bed~ extended cab).   Granted the Tacoma is a better vehicle but you pay the price for it.   For what its worth I have been super stoked on my Frontier.,Dec 2014,Sep 15 2016,0
6791,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,11," I have a 2016 tacoma~ 4x4 offroad access cab with the long bed.  I threw a topper on it and camp out of it.  At 5'8""~ I couldn't imagine trying to sleep in anything shorter.  Granted I usually have another person and 2 dogs in there too~ but length is perfect.  I built a platform above the wheel wells and can store all my crap underneath.  On road it feels like a Cadillac compared to my 13 year old explorer~ has very good road manners~ although with all the extra weight in the back I might upgrade to some stiffer rear springs.  Off road it rocks in stock form~ I don't like the tires that come on it and will be upgrading those~ they weren't very good in the snow.   I like the looks of it vs the ridgeline personally.  I was bummed that the access cab roof isn't drilled to install an aftermarket rack~ but I just set up the topper shell with yakima tracks and can hold all the extra stuff up there.   I don't really need a crew cab so the access cab works fine~ and between my sleeping platform storage and behind the seats in the cab I have plenty of room.  I do dislike that the rear seats in the access cab are like jump seats on an airplane~ they retract up and leave a little box on the floor (which has storage) but is annoying because it's not a flat surface to put stuff on.  I'm going to build a platform back there that is flat.   I've rambled on enough - if you want any more tacoma insight feel free to holler at me :)",Jul 2011,Sep 15 2016,0
6792,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,12, IMHO inferior to a real pickup. I worked at a Honda dealer up until dirtbagging recently. Overpriced~ undercapable (new word~ whatever). It's a Pilot with a bed. Pilots are nice~ but not really the kinda thing I'd wanna go dirtbag out of.   I'd go with a Tacoma.,Feb 2010,Sep 29 2016,0
6793,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,13, Nissan Frontier is another option as well... Picked mine up in 4x4 for approximately 5k less than a comparable taco which is what I originally wanted~ very happy with my choice...,May 2016,Oct 5 2016,0
6794,2017 Honda Ridgeline Truck Camping,1,14," Honda lover here too. (CR-V~ Civic~ Accord) Passed on the Honda due to shit ground clearance and bed length. Was going for the Tacoma until I found the F-150 4 X 4 with 18"" tires. It outperforms the Tacoma in all aspects. My #1 criteria which caused me to miss looking at the F-150 was reliability. However~ Consumer reports lists the reliability as the same for both the Tacoma and the Ford F-150 (above average). Coming back from Yosemite got 26.4 Mpg on the last stretch. I'm on some stupid rough roads (current climbing project) before the MPG goes below 20. 18 is the worst I've seen and that's on extremely deep rutted steep dirt backcountry forest roads. The extended cab F-150 has more back seat leg room~ is more comfortable~ bigger cab better payload - hauling and towing~ and is cheaper than a comparable 4 door 4wd Tacoma. (paid $33~245 for a 2016 Vs $35~700 for a Taco Turd)",Mar 2006,Oct 11 2016,0
6795,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,0, Disclaimer I'm still waiting to get my hands on the Ultralights but I did do some stat comparison that might be helpful for some. Is half a pound worth $200? Depends on the product AMIRITE?   I'm also giving away a brand new BD C4 #1~ details in the blog post... thanks for checking it out! northeastalpinestart.com/20…,Nov 2012,Sep 1 2016,0
6796,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,1, I have a mix and match set of C4s and DMMs.  I buy them interchangeably depending on which one is on sale when I pull the trigger.  In real use~ the extendable sling on the DMM is nice~ but not long enough to take the place of an alpine draw or a sling.  The best use is to extend the placement a bit so the biner does not sit against the rock in an awkward spot.   None of my DMMs are old enough for me to say that I have put them through the ringer~ but I like them.  In practice~ I don't see a difference that would make me convert into one cam over another.,Jun 2014,Sep 1 2016,0
6797,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,2, I'm a huge fan of the DMM Dragons~ and find that the extendable sling actually does take the place of an extendable runner and makes racking for the second really fast.  Picture this:   Leader places cam~ leaves racking biner through both strands of the extendable sling.  Uses 22cm quickdraw to clip gearside to the bartacked strand of the extendable sling.  Pull~ and voila you've got an shoulder length of extension on your piece.     To clean the second just has to unclip the draw~ and doesn't have to futz with clipping the racking biner to both strands on the sling.      Also~ I've got big hands so palming the Dragon feels more natural than the C4~ and having a more rigid stem with no floppy thumb looks makes it easier IMO to clean 'stuck' pieces.  Find that when I get to a belay I've almost always placed dragons and left C4's on the harness.  Have used the dragons quite a bit and they take a beating really well.  Took a lot of falls this season so far~ and the dragons stand up to the beating just as well as the C4's do.     When it comes to the smaller cams: 0.5-0.3 using a Dragon2 with the expanded lobe surface area is really comforting.  They walk noticeably less and just 'feel' much more solid in placements~ especially slightly flaring ones.  If you're looking for new cams and have the coin~ I'd go for the Dragon2.  Feel about as safe as the U stem Totems without the bulky racking.   Getting into aid and find the dragons extendable really doesn't matter to me... yet.  I feel better aiding off of them as well because they seem to deform less frequently/severely than the C4's after cleaning from wonky placements.,Apr 2012,Sep 1 2016,0
6798,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,3, I checked out the Ultralights in the store the other day. For me~ I wouldn't buy them even if they were cheaper.   I tend to keep my gear for a long time. Many of my Camalots are the generation prior to C4 and some are even older. I have some forged friends that I'll use on occasion too.    That dyneema thumb loop just screams built in obsolescence to me. I keep my gear too long for that.   I prefer the C4 to the Dragon for ease of placement. I really like the thumb loop. Medic is right about the extendable sling though~ I don't have to extend a full a 2 feet that often so the Dragon sling is pretty appropriate much of the time. For me though~ my hardest climbs don't require extension or at least the spot that gets extended isn't the hard part~ so ease of placement of C4's win.,Oct 2012,Sep 1 2016,0
6799,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,4, You should include the new Wild Country double axel cams in this review.  They are basically an improved C4.  Nearly the same range~ color~ thumb loop and weight.  But~ higher quality and an extendable sling which I find quite useful.  I have had Draggons and many C4's.  I think this is the best cam out there now in the medium and large sizes when considering all factors~ quality~ price~ weight~ range~ extension~ etc.,Apr 2006,Sep 1 2016,0
6800,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,5, FYI You are comparing the older style DMM Dragon cams.   The 2.0 version came out earlier this year alongside the BD UL's.  The Dragons 2.0 are awesome.  They are lighter than the originals cams you reviewed here along with the extendable slings will save you even more weight.    The camming lobes on the Dragons 2's set a new standard and I frequently find myself reaching for the Dragon first over the UL's.    DMM Dragon Cams Old (Left) and new (Right),Aug 2014,Sep 1 2016,0
6801,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,6, Yeah~ I'd love to hear from more people who've  used the new Wild Country friends. They almost seem like a cross between the Camalots and Dragon 2's. Double axel~ thumb loop~ and extendable sling- best of both worlds maybe? I'm particularly interested in how the extendable compares to the one on the Dragons~ as well as the lobes.,Jul 2016,Sep 1 2016,0
6802,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,7, ^^^^  Yes~ they are great.  I have 3 of them now.  I will probably replace all my C4's with them over time. Better than the Dragon and C4 imo.   Extendable sling is a bit wider than the dragon and more user friendly.  Great trigger action.  And I prefer the thumb loop of C4's over the dragon's stub.  The Wild Country thumb loop is much like the C4.  The lobe surface is much like the dragon.,Apr 2006,Sep 1 2016,0
6803,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,8," I have #1 and #2 BD ultralight~ and I must say I'm impressed. I have a lot of old style pre C4 camalots~ so the weight savings is considerably more~ maybe close to 40%? Between a lot of days in eldo~ mt whitney alpine~ and multiple days in RMNP alpine I have been hammering them the last part of the summer and they are holding up just fine. From a friend of mine who just bought a full set: ""So BD says they are designed to last 5 years which means I will use them for 7 years. At that point the technology will have changed I will be ready to replace/upgrade anyways."" That sold me right then and there.",Feb 2006,Oct 3 2016,0

6805,DMM Dragons vs. BD C4's vs. BD Ultralights,1,10," I'll second Greg D's comments on the new Friends. I have the .5~ .75~ 1 and 2 and have gotten them out enough to have a pretty good sense of how well they work but not their durability.    They are extremely similar to C4's~ the sizing is very slightly bigger that the corresponding C4~ but not enough to fill in between sizes. I actually would have liked it if they sized them exactly between the C4 sizes~ but this way they match the C4's both in size and color coding. I like the extendable sling~ but it doesn't take the place of a runner. I might leave home a couple of draws with these on the rack. The anodizing has been machined  off the cam surfaces (like the Dragons) and the ""bite"" seems better that a slippery new anodized cam. The trigger action is light which feels nice~ but I'm not sure if the weaker springs cause them to walk more than a C4.   Overall they are an incremental step up from Camalot C4's. I hope Wild Country makes a .3 and .4 which are my two favorite sizes!",Nov 2001,Oct 4 2016,0

6813,Trango 16mm Nylon Slings,1,0, Whenever I buy a couple slings I usually try to get something different than what I've already got~ just for variety~ and to see different products. These slings weren't quite what I expected~ so I thought I'd post a quick review to let other's know.   First of all~ here are the slings I purchased: trango.com/p-334-nylon-slin…   I bought two of the 60cm~ and two of the 30cm.   The main differences from most slings I'm used to is the sling material itself. I'm used to smooth finished webbing~ but the sling webbing material is ribbed~ like you'd find in mil-spec bulk webbing. If you look closely at the picture you can see this. This ribbed construction also makes the sling fairly stiff. When held under it's own weight it will form a very distinct oval shape~ instead of just hanging straight down~ slack. This may make it more difficult to work with~ or rack (other than over the shoulder). I'm hoping with use they will soften up.   Other than the stiffness~ the slings are well made~ and priced right. The 16mm thickness does reduce physical bulk a bit over the 18mm Metolius and BD slings I've used~ although the stiffness may make them more unwieldy when not worn over the shoulder. They are also rated to 25kN - actually stronger than the BD and Metolius slings (not that the 3kN difference really matters).   I haven't used them to extend a placement yet~ but don't anticipate any problems.   I'll try to post some pictures later.,Feb 2016,Jul 21 2016,0
6814,Trango 16mm Nylon Slings,1,1, Your description reminds me a bit of these: wildcountry.com/en/16mm-nyl…   Sure isn't fast and light~ but the 240cm have served me well for many a top rope :),Apr 2015,Sep 29 2016,0

6817,Climbing Technology Click-Up - opinions?,1,2, I have been using an alpine up for 4 years.  All the comments below apply to the alpine up.  I imagine the click-up is similar being a single rope version of the alpine up.   It belays well~ feeds rope well~ rappels very well (although can twist the rope)~ the assisted lock works well.  I particular like that the assisted lock has to be explicitly unlocked; unweighting the rope does not unlock the device.  For belaying the second you can easily belay with the device in locked mode.  The flow of the rope through the device is directionally dependent and pulling slack though a locked device is easy.   It biggest drawback is that it is heavy and bulky. The bulk is sometimes a problem when using the device in guide mode and pulling the rope in guide mode could be a bit easier.   As with many devices of this sort the choice belay biner is important.  The one that comes with the devices is good and durable but will eventually wear out.  I now use a edelrid HMS bruce steel carabiner which I suspect will never wear out.  Although it adds even more weight to the belay system. :(.    I think this style of belay device is the much better than tube style device (ATC) and the grigri.  I look forward to other competitors and climbing technology refining the design over the next few years. I would love to see a lighter and less bulky version of the alpine-up.   I like the alpine-up so much I bought by climbing partner one.,Feb 2006,Sep 27 2016,0

6829,Camp Matik belay device,1,0, So the Camp device arrived in the mail a couple days ago. The weight is the first thing you notice. It's noticeably heavier than the orginal Grigri. Still though if the device works like Camp says I can live with it.     I took it to Earth Treks last night. I figured mess with it there where my leader can crater onto a mat. The device worked good considering the 10.2 rope. The device never locked up pulling slack like a Grigri. Pulling slack wasn't easy but again 10.2 rope. Dropping somebody was NOT the problem. Actually it was the opposite. I couldn't lower without the safety catch locking up when top roping. I read the directions and saw the high friction method. That's a real PITA. The ropes at the gym were 10.2mm which is at the limit of the device. Anyone have advice? I know that might be tough with the Matik being so new.    I'm going to try it outside this weekend or if I can find a partner tomorrow. I'm going to use a 10.2 and a 9.1. I'll post the results. I think outdoors is where the Matik will shine. I would imagine there's too much friction between worn 10.2 gym ropes and the anchors there.    Please hit me up here if you've used the Camp Matik,Jul 2012,Apr 30 2015,0
6830,Camp Matik belay device,1,1, The Matik's cam engages softly allowing a bit of rope to slip through. That's suppose to lower the force exerted on the piece of gear you fall on and or give a softer catch. Kinda like a tube style device~ an ATC. Plus it's got a safety catch that locks if the lever is opened too fast.     I bought it because my wife has no problem catching me at the gym but outside.. Forget about it. She wants a Grigri and a tree to anchor to. I got her away from the tree anchor thing but she wants a Grigri. I thought this would work well for her needs while keeping gear from ripping out. I dropped weight and increased strength the last two months. I'm getting on routes~ nothing hard but 5.7-5.8 that don't have any ledges~ that I might fall. So I want my wife~ Kathy to feel confident. The fact we go climbing and have a good time I'll buy anything to keep that happening. I got some friends who their wives... Well that's another thread.,Jul 2012,Apr 30 2015,0

6833,Camp Matik belay device,1,4, I've used the Matik for a minute now and have some more to write.    The Camp Matik works great for belaying a leader and top roping outside. The device does seem to give a soft catch. Lowering isn't a struggle either. The device works well with a 9.1 or a 10.2 rope. The Matik's cam doesn't grab as quick as a  Grigri.    Again the Matik doesn't work in the gym. The anchors create so much friction that the safety catch constantly engages. Lowering sucks! The lead ropes in my gym are worn 10.2mm. These ropes don't feed well through the Matik.    I would have to catch a couple more falls before I'm sold on this thing.,Jul 2012,May 20 2015,0

6836,Camp Matik belay device,1,7, Why  not use a Grigri? It's tried~ tested~ easy~ and dependable with proper use. With such a weight difference between you the climber and a lighter belayer~ the catch will be soft. Particularly since you've gotten away from tying the belayer down. A proper belay provides a much softer catch regardless of device than an improper belay and tube style device. Take your belayers to the gym and take a ton of whippers on all types of terrain so you're both confident in falling/catching.,Jan 2011,May 20 2015,0
6837,Camp Matik belay device,1,8, Jesse~    Thanks for the suggestions. My wife and friends do use a Grigri.

6841,rubbit by armaid.,1,0, I just received the Rubbit by Armaid. armaid.com/store/products/7…    My concerns about the Rubbit were how well does it get the bicep and how well does the rubber base keep it in place. As the Armaid is able to strap to your leg.         After talking with customer service~ they assured me that this wasn't a big deal. I was super happy I found this to be true. I could put it on my leg and get at my bicep easily.        I found the green dog toy looking roller to be surprisingly firm. It really does work it's way in there very well. However I would like to see more attachments like the beads on Armaid.  They did they were coming out with one but were having difficulty with manufacturing. So I'll look for that soon.        The second function of being able to break it apart and use it on your legs is actually really nice. I figure well I have a foam roller for that. But I was able to get into harder to reach places on my legs.       With the price at 50 I think this is pretty good product~ I'd still like to see a few more attachments so I can vary the pressure of my roll~ So I'm hoping they come out with those soon.   Overall I'm happy with it. the real question is will it help stay off tendonitis or not. Well I don't have an answer for that but will update with longer term use.   I also really found this video useful especially trigger point part. armaid.com/page/2-3060/rubb…  Rubbit in Packaging.  front of the original packaging    out of the box.  this rubber is super sticky~ I was surprised by this.  the green roller side come apart to use by itself.,Nov 2010,Mar 26 2016,0
6842,rubbit by armaid.,1,1, I just got one of these too. More convenient and effective than using a normal foam roller against a wall~ which is what I had been doing. FWIW that has been helpful in reducing the pain from medial epicondylitis~ so I expect the Rubbit to do even better.,Jul 2015,Mar 27 2016,0
6843,rubbit by armaid.,1,2, Hi Guys~ for the Rubbit~ was it able to do away with your tendinitis problems in your elbows?    I like the smaller size and portability of the Rubbit (now called RolFlex)~ but there aren't enough reviews out that I see for it. I know the regular ArmAid device works well for the arms~ but I'd also like to use a device for the rest of the body. At this point~ I guess I'd be leaning towards the original ArmAid~ since based on people's reviews it definitely works for tendinitis~ and has the other attachments of varying densitiies already available.    Thanks for any follow ups. Cheers,Jan 2016,Aug 28 2016,0

6864,Lace up to velcro conversion by Rock and Resole,1,0, My wife is very particular about her shoes.    She broke a sesamoid a few years ago~ and still has to deal with that.    She can bend her toes backwards more than anybody I've ever seen. This isn't helpful as it makes it hard to edge.   Fortunately~ she found a shoe she likes and isn't hard on them~ so they last well.  Red Chili lace-ups But she envied velcros~ the ease of popping them off and giving poor tired feet a break.   Somehow she got Rock and Resole interested...  Red Chilis - velcro It's not exactly cheap~ but it came out great. (In the interest of full disclosure~ the photos are two different pair. I didn't have the foresight to get before and after pics.),Nov 2007,Jul 22 2016,0
6865,Sportiva Otaki,1,0, I've had the Sportiva Otakis for a little over a month and have put about 15 days of climbing on them: about 20-25 hours of bouldering and maybe 100 pitches. I thought I'd give some initial impressions. TLDR: it's a very nice shoe for granite-style edging and cracks.   My feet measure 10.5 and are duck shaped. Shoes that are narrow at the forefoot make my feet go numb. So I typically wear running shoes anywhere from size 11 to 12~ but generally 11.5 fits right. I wear a 42.5 in the Solution and Genius~ 43 in the Katana Lace and TC Pro (my feet go numb in those)~ 44 in the Instinct VS~ 44-44.5 in the Feroce~ 10.5 in Anasazi Pinks~ and I got the Otaki in a 43. Until now the Instinct VS has been my favorite shoe.   The Otaki is apparently the successor to the Katana. In spite of that~ I was never a fan of either the Katana or Katana Lace. I like Velcro shoes~ and I love the Otaki.   In 43 the Otaki fit with my toes slightly bent at the end when new. After 15 days out they are now almost no longer bent.   The toe box is wide and low in profile. At first I thought it was a bit too low as the metal on the forward strap pressed into the outside tops of the balls of my feet uncomfortably. I almost sent them back because of that. I packed them up and everything. But I tried them on again the next morning and changed my mind. Now glad I did. After just a few days of climbing/stretch~ that pressure went away.   No shoe is ideal for every terrain. In spite of that~ I'm always on the lookout for a shoe that works for most of what I do: trad and sport edging~ finger cracks~ and steep bolted routes. The Otaki is the closest I've found for the style of climbing I like to do. I like them enough to write my first shoe review on here.   The High Country of NC is a place of edges: steep~ featured stone with sharp jugs and vertical faces of razor blade holds. The Otaki has been great for it. It's stiff and they don't like to roll off of stuff.   But they excel on a certain other kind of hold too that I was curious about: those sloping shitty small irregular edges common on slabbier 5.11 and harder around here. They smear remarkably well. The Otaki is similar in shape to the Instinct VS~ but I think the Instinct VS sucks at that type of edge/smear. The Instinct VS just doesn't seem to smear that well for me. The Otaki has been great for it.   The low profile toe works well in finger cracks: they are comfortable for a moderately downturned shoe. I wish they didn't have the front strap because straps tend to get destroyed in cracks. They could've made the shoe similar in strap design to the new Skwama.   The low profile of the toe also allows you to get the toe into tiny recessed slot edges that are typically good for fingertips but sometimes too narrow to get your toe into securely with shoes like the Genius that are tall and blunt at the toe.   They are downturned enough to let you toegrab at protrusions when on steep stuff and bouldering. Not quite as secure as a Genius or Solution~ but good enough for me most of the time. Toehooks might be better if they had some kind of rubber or something over the toe~ but they might suffer in other ways if they did.   The Otaki has a strip of stiff rubber on the inside of each heel that is advertised to help prevent heel deformation when heelhooking. I honestly couldn't tell you if I've noticed anything with it. The shoe heelhooks as well as the Instinct VS~ but I haven't noticed anything special.   I couldn't tell you how they perform on pure slab. Even though NC is kind of famous for slab~ it's not super common within an hour of where I live.   Anyway~ I just thought I'd throw this out there because there have been no reviews yet. I'm guessing this shoe will become popular.,Oct 2007,Jul 19 2016,1
6866,Sportiva Otaki,1,1, I just got some in the mail 3 days ago.  The 39 fits amazing and seems to be slightly wider than the Miura VS.  I can't wait to try them on rock.,Aug 2008,Jul 19 2016,0
6867,Sportiva Otaki,1,2, Thanks for the review!  I want to order a pair in either 40 or 40.5. My favorite shoes are the Instinct VS (all around aggressive sport & bouldering~ and Katana Lace for longer and more casual sport routes. I have a narrow heel and slightly wide low volume forefoot.   Does the Otaki fit bigger/wider than the Katana Lace?   Does they Otaki fit bigger/wider than the Instinct VS?   And would you say the Otaki is just slightly softer than then Katana Lace~ at least in the toes?   I am a 10.5/11 street (11-11.5 running) and wear now~   40.5 Katana Lace (fit PERFECT after break in)   41 instinct VS (really tight when new but broken in are ok for short periods)   Other shoes I have worn   40 solution (tight as hell~ use to wear bouldering and curse the pain and narrow toes)   39 Python (perfect and super comfortable~ also owned 38.5 which worked)   39.5/40 Futura (own 39.5 and they are too small except for quick bouldering),Jan 2015,Jul 20 2016,0
6868,Sportiva Otaki,1,3, To be honest~ I don't remember my Katana Lace fit too well. I never liked them much~ and didn't wear them too much.   The Instinct VS is higher in volume all around than the Otaki. Overall width in the forefoot between my resoled Instinct VS and the Otaki feels about the same. However~ the Instinct has a lot of volume up and down that the Otaki doesn't have. In that way~ I think the Otaki is more precise. In addition~ I have some space in the heel on both shoes. More space in the heel of the Instinct VS. But the Instinct VS heel is basically all rubber and not as easy to deform. The Otaki heel has less air space~ but it has some cloth upper near the heel not covered in rubber~ so it may deform more despite the S-heel.   The Otaki will likely be my all around shoe for a while for unknown trad and sport routes. I'll retain the Instinct VS for overhanging bouldering due to the more aggressive toe and rubber on the top of the toe. And the jury is still out on if the Otaki will replace my Anasazi Pinks for slab and general crack climbing.,Oct 2007,Jul 20 2016,0
6869,Sportiva Otaki,1,4, Interesting~ sounds like maybe the 40.5 would be the way to go. I found the Instinct VS to be fairly low volume. The heel~ there is some dead space if I went with a more comfortable size but these are some of the best fitting shoes for low volume feet I have found. Lots of my shoes are too small because I cram my foot to get rid of dead space. The heel of my Katanas is not that technical for me at that size. I tried a 40 first but it was super brutal on the toes.   My local gym only has a size 45 of the Otaki in stock so far and they look wide and voluminous but considering the size its really hard to tell.,Jan 2015,Jul 20 2016,0
6870,Sportiva Otaki,1,5, Haha...sounds like a shoe for me and my pencil feet to avoid.  KL/TC Pro fit well but Solutions are hella baggy unless I go toe-crushing tight.,Jul 2014,Jul 20 2016,0
6871,Sportiva Otaki,1,6, I think the rand tension of the Instinct VS is to blame for some of the feeling of scrunched up feet. The Instinct VS seems to force my big toe forward and downward. The Otaki is more relaxed in spite of a similar downturn profile,Oct 2007,Jul 20 2016,0
6872,Sportiva Otaki,1,7, How do you guys with Size 10+ street shoes wear a 40.5 in climbing shoes? I'm a 9.5 street shoe and my size 41 Solutions break my toes off~ completely broken in had them for 2 years and even threw them in the oven twice. My Muira VS are a 41.5 and only the heel is a little loose (bc I have narrow heels and wide forefoot) after maybe 25 pitches. I guess my feet just swell up a lot while climbing~ after a couple pitches even my broken down Finales feel tight.,Jul 2013,Jul 20 2016,0
6873,Sportiva Otaki,1,8, I climbed in my new Otakis tonight for the first time and I'm really impressed. They broke in right away with zero discomfort. I wear a 10.5-11 street shoe~ 44.5 in most of my non-climbing sportivas~ and I thought a size 41 in these was perfect for climbing routes. Easily the most comfortable shoe I've worn and performs extremely well on all terrain. They toe-hook better than I expected too.    They don't really compare to anything else on the market. Stiff/supportive without compromising sensitivity. The heel works excellent and doesn't twist/deform when you crank on them. Edging is excellent and confidence-inspiring. I can see these working really well on technical/vertical terrain like Shelf Road or Smith. Fit is on the large side for sure. Genius fits about a half size small~ these fit about a half size large. A 41 in these is more comfortable to me than my 41.5 Solutions. The toe-box is wide and snug at the same time.    These are going to become a classic for sure. Looking forward to the lace-up version. Great Katana replacement~ superior in every way~ although I think I like the simple yellow/black old Katana colors more.,Jul 2010,Jul 20 2016,0

6877,Wooden hangboard,1,1," I train on wooden hangboards at least 3 times a week and I like them alot. Plastic for me wears down my hands a lot and is more grippy. Wood wears down hands but its smoother so you have to work harder to hold on. I really think its personal preference. The best wooden hangboards I have found are the Beastmakers from the dudes in England. Another company from England would be Crusher. See Stevie Haston's blog for a laugh and some awesomeness with the Crusher boards. They really have a lock down on training I think. I love my wooden hangboard and would never trade it for plastic.    And as for a ""no variety of grips"" I dont think that represents the Beastmaker or Crusher hangboards. Maybe I'm just dumb and new at this training thing (actually I'll just admit that I'm dumb and dont totally know whats up) but it took me 2 months to figure out all the different types of holds on the Beastmaker 2000 board! Its really designed to narrow in on the strength of each individual finger and help you progress in that.    But all in all this is for sure a matter of personal preference and I would'nt say that I'm an ""only wooden hangboard or death"" kinda guy.

6900,LaSportiva TX2's Approach Shoes,1,1, Hi David! We met at the North End last February. I introduced myself walking past while you were working.   Great reviews on the shoes and the Petzl pack. I think you should go back to just posting the link. Your website review with pictures and bigger print is much better to read than what's here. I also found your review on the Bug by going to your site. I understand why you took the time to post the review so just letting you know not everyone hates on blogs.

Yup...light~ really nice hanging on the harness for the walk off.    I bought these shortly after the La Sportiva rep said that they ""used their stickiest rubber"".  My only fault is that he should have said ""The stickiest rubber that they use on their approach shoes.""

6918,What are your favorite packs for both multipitch and cragging?,1,2, Different size packs for different uses. I'm sure you can find one that will do both~ but it won't be as good as the individual ones for the specific use.   For carrying on a multipitch~ you want as small as possible to carry what you need. That will vary depending on whether you are carrying shoes for the descent. Some people prefer to clip everything to their harness~ but that is strictly a personal preference over carrying a small pack. Neither is right or wrong.   For cragging~ you can carry a much larger pack to stow everything.,Nov 2009,Mar 22 2016,0

6926,What are your favorite packs for both multipitch and cragging?,1,10, For multi-pitch climbs~ I'll carry the 20+-year-old 'bullet' off my BD Super Genius.

It's also super-clean so it doesn't hang up on anything~ and has a tiny excuse of a waist belt that doesn't interfere with a harness.   The Super Genius itself is a good one~ but can be a little small. I upgraded to the Mtn. Hardwear Splitter a few years ago~ and like it very much. It holds and organizes *everything* thanks to internal gear loops and pockets. It also came with its own ground tarp. Since it's made of what amounts to truck-tarp vinyl~ it stays dry and wears like iron.    I'll use the Splitter to lug stuff in to wherever I'm climbing~ whatever I'm climbing.

6944,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,0, Out of practical necessity~ it seems like gear reviewers don’t get to spend all that much time with a given product before writing a review on it. This is not going to be one of those reviews. I’ve been using the Matik for about 4 months~ and over that time I have accrued an estimated 800-1000 belay/rappel cycles on the device in a variety of capacities.    By profession~ I am a climbing gym manager~ performance climbing coach~ and guide (AMGA SPI). Needless to say~ I belay a lot.    Belay technology is always improving~ and based on my everyday professional lifestyle~ it behooves me to stay caught up with emerging trends and technologies. I forget how I stumbled upon the Matik~ but after watching the product video from CAMP~ I was quite intrigued at the supposed features the device brought to the table. I will be referencing the functions of the device during this review~ so if you haven’t seen it yet~ spend a few minutes watching it: youtube.com/watch?v=UIgBszD…   I ended up calling Glen with CAMP sales and he was gracious enough to send me a product sample at dealer cost (which I paid for out of pocket). In the last 3-4 months I have used the device in the following capacities- distributed over both professional and recreational use:   Outdoor lead belaying   Outdoor TR belaying   Belaying a 2nd from above on multipitch terrain   Single strand rappelling   Indoor lead belaying   Indoor TR belaying   High angle positioning for wall maintenance~ and route setting   Progress capture   Working in the gym environment has allowed me to use the device on a variety of rope configurations as well. So far I have used the following (some of which deliberately fall outside of the device’s intended range of 8.6-10.2):   Mammut Serenity 8.7 (TR/Lead)   Mammut Revelation 9.2 (TR/Lead/Top Belay)   Sterling Nano 9.2 (Lead)   Sterling Ion 9.3 (Lead)   Sterling Helix 9.5 (TR/Lead)   Mammut Infinity 9.8 (TR/Lead)   Sterling Velocity 9.8 (TR/Lead)   Mammut Galaxy 10.2 (TR)   Sterling ReVo 10.2 (TR)   Sterling Marathon 10.4 (TR/Lead/Top Belay)   Sterling Gym Classic 10.4  (TR)   Sterling Marathon 10.7 (TR)   I’ll be primarily comparing the Matik to the ubiquitous Grigri platform~ as Petzl’s product makes up over 90% of the assisted locking devices in circulation. The Matik is extremely well built~ as is immediately apparent upon first handling one. They are about the same size as a GriGri 2~ but closer to the weight of a Grigri 1 due to the significant amount of stainless steel that went into the design. Like the Grigri~ there are 2 techniques the user must be proficient with- paying out slack in a traditional plate style motion~ and overriding the camming mechanism to pay out slack quickly. You can watch the video to see the techniques.   Pros and Cons vs the Grigri: ,Mar 2007,Jun 3 2016,2
6945,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,1, I've been using a mega Jul for a while~ used to use a cinch but wore out multiple devices. Was thinking about going back to a grigri. If you had to pick~ all other things equal~ what would you pick,Jan 2010,Jun 3 2016,0

6947,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,3, I bought a CAMP Matik about 18 months ago.     The Matik sucks!!    In the gym 0/10    Toproping with 9.8mm 1/10    Lowering with 9.8mm 0/10    Leading and lowering with 9.1mm 8/10    If you're sport cragging with a skinny rope the Matik is good. Everything else use another device.    I have a Camp Matik at the Rock and Snow Annex. It's been there for over year. No buyers at $100. Not even a tire kicker..

6952,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,8, I've been using a Grigri 2 and an ATC-Guide for quite a while now and have no complaints. But now my wife and 9 year old son have started climbing. It's become a family endeavour. That being said~ I'm always looking for any means of creating additional safety. I've opted for a pair of thicker(9.8) Sterling Velocity ropes~ tossed most of my older gear in favor of new gear with a real emphasis on burliness~ dependability~ and longevity. When it comes to my belay device~ I'm reluctant to change... However the added safety elements and idiot-proof factor have forced me to revisit the issue. If it really is easier on the rope and climber in lead a fall~ and the anti panic feature works~ then I think I can look right past the price tag and minor inconveniences it may present.    Would this be a good piece of gear for my wife and son to use~ under my supervision? In other words~ does the Matik effect margin of error or  Make my family any safer than a Grigri? Even a minor improvement in that department would~ in my mind~ be totally worth the price of admission.,May 2016,Jun 10 2016,0

6956,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,12, That's cool. You really can't screw it up. It does look a little like a part from a salvage yard. But hey~ if it is safer for my  wife and kid~ then I'm cool with steam punk climbing gear.    I wish DMM would get into the assisted breaking belay device game. I think that they would produce a really top-shelf product... That also looked cool. I have a pivot and it's great. DMM~ If you're listening~ I would like a new belay device from Whales. And if you can  swing it~ make the whole thing that God awful lime green color you guys seem to like.,May 2016,Jun 11 2016,0
6957,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,13, It doesn't seem like the Matik has enough advantages over the grigri to be worth the higher price. At least not in my case~ I'm still climbing on thicker ropes. Also~ the grigri can be very ambidextrous~ I have always belayed left handed on my grigri. I will be curious to see the Revo in action~ but I'd still be unlikely to buy another belay device anytime soon.,Jan 2015,Jun 11 2016,0
6958,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,14, I did check that thing out prior to writing this review actually. Looks totally sweet! One thing that the Matik excels at is force reduction throughout the system. The Revo appears to lock up super hard~ which will increase force on protection~ and the climber. I wouldn't worry about this as much in a lead scenario~ as belayers should be trained on giving a soft catch regardless of the device. I see it's value the most in belaying directly off an anchor~ both with force reduction~ and the fact that it doesn't require a traditional redirect and the problems associated with it.,Mar 2007,Jun 12 2016,0
6959,CAMP Matik- a comprehensive review,1,15, Finally got my hands on one of these. Tried it out at home. Rapped off the roof a couple times. Then took it out climbing the next day. I love it. More intuitive to use than a Grigri. I had no problems paying out slack~ lowering~ or rappelling. One thing I will say though is that guy who did this review is spot on about the type and diameter of the rope making a big difference. My Sterling 9.8mm was smooth and gave me zero problems. My buddies older~ fuzzy~ 10mm rope was not as easy to pay out  slack. Still~ seemed easier than my Grigri. If you watch the video~ and use it the way Camp suggests~ instead of just trying to use it just like your Grigri~ it should be a breeze.,May 2016,Jun 26 2016,0

6963,Excellent Princeton Tec Warranty/Service,1,0," Just wanted to give a shout-out to Princeton Tec for an excellent warranty & customer service experience.   I had a 15-year-old Quad headlamp. It's an excellent product~ sturdy~ bright and reliable. A year or so ago the ""low battery"" light started flashing even with brand-new batteries and the batteries would drain even while the lamp was off and in a drawer. I looked around for a replacement~ which at first I couldn't find.    So I contacted Princeton Tec in the hopes of buying a replacement directly from them~ or paying to have it fixed. They communicated with me promptly and politely. They immediately offered to fix it for free~ no questions asked. This surprised me because IMO fifteen years is a reasonable expectation for the life of a product like that.    Anyhow~ I sent it in~ and within a week they had sent me a brand-new replacement. In the meantime~ I found the lamp for retail and bought a second one.   They make a great product and I was pleased with the warranty department.",Mar 2006,Aug 30 2015,0

They have my future business.,Sep 2014,Jun 26 2016,0
6965,"Matt Samet's ""DEATH GRIP"" reviewed....",1,0," Bruce Lee famously delivered a ""one inch punch"" with enough power to blast volunteers back from his closed fist~ swept off their feet by the force of Bruce's impossible power and refined technique. A similar experience awaits the unsuspecting reader of Matt Samet's ""DEATH GRIP""~ a confesional tale unlike any other climbing-oriented writing that I can think of.    For comparison~ I point to Mark Twight's Kiss or Kill~ in which layers of socialization~ tolerance~ self-esteem~ and interest in living long enough to grow old are peeled back to expose the frayed edges of a soul sharpened through the process of pushing past all limits. Twight's writing defined the event horizon of intensity in climbing writing for many years until now; while Samet's tale is much less focused on the details of particular climbs~ the grinding brutality of the years that Samet lived in the grips of benzodiazepam addiction and detox makes Twight seem like a sunny morning paging through pictures of cute cats.    Death Grip is unique in its virtuosic choice of words~ which sent me scrambling for an unabridged dictionary more than once~ its subject matter~ which has not been even hinted at within the sphere of climbing literature~ and for its unflinching honesty. Matt Samet has bared his soul in an approachable and at times terrifying manner-you sense at numerous points in the narrative that yourself and your friends and family could easily have been swept into the riptide of Big Pharma toxicity and head control that very nearly destroyed the author.    Without doubt~ this book is a monumental acheivement personally for the author~ as well as an important read for anyone who's life has been shadowed by depression and the myriad traps set by our mental health ""system"" has set for the unsuspecting patient for whom a brief slip from the well-lit path of normalcy can become a nighmare slide into a lurching ocean of terror and isolation.    Read this one~ share it with a friend. Death Grip deserves reckoning as one of the most significant non-climbing narratives by a climber~ and has potential to spread awareness about issues that are very likely to become more common as benzodiazepam prescription rates continue to climb.

I read the review in a recent climbing magazine some months ago and it sounded really good.   I will post a review after I read it and share my thoughts on it as well.,Jul 2011,Apr 15 2013,0
6970,"Matt Samet's ""DEATH GRIP"" reviewed....",1,5," I have always enjoyed Matt's writing whether it was his humorous articles or shorter editorial pieces in Climbing and Rock and Ice.  Then I read ""Death Grip"" which delivers with the force of a Mike Tyson uppercut. It is a book that defies categorization while melding equal parts memoir~ autobiography~ confessional~ and a howling screed against the psychiatry-Big Pharma nexus that is now so thoroughly entrenched in industrialized societies around the world.    In movie terminology one could say ""Death Grip"" is Requiem for a Dream meets Front Range Freaks meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. How many drug addicts return from the living morgue of their addiction with a message of profound hope and a map of recovery for their fellow addicts? We don't need a number but we do know Matt is a revenant whose experience with Benzos is a tale that should be required reading for anyone considering pharmaceutically altering their brain-body chemistry. Embarking on that path is like leading off into one of Matt's 5.13 headpoints in the Flatirons; there should be no illusions as to the consequences if things go wrong.    For climbers who have struggled with recreational substance abuse~ caloric restriction~ over training~ monomania or Benzos~ ""Death Grip"" will provide a haunting and instructive journey.  Matt Samet has dug very deep to find the treasure beneath many layers of suffering and toil.",Oct 2011,Dec 1 2014,0

6979,Which bi- patterned rope?,1,5, climbing friend~   the sterling 9.8 it takes the abuse.   many falls and draggings over the rock for times you cannot flash.   It stays strong~ the sheath not even fuzzy after harsh beatings of many days~ punishing the naughty rope over the climbing rocks.   I have punished mine with more fallings than I very much like admit. It stays strong~ but perhaps is turning stiff in certain spots after much use~ making me fear the flash. however upon inspection there are no core shot or small concentrated soft or flat spots~ so I continue climbing high for flash on this sterling~ even though secretly afraid.   I also have strange friend utilizing grigri lowering with brake hand straight out~ which has perhaps caused the rope to run over the 90 degree corner flat end and turn into slight oval shape ... do you believe this is quite dangerous to not make flash on the oval rope with stiff spots and fall the big one? Shall I be quite afraid that some longer sections are stiff and other long sections more soft like warm spring mist near Bergen?,Jul 2014,Apr 6 2016,0

6987,Which bi- patterned rope?,1,13, I think they don't make bi-color due to the fact that they actually had to change the thread~ rather than just the pattern being woven~ so it created a weak point.   I've always been very happy spending the extra money on a bi-pattern and haven't had the issues noted above~ but of course that's an individual choice.

Great rope for ice a big alpine routes. I just picked up an Edelrid Topaz 9.2. Which like my PMI was rated as a single/double/twin rope. The sheath is thicker so it should hold up well.

Youll still deck if theres no knot in the system   Where they can be useful is for the belayer to let the climber know when its at the halfway mark for onsights and journeys into the unknown   Regardless the pattern change has to be VERY visible~ no dark coloured ropes   ;)",Mar 2009,Apr 7 2016,0

6995,Which bi- patterned rope?,2,0, I love my mammut Infinity 9.5mm for multipitch. It's dry treated with teflon~ which also reduces friction over the rock and through biners.

6996,Which bi- patterned rope?,2,1, Mattm~ you comments about ensuring appropriate contrast are quite valid.  My experience is with a high contrast bi-pattern rope.  My first experience was with a blue rope which changed one thread from red-green to just red or something similar.  It was hopeless~ and even more hopeless for me being red green colour blind. ,Jul 2012,Apr 7 2016,0

7001,Which bi- patterned rope?,2,6," After owning multiple bipattern ropes I tend to agree with mattm's stance:  I don't feel they are worth the additional cost. I use the Beal rope marking ink to mark the middle and both ends with nice broad bands (2"" at the ends and 4"" at the middle). When the rope is piled up I have a much easier time finding the middle and ends than locating the change in pattern and those shrink wrapped end caps (which fall off in a week anyway). I wash/rinse my rope fairly regularly and take that opportunity to touch up the ink markings if neede. This has been working great and frees up $ for other gear",Apr 2012,May 13 2016,0
7002,Which bi- patterned rope?,2,7, After using several bi-patterns and then going to a single pattern to save money~ I miss the bi-pattern.  But maybe it's just that my middle marker is shit.

7008,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,0, First~ full disclosure: My name is Tosch Roy~ I'm 25~ and after a rocky start on my way towards a mechanical engineering degree~ I dropped out of school to start a business called Free Range Equipment (circa 2012). We design and manufacture sport-specific backpacks for light and fast adventure in the mountains and sew everything together in Bend~ Oregon (not too far from Smith Rock so drop by if you swing through Bend!).    I want to know what features/characteristics turn your crank in a climbing pack for long multi-pitch routes. We are currently selling the Stud and would like to hear some thoughts and feedback on the product as well as ideas for a new model. ie. must have shoulder pad pockets~ gear loops~ big enough for a 30 rack of pabst~ etc. Super curious to hear what y'all have in mind!,Nov 2010,Nov 19 2015,0
7009,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,1, Gear loops on the hipbelt are rather nice.   For me it depends on size:  small daypack I just want very stripped down~ but with a hydro-sleeve and port for the hose.  maybe a daisy chain for clipping~ but pretty optional.     For multi-day fast and light alpine~ I've always hoped some company would come up with a pack that has an actual~ usable bivy pad as part of the frame system.  Like the equivalent of a 3/4 ridgerest built into the pad (but removable),Sep 2012,Nov 19 2015,0
7010,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,2, a biggger hole for the hydration tube. gear loops on the hip belt. a strap on the top so you can put a rope over the top of the pack so it wont slide down. compression straps that are long to hold a rope on the outside. basically a ski touring pack.,Jul 2012,Nov 19 2015,1
7011,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,3, I am looking for a hydration pack with gear loops built into the shoulder straps.  Similar to metoliusclimbing.com/big-wa… with a small waist strap for stability.  The metolius gear sling's compartment is way to small to be useful for anything.  I want a bladder for 2 liters of water~ room for a jacket (light shell or puffy)~ and some food (a few bars)~ and a headlamp.   I would also prefer a single/double zippered compartment design without any netting or exterior unzipped pockets to get caught on the rock.  A haul loop system is also needed.   Make the pack as light as possible so that I am willing to actually carry it to the base of the climb and use it on the climb.,Feb 2006,Nov 19 2015,0
7012,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,4, Having played with your pack in person~ I must say I really like it. The roll top style is great for big approaches where im going to walk in wearing shorts & T. So the pack will contain: Jaket~ pants~ long sleeve~ rack or rope~ food~ water bottle~ shoes and have room for no more. Keeps the bag small for the actual climbing. Id like to be able to get the bag small/for it to have side compression straps. Those straps are also great for carrying a coiled rope. Would be also nice to have materials extend from the roll top. More room for the hike~ less bag. Keep it up with the material. Bomber.    Another nice to have is two secure/reinforced handles. Great to dangle a bag off an anchor or off a sling clipped to my belay loop when going up a chimney.,Aug 2006,Nov 19 2015,0
7013,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,5, @AlexandreK & frank bonnevie: When you are wearing a harness with gear loops and a pack with gear loops on the waist belt~ do you use both sets of them? Or one or the other?   @climber pat: I hear ya on the size of the metolius big wall sling. There's room for either a bladder or a windbreaker and not a whole lot more. A 10L compartment would be money.   Love the feedback so far. Keep it coming.,Nov 2010,Nov 19 2015,0

7019,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,11, @Tosch:   If I have both a harness and pack with gear loops~ I'm usually using the gear loops on the pack if I'm trying to move fast with a partner and clean a pitch.  USually those gear loops are more accessible for cleaning/swapping gear over to a partner.  Also big bonus in alpine with you throw a layer on that starts covering your harness.,Sep 2012,Nov 20 2015,0
7020,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,12," I am a firm believer that KISS is always the way to go ( keep it simple stupid ). I have burned through many packs and lately have settled on four-five packs. I use a BD Bullet or BD 24 Axis for multi pitch rock~ BD Speed 30 for alpine and a Stubby haul bag for general rock play. I have a separate pack for ski days ( avi lung ). I choose all of these bags because there is no unneeded strap nonsense on any of them~ no bottle holders on any of them and they all except the Bullet have a rope carry over the top which is beyond awesome time and time again. Stronger sternum straps ( get rid of the stretchy nonsense so many of them have~ I want it tight~ not flexible. I can adjust myself ) and well padded shoulders without being too bulky are things that stand out to me. Alpine pursuits are when I find the hip belt gear loops helpful but thats about it. BD used to make a pack called the Predator ( i have two of them still ) and I always loved it. High denier count~ ski carry~ tool carry~ rope carry~ external crampon carry and a side access zipper on the 40+L options. This is still one of the best packs I ever owned because it was so multi functional. However~ it was usually too ""heavy"" and bulky to consider taking up a multi pitch. I have a lot of opinions regarding soft goods and their construction. I spend many days in the mountains in many disciplines and would be happy to offer a more in depth approach to what I personally see as a successful multi pitch pack.    Best of luck. I checked out your website and your products are at the very least~ pretty attractive looking. Im sure they're pretty bomber too but I have had zero experience with them. Ive actually never even heard the brand before. Looks like you've done well thus far!",Nov 2014,Nov 20 2015,0
7021,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,13," elasticized mesh pockets on both sides to hold food items for quick snacks without having to open the main pack.   Short'ish torso length and unintrusive hip-belt to avoid interfering with harness (I want my pack's hip-belt to sit above my harness).   Multiple torso lengths so for once all of us can find one that fits without overlapping the harness waist belt.   Lightweight and super-packable so it's easy to carry to a high camp inside of a larger backpack.   Somewhat tear resistant fabric on surfaces exposed to the rock (e.g. chimneying)~ though I realize this must be balanced with weight.   Very few other ""features"".  KISS.

7023,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,15, Having used the stud for two or three years now I can say it does everything I thought it was supposed to do. The thing only has one strap and it get used.  On approaches I normally have my rope~ helmet~ and sometimes an extra layer all clipped in.  It does also have a strong handle that I use to clip it into the anchor.  The pack is big enough to carry a double rack~ climbing shoes~ harness~ water~ food and nothing else. This is perfect if it is your backpack for the day and your partner has one as well but not quite big enough if it is your party's only pack.  This summer we used the stud as a party of two on a longer route~ 9ish pitches of demanding enough climbing that we didn't want to lead with the pack on.  Really the only sacrifice we made was hiking with our harnesses on and clipping shoes to them~ everything else went in the stud all day.  The only comment I heard about the pack all day was that it should have some compression straps on the side for clipping your jacket to and making it smaller when climbing. I think that is unnecessary.  Who the hell wants their only sweater dangling off the their backpack when you are a thousand feet up.  Also good luck bringing so little stuff on a big climb that you can even compress the thing~ it is small enough as it is.  The hip belt is great. The pack is too small to justify a hip belt large enough to put a loop on. Also since the length is short enough you can really cinch down all the straps~ hip~ sternum (I am with Jon Sullivan no elastic)~ and shoulders. This gets the pack high enough above your waist that there is no interference with the harness and therefore no need for extra loops.  Oh and also the current hydration bladder interface is great. Sometimes on long easy pitches I find myself snagging a drink on lead which is is a feature I never knew I would like or use. On a different note it would be hard to use the stud on some route where you need an axe for the approach~ no way to strap it on really.  Maybe their is another Free Range pack that fits that bill.   Sorry for the long winded response Tosch.  Tosch's packs are as bomber as they look and they really do it all....so get one.,Oct 2011,Nov 21 2015,0

7026,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,1,18," If you aren't doing a carryover with bivy gear then there isn't enough weight to need padding on the hip belt~ so don't worry about gear loops.  I'd much rather use the molded gear loops on my harness then fabric ones off my hip belt personally.  Aside from molded loops being easier to use the hip belt padding always gets in the way of a harness anyway~ make it high enough to clear and you won't be putting weight on your pelvis anyway.   You current pack looks great for one day longer climb~ I would add something to carry pointy bits.  Before someone complains~ yes some of us DO climb in the alpine and actually need to bring those things :)     Check out how BD did the speed tool carries~ that's been my favorite design.  One slot of fabric below for the pick~ a single strap clip to secure it (clipped under the fabric slot when not in use).  Then velcro straps that can be removed in seconds for the handle.  Leave that upper velcro looser and you can reach back one handed to unclip and retrieve your axe.  The whole back is still very clean when the carry isn't being used~ it's easy~ and doesn't add much weight.   Just four loops the right width for voile ski straps can take care of crampons~ again light and clean when not in use.   The other reason I say this is because honestly it's hard to beat the disposable ""are you a member"" pack for regular old multi-pitch~ they are so cheap that even if you kill one a season it's no big deal.  Where that pack really comes short though is that the daisy on the back is downright scary~ I wouldn't trust it with anything.

For multipitch rock I like to have one pack for the party carried by the second. I don't expect the pack to be hauled~ but at times it might be suspended from the harness for things like chimneying.

7032,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,2,3, Actually~ a pack that I already like very much is the Imlay Leprechaun:  Has a lot one would like in a multi-pitch pack.   Haul loop doesn't interfere with getting in the pack.  No exterior pockets and such to snag when trailing in a chimney.  Durable material.  Inner zip pocket.  Inner remove-able sit pad while remainder of pack can be a sit pad for a second.  Side straps can secure a relatively skinny rope.  Short enough to not interfere with gear loops on harness.   The mesh water vent in the bottom isn't necessary for my use.   Could be a little bigger for cold weather days or very long routes.  And it's a little heavier than many packs so my partner and I usually choose between her pack and mine based on how much trailing we think we'll do on a climb.   In short~ a little bigger and lighter but still durable would be nice. :-),Apr 2006,Nov 28 2015,0

7045,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,2,16, let me list   1. Around 20 liters   2. orange~ yellow or white the light color lets me see the inside of my pack.   2. 2 big burly grab handles/haul loops (Yellow is the best color)   3. urethane and wielded seams would be awesome~ if this cant be done taped seams would be all most as good.   4. Arc'teryx have nailed the closure system on the alpha fl just copy it ~ it's so damn good.   5. Some kind of ice axe attachment~ i was thinking something like this~  B= two fabric tunnels H= a big ass centralized haul loop   The idea is you put a little elastic cinch on the haul loop and use that to hold the spike end the more radically curved the tool is the more it should be forced into the tunnel (that's the theory) if using a basic straight shafted axe then you can put the adze in the other tunnel allowing a very secure carry. Nothing to catch providing the tunnel lies flush with the pack~ the elastic cinch can be removed when not in use.   6. Rope strap is a no brainer   7. No gear loops on the pack body or hip belt~ put them on the front shoulder strap instead.   8. Removable foam frame sheet (will be replaced with cut up thermarest)   9. I would like a vest like system similar to that on ultra marathon packs~ super stable design and allows for things like food to be kept up front.   10. Have a internal pocket built into the skirt of the cinch~ it should just be a rectangular pouch that could flip in and out of the pack allowing the pack to have a brain that's perfectly designed for inside the pack.   This is all i could think of right now though i'm sure i could think of more ways given enough time.,Oct 2015,Jan 11 2016,0

I still haven't gotten my hands on an arcteryx alpha fl pack. From what I've seen though~ I think arcteryx did a really good with that pack.

7049,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,3,0, Yeah ok. I haven't explored welded seams yet but the technique is definitely on the radar. Do you have a link to the hand held seam welder you're looking at? There's another company in town making ballast bags for wakeboard boats that has offered up their RF welder to experiment on. That would be pretty next level.   Speaking of~ if you're thinking of buying a seam welder~ are you working on any projects?   Do you have an arcteryx alpha fl pack? Do you like the simple suspension? Our big medicine pack has a suspension that's pretty similar to a golite jam which isn't far off the alpha fl. I think people who are used to full on internal frame might be wanting more support but~ like just about any frameless pack~ if you pack it well~ it's great.,Nov 2010,Feb 5 2016,0

7054,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,3,5, I just tossed my second favorite crag pack of all time~ or I'd upload some photos for you.  It was a Wild Country~ made from a fairly heavy ballistics cloth.  It lasted at least 15 years with me~ and I bought it used.  The features were:   - Easily haulable    - had a lid        -which had a zip pocket on the inside   - waist belt (which can be tucked into a horizontal pocket )   - side pockets (that were accessible via diagonal zippers~ about mid height.  They did not protrude out from the main body of the pack... Think slash pockets vs. cargo pockets)   - flexible removable plastic back frame   - three daisies~ two with axe loops at the bottom~ and one daisy up the center with a big loop at the top end for clipping a sling to for hauling My favorite crag pack of all time was an REI~ which I liked because it ACTUALLY FIT length wise.  It also had a top lid and  was a top loader. As someone else mentioned the REI pack had two long compression straps on each side which worked like a champ for tying on a rope.  With a waist belt it was better than my Wild Country for cross-country skiing and mountaineering~ but it would have been aced as a straight up climbing pack had my Wild Country been long enough to fit.  The good points of the REI:   - skiable length of pack (top at the shoulders~ very plain waist belt at the bottom which sets below the pelvic crests)   - narrow!   - compression straps   If you want a drawing of each pack~ I'll gladly send one~ as I doubt I can find pics of them on line.,Nov 2012,Feb 26 2016,0

7058,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,3,9, I would call the FL45 closer to 40L with a 10-15L extension collar. Without extending it~ I can get slightly more in it than my rolled top HMG Ice Pack 2400 (39L). I know the specs say it's 33-45L~ but I think they are being way too conservative. Similarly~ the FL30 specs say it's 23-30L~ but I'd call it 26L with a much smaller 5L collar.    I've barely used my 45~ but my FL30 has been used as my crag pack a few times a week since it was first available for sale. I've destroyed the shock cord and worn a few holes in the front near the bottom. I would say it's pretty average in durability~ but maybe above average relative to its weight.

Without the extension collar~ it closed comfortably with 36 liters of water in it. At 37 liters~ some came out the top when the main bag was pulled entirely shut. It was too hard to keep it stable for me to start filling the extension collar.   FWIW~ filled with water~ I noticed some drops of water beading on the outside of the upper seams.

7065,What do you want to see in a multi-pitch climbing pack?,3,16," Great thread~ I'm learning a lot!   I'm in software design~ and here we do a lot of user research. But we usually avoid asking users what features they want~ focusing instead on understanding what problem they need to solve. With this thinking we can perhaps find innovative solutions that the user was not aware of. So what problem should the pack solve? What usage modes do we have?   1. Getting a relatively heavy load~ including rope~ shoes~ etc~ comfortably to the base of the climb.    -> possible features: Large volume~ comfortable shoulder straps~ ability to put rope etc on outside~ stable design~ hip belt.   2. Getting a lighter load (extra clothes~ guidebook~ food~ water~ first aid kit) up the rock~ without interfering with the climbing.   -> Small volume~ few things that can snag~ minimal interference with harness and gear loops (rides high)   3. Accessing contents at belays quickly and without dropping things~ often with one hand.   -> Light colors~ easy to open and close~ practical way of hanging the pack off anchor~ hydration system~ opening oriented so things do not fall out.   4. Getting a small amount of vital stuff (car keys~ credit card~ wedding ring) up AND down without losing it.   -> Separate small compartment with attachment for keys.   5. Keeping things dry.   There are apparent contradictions~ like ""stability and volume"" for approach and ""compact and flexible"" for climbing. A pack like this needs to be a transformer!   On the whole~ I personally would focus on comfort (like nice wide shoulder straps)~ and practical use at belays (like letting me keep my camera separate from my musli bars~ so I don't drop the camera while gobbling crumbs).",May 2016,May 12 2016,0

7068,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,0," The purpose of this is to get a comprehensive~ real world review over time of how these things actually work. As such~ it will not include the marketing hype or specs (you can look all that up yourself)~ unless I can personally verify or reject it. I will update and bump here. I have the 0.1 through the 0.5. Initial thoughts   So far~ I have only been able to get out for a short few hours on some granite finger crack~ so my initial impressions are not very solid at the moment. and I can't say a thing about durability. I will be taking them through the ringer on a whole lot of granite this summer~ and will try to update as appropriate.   First~ let's get some less important stuff out of the way: Action: Very smooth. Definitely nicer than the aliens of any make. Maybe on par or a touch less smooth than the mastercams. I did notice that there is a click on the .1 sometimes due to the trigger termination shifting when pulled~ but that is a non-issue for me. Trigger stiffness-wise~ I think it's right on the money. The trigger is definitely stiffer for the smaller sizes~ but not as stiff as the c3s for sure. Ergonomics: Generally very pleasant (and obviously way better than aliens)~ but maybe not quite as nice as the mastercams. The trigger and thumb loop are both very well put together. The thumb pad could be a touch flatter~ instead of the strange raised bit in the middle (will get picture). Also of note that the two smallest ones are substantially shorter than the others. This makes the distance between thumb and trigger a bit more awkward~ but not really an issue. I suspect this was to counter possible flop in these sizes. But we are talking about some really nit-picky stuff here.   Now to the good stuff. Stem flexibility: These things are REALLY supple and flexible~ all the way up through the trigger beads. Not quite WC zero flexy~ but still a lot. Strangely~ I was surprised to find that there really isn't much or any ""flop~""~ even in the bigger sizes~ despite the flexibility of the wire. Can't say much about how well the flexibility impacts walking~ but a flexy stem on a 4 cam unit is a good combo. Head width: Holy shit these things are thin. Not much of a difference for the smallest sizes compared to aliens~ but there is a HUGE difference in the larger ones (.4 and up) along the lines of a full cam lobe difference compared to the equivalent c4. Assuming that these things last~ I would genuinely consider an x4 over a c4 in the larger sizes (0.4+) for this reason alone. No clue at all how these sizes compared to equivalent larger mastercams or aliens~ sorry. ""Fussiness"": Small cams are very finicky due to much smaller room for error and the increasing importance of the subtleties of the rock surface. As such~ this is probably the most important~ if worst defined~ category for me. The smallest sizes are surprisingly predictable and confidence inspiring. I found that they are substantially less finicky than a similarly sized c3 or alien. I suspect that this has to do with the asymmetric axle design~ which yields a touch of extra range~ allowing for a bit less required precision when picking out a size~ and potentially a bit more room for error. Note that I was fairly surprised by this~ and was not expecting that to be the case. More time and more rock is needed to see how much this is true. Questions for the future: Let's get this out of the way: I have not yet whipped on one. This will assuredly happen soon~ as I have a strong tendency to get in over my head. As with literally every cam out there~ they are going to hold in a good placement~ so telling you whether or not they held isn't going to tell you anything. The question is how well they hold in marginal placements. I suspect that aliens still have an edge here due to the soft metal~ but who knows. I almost certainly won't be able to give a definitive answer here~ but I'll try.   Durability is the absolute top open question right now. The problem with the very narrow heads is that it will only take a little bit of deformity (like~ say~ from a hard fall) to make them useless. We'll see what happens when I beat them up a bit. Summary and general thoughts: WAY more real-world testing is needed~ but I think BD did it. At least as nice as the mastercam in almost every way that matters. As with the mastercam vs. the alien~ there appears to be some tradeoffs between the x4 and the alien. Durability and ability to hold a fall in marginal placements will determine exactly where that line falls. Now to whip some shine off these things. . . Update #1:   OP delivers! Some follow-up: Rain/work/other have so far prevented climbing. This will be rectified this weekend. In the meantime~ I'm following up with some pictures and follow-up from discussion here.   1) As mentioned previously~ the x4s are prone to kinking where the stem meets the thumb loop. The next few pics will show why. Note that the below was achieved just by bending by hand~ and was easily reversible to be (mostly) straight again. This was NOT from actual falling or hanging.  Kinking x4s.   The issue is primarily with BD's stem/thumb loop interface. In aliens and mastercams~ this is achieved with a side-by-side cable swage. The (very minor) issue with this is that it leaves the stem off-center from the thumb loop. BD attempted to fix this a bit with a bit of metal work~ as seen below.  .3 BD x4~ stem/thumb loop interface.   While this is clever~ it has two problems:    Problem 1: The kinking. Oh god the kinking. You can see from the picture that the cable has room to move leftward~ and it does. And it gets stuck there. You can easily bend it back~ but it's kinda silly to have in the first place. Comparison with mastercam:  Stem/thumb loop interface~ mastercam vs. x4   This likely could have been solved had BD not left a huge empty gap~ and had the stem fixed at the thumb loop termination. Seems like a bit of filler solder would have worked wonders there. Construction-wise~ looks like cable is soldered instead of swaged~ and there may be a technical reason why this can't be done with the head design. Someone with more experience with this stuff should chime in here~ cause I am talking directly out of my ass.   It should be noted that I did not find that this interfered with the trigger pull in any way~ since the entire trigger assembly is above the kink point.   Problem 2:~ for the smaller sizes~ there isn't enough room to keep the cable centered~ as seen below. I don't really know why they had to make the thumb loop thinner for the smaller sizes~ but they did.  BD .2 x4 stem/thumb loop interface   Next up:  the thumb itself. Mastercam seems to have an edge here too. The mastercam's thumb spot is wider and flatter and lacks that weird center ridge. Picture illustrates what I mean   Mastercam on top~ x4 on bottom.   As far as I am concerned~ the thumb loop is better in the mastercam in pretty much every way. The centering piece on the x4s makes them prone to kink and doesn't do anything at all in the large sizes. It remains to be seen how permanent those kinks might be. This is a potential durability issue~ and I'm a little disappointed.   But wait~ that's not all. Time to compared the tops in the next post. Update #2:   A few more comparisons below:   Length:  Ladies~ take note.   The x4s have two lengths~ with the smallest two sizes being much shorter than the rest. Note that the biggest sizes are significantly longer than their c4 counterpart.   Head width:   Let's start with the good stuff. The x4 heads are WAY thinner than the c4's. Yes~ those are the same exact sized cams in x4 and c4. Crazy.  c4 vs. x4 head widths   Unsurprisingly~ c3 still wins in the narrowest head department.  c3 vs x4 head width   Slightly surprisingly~ the x4's head appears to be a touch wider than a similar mastercam. The trade-off is that the x4 has substantially more metal on the rock.  mastercam vs x4 head width Update #3:   Got to climb a fair bit this weekend~ took a few whippers on the .5. The first time was placed a touch too widely~ and then a few times in a textbook placement after adjusting it a bit. Nothing terribly exciting happened (i.e. it held~ just like it's made to). Again~ the only interesting info is how well they hold better in marginal placements~ so nothing new learned here.   Worth noting that no kinking occurred as a result of a fall. I wouldn't really expect it to~ since the thumb loop and stem are directly in line in a fall. The stem has to bend in a different direction to the thumb loop assembly in order for the cable to be kinked~ so this is only likely to occur if loaded oddly. Might be more of an issue for aid climbers?   Also worth noting that~ like mastercams and aliens~ placing the x4s takes a bit more finesse than c4s~ in part due to the stiffness of the cable. Example: placing from a hard layback~ I could reliably blindly place a small c4 in a place where I know it will fit~ partially because you get a bit of feedback to your hand through the stem. Same placement with an x4 takes a bit more effort. Nothing big~ and nothing unexpected. Update #4:   Credit to Neil Pence and John Wilder for pointing out the difference between the pre-production and production swages.  Pre-production x4 swage. Note that this is VERY different than the production version.   You can clearly see that the pre-production version lacks the ""trough"" which is causing all the kinking issues.   So now this begs the question: what gives BD? Kinda seems like you dropped the ball here. Cost skimping? Difficult to manufacture in large quantities?   For now~ I will go ahead and say that my current recommendation is to wait to purchase these at this time until this is addressed. It seems like BD could have made the swages the right way~ and chose not to. I am going to keep climbing on mine (and happily~ I might add)~ but this really is a bit ridiculous. Final thoughts:   These have now been with me for a few months and have been put through a fair amount of beating in North Conway and Squamish granite. They’ve all taken falls (and held just fine~ thank you very much). I think it’s fair to say that I have a good sense of their durability and overall performance by now~ enough so that I can probably call this a final review. The following is simply going to be final thoughts~ confirmation~ or correction of previous statements~ with some additional durability info thrown in.   I’ll cut to the chase and give you the bottom line. Are these the “best” general use small cam out there right now? Answer: Sure~ by a bit~ probably.   This isn’t a satisfying or very specific answer~ but that’s the way it goes. These are DAMN nice cams. They stack up really nicely against anything and everything else out there. They do basically everything very well. The reality is~ though~ that if I already had a set of either of either aliens/basics or mastercams I’d probably be about as happy. Performance:   All of what has been said previously is still true. They are easy to use~ reliable~ and predictable. I don’t really have much to add. My partners and I have fallen on all 5 now~ and have not popped. Unfortunately~ I can’t generalize or compare to other cams had they been in the same placements~ but you can at least take that to mean that they don’t explode~ so that’s nice to know. The flexible stem is great~ as is the trigger sheath. What you see is what you get.   As mentioned earlier~ the larger sizes are surprisingly nice. The choices get a little clearer here against aliens and master cams~ as the double axle is a very nice feature. Against the c4s~ personally~ I have one of both of .4 and .5~ and I wouldn’t change that for the world. The x4s have narrower heads and a more flexible stem~ but the c4s are easier to place and just have that bomber feeling. No clue which I would choose if I could only have one.   Warning~ speculation ahead: There may actually be something to the stacked axle thing. It’s not that the cams will place substantially differently. It’s simply that there is an increased tolerance once placed compared to a single axle design. Small cams are sketchy~ almost always. This gives a touch bigger margin of error. Aliens increase their tolerance with soft metal at the cost of durability~ but the x4s don’t have to compromise to achieve something similar. Again~ this is speculation~ but I am fairly convinced that if there is one single reason to get the x4s~ it is this additional margin of error. Durability:   After some heavy use~ I can say that the kinking at the thumb loop swage is mildly annoying~ but not a big issue. It doesn’t really happen very much on its own~ even when fallen on. I could see it happening more with weird deep placements in horizontals~ but I never really encountered that. I do~ however~ now have a perma-kink at the head of the blue one (picture pending) from a fall when placed perpendicularly to the wall (i.e. not in the direction of fall). I also have this head kink on my offset mastercams from similar situations~ so no real comparative difference.   I never noticed any substantial binding of the trigger due to dirt/sand/grit~ but I was using these on mostly clean granite. Maybe people climbing in sandier or dirtier areas might have a better idea.   There was a bit of discussion in this thread about the potential for minor lobe mushrooming to result in the lobes rubbing against each other due to the tight tolerances between lobes. While I’ve experienced this quite a bit with aliens (one of the reasons I don’t have any)~ I did not notice this at all with the x4s. The easy explanation is that the soft metal on the aliens is more likely to deform compared to x4s. Mastercams don’t have this issue~ as the lobes don’t really come in contact with each other.   Overall~ the mastercams still win in the durability category~ just a hair ahead of the x4s due largely to the minor stem tweaking issue. Aliens are last by a long shot~ as you can effectively destroy one in one fall. Value:   Totem basics~ mastercams~ and the x4s all clock in at $70 retail. Fixe Aliens come in $10 more expensive~ c3s $10 less. There is a bit of extra built-in value for the x4s if you consider that fewer cams make up a slightly larger range. I personally prefer the x4s over both the mastercams and the aliens at this point~ so the value judgment is a bit of a no brainer to me~ but this comes down to personal preference.   And that's all~ folks. Final final thoughts:   In the long run~ I think the x4 are just ""meh."" Given a choice between having mastercams and x4s~ I think I would probably have to give the slight long run upper hand to the mastercams. The reasons for this are mostly gut feeling. I just find myself a bit happier placing a mastercam than an x4 in a place where both would work.   Over the past year or so~ the x4s have proven themselves to be a bit delicate for my tastes. While the kinking at the thumb loop did not turn out to be a real problem~ other things did. The heads got kinked fairly easily and frequently. When the heads got kinked even a little~ the trigger pull action worsened dramatically. Take a fall on one of these in a weird placement~ and it could instantly become a pain to clean~ and once cleaned~ required hand tweaking. All that bending back and forth might have some super long run metal fatigue issues~ but I'll let an engineer who knows better give judgment here.   Kinking is just not a big issue with the mastercams I have~ as they have both beefier cables (which don't tweak as easily) and a trigger system which is apparently a bit more robust (or at least that's my gut). On the other hand~ the thin (and somewhat delicate) cable allows the x4s to have excellent stem flexibility. While theoretically this could reduce walking or enable weird placements~ I have found the difference in walking to be negligible~ but others might not.   The sizes that shine in the x4s are definitely .2 and .3 (.1 is just scary small no matter what). The larger sizes (especially the .5 and up) often a pain to place compared with their c4s brethren. When going with a single rack~ I defaulted to the c4s for the .5 100% of the time~ and the .4 c4 vs x4 was a coin flip. Again it's a tradeoff. The x4s give much narrower heads for weird pockets. The c4s are easier to place~ easier to clean~ and give more happy bomber placement feelings. The big benefit of the x4s is that they do noticeably cover a bigger range per cam compared with either mastercams~ which comes at the cost of the daintiness discussed.   In the end~ I am fairly happy with what I have~ but would be equally happy with a rack of mastercams in the same sizes. If I were in the market~ it would really come down to whatever set I could get for a better deal. With the updated aliens coming around the corner~ who knows if there really is a ""best"" small cam out there.",Aug 2010,Jun 5 2013,1

7070,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,2," Going to have to disagree with you on the action and ergonomics (in favor of the x4's). TLDR; much better than the mastercams.   Action - Smoother than the mastercams~ but the totem aliens I would say are the only small cam that can touch the X4's.  Where it seems like the mastercams kind of/ subtly  ""pop"" off from their resting position~ versus the X4's and totems have a smooth gradient of pull.    Ergonomics - This is one place BD kicks everyone to the curb on~ they are much better than the mastercams.   The surface treatment of the mastercams trigger do nothing to help your finger locate or stay on the surface of the trigger bar you need to pull on. The X4's use subtle surface breaks and changes to help your fingers locate and stay on the trigger bar. Even without the cutout in the trigger bar just the curving concave surface on the to of the trigger makes it a better design.    Also~ why do you think the surface you put your thumb on should be flatter? (an honest question). Because the curvature and surface breaks created by the ribbing versus a smoother flatter (or even a texture flatter) design would be less ergonomic in the context of a cam.

7071,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,3," Hi shoo~ thanks for the review.     Regarding the action~ yeah~ I feel that mastercams have a lot of initial force to overcome before it starts to retract~ retracts the rest of the way with much less force after (as NorCalNomad   described as the pop off the initial position).  Some people don't like this~ but I like the tightness of the spring.   I am interested in your ""Stem Flexibility"" compared to the Aliens because I've never tried the WC zeros.  I know Mastercams was a great substitute/filled the void of the Alien hiatus~ but Mastercams are not as flexible as Aliens.

7073,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,5, I am really liking the X4s so far.  I climbed some granite multipitch and they didn't disappoint.  I got to try them in Eldo on Sunday and I got on a few pitches that I felt in the past were made much safer by having C3s due to the narrow placement.  X4s went right in but sometimes had to work a little harder due to the flexible cable compared to a C3 that you can slot due to the double stem.  Still worth it with no walking or moving due to the flexible cable and the armored sheath is pretty slick~ I think it will take the abuse.  Can't wait to place them more!,Jul 2007,Jun 5 2013,0

7079,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,11, So far I really like the X4's and I don't regret my decision to buy a set of them (I got a great deal). My initial impressions of the X4 are as Shoo's review said. Action is generally very smooth~ and the trigger action is not too stiff but not too loose. I used these guys in Eldo~ and the small head size came in handy~ and I thought the placements were easy to make without much fiddling. I've used these in Eldo and Boulder Canyon.    That being said~ I did manage to bend one--I didn't fall on it~ so I think this might be from being placed over a rock edge?  I've only climbed on them 2-3 times~ and I'm a little surprised that it did this so easily.    After bending it~ the trigger action is not nearly as smooth and it's bent in such a way that I can only pull the heads down if I pull the trigger unevenly (which makes it worse). I've tried to bend it back into shape but no luck. The weakness is at the insertion of the wire in the the base of the cam. I'm not sure if this is a one-time event~ a defective cam~ or that all of them will eventually do this if I fall on them.  Anyone else have this experience? If you have any suggestions as what to do to fix it~ or if it's worth letting BD know~ let me know.   Bent X4   trigger action with bent x4 ,Mar 2012,Jun 6 2013,0

7081,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,13, I bent the stem on one of mine doing a wandering route in Yosemite. I bent it back. No issues~ smooth as new.   Mine bent at the swage. How hard are you bending it back?   Really dig em. They kinda handle like larger versions of WC Zeroes~ which are the tits for free stuff.   Have not aided on them yet~ but I'd imagine they're like MC's but with better flexibility since they lack the two trigger cables.   Random photo. ,Feb 2010,Jun 11 2013,0
7082,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,14, Don't drink the cool aid just yet.    The head is not as stable as the c4 and the stem is much stiffer than an alien~ so they walk. Sometimes you want a bigger headed cam bc more surface area contact for stability. When you have a small headed cam you don't want the rope pulling the cam around so the flexible stem is key.  The aliens also just sit better (differant camming angle?) and don't move at all once set. The x4 does not inspire the same confidence. The x4s are not as good as c4s or aliens for each cam's intended placements. Maybe the small x4 is better than a c3 I haven't tried red x4 yet.,Aug 2012,Jun 11 2013,0
7083,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,15, mattc81: While you are correct that there is a stability trade-off when you make the heads narrower~ you are incorrect that the stems are noticeably stiffer than aliens. In fact~ the reverse is probably true for at least a few sizes (hard to tell for sure)~ and both aliens and x4s are WAY more flexible than the c4s.   Going to do a bit of an update this afternoon. Sadly~ couldn't climb this past weekend~ but definitely will this weekend.   Anyone have anything specific they want to see? Currently on the agenda for this afternoon:   1) Head comparison pics with offset mastercams and c3s.   2) Swage termination pics. I think there may actually be something to the idea that these are more prone to kinking due to the unusual swage structure. Will have more details in a bit.   3) Some very unscientific observations about walking~ comparing with c3s and c4s. Would do mastercams~ but only have offsets~ and have no aliens on hand.,Aug 2010,Jun 12 2013,0
7084,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,16, Not to bash mastercams~ because I love them~ especially in the orange and yellow sizes~ but the way the two wires are oriented off the trigger so that they torque when loaded in horizontal placements has always bugged me.     Maybe Metolius had an excellent reason for designing them like this~ as opposed to rotating the two wires 90 degrees.   Anyway~ I think this is one area that perhaps will shine for the X4s over the Mastercams much like Aliens already do.  A comparison picture of a weighted (offset) Mastercam in a horizontal placement vs. one of a weighted X4 in a horizontal placement should show exactly what I'm referring to.     I know it's hard to get offsets to place correctly horizontally because they work best in small flares and pin scars~ but if you could get a comparison pic that would be cool.  Since you asked.  Thanks for offering.,Jul 2011,Jun 12 2013,0
7085,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,17, Jake: At the moment~ offset x4s don't exist (outside BD~ anyway)~ so I can't really do much with that. However~ when I get some pics up~ you'll see that the swage on the x4s is only semi symmetrical. However~ this is what may make them more prone to kinking~ as described above.,Aug 2010,Jun 12 2013,0
7086,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,18, That's not really what I meant.  I was referring to the two pull cables attached to the trigger on the Mastercams that rub and twist when the Mastercam is placed in a horizontal orientation and loaded.  Aliens and X4s don't have that issue because of the different design- which also makes them more flexible.  Sorry for the confusion.,Jul 2011,Jun 12 2013,0

7096,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),2,7, OP delivers! Some follow-up: Rain/work/other have so far prevented climbing. This will be rectified this weekend. In the meantime~ I'm following up with some pictures and follow-up from discussion here.   1) As mentioned previously~ the x4s are prone to kinking where the stem meets the thumb loop. The next few pics will show why. Note that the below was achieved just by bending by hand~ and was easily reversible to be (mostly) straight again. This was NOT from actual falling or hanging.  Kinking x4s.   The issue is primarily with BD's stem/thumb loop interface. In aliens and mastercams~ this is achieved with a side-by-side cable swage. The (very minor) issue with this is that it leaves the stem off-center from the thumb loop. BD attempted to fix this a bit with a bit of metal work~ as seen below.  .3 BD x4~ stem/thumb loop interface.   While this is clever~ it has two problems:    Problem 1: The kinking. Oh god the kinking. You can see from the picture that the cable has room to move leftward~ and it does. And it gets stuck there. You can easily bend it back~ but it's kinda silly to have in the first place. Comparison with mastercam:  Stem/thumb loop interface~ mastercam vs. x4   This likely could have been solved had BD not left a huge empty gap~ and had the stem fixed at the thumb loop termination. Seems like a bit of filler solder would have worked wonders there. Construction-wise~ looks like cable is soldered instead of swaged~ and there may be a technical reason why this can't be done with the head design. Someone with more experience with this stuff should chime in here~ cause I am talking directly out of my ass.   It should be noted that I did not find that this interfered with the trigger pull in any way~ since the entire trigger assembly is above the kink point.   Problem 2:~ for the smaller sizes~ there isn't enough room to keep the cable centered~ as seen below. I don't really know why they had to make the thumb loop thinner for the smaller sizes~ but they did.  BD .2 x4 stem/thumb loop interface   Next up:  the thumb itself. Mastercam seems to have an edge here too. The mastercam's thumb spot is wider and flatter and lacks that weird center ridge. Picture illustrates what I mean   Mastercam on top~ x4 on bottom.   As far as I am concerned~ the thumb loop is better in the mastercam in pretty much every way. The centering piece on the x4s makes them prone to kink and doesn't do anything at all in the large sizes. It remains to be seen how permanent those kinks might be. This is a potential durability issue~ and I'm a little disappointed.   But wait~ that's not all. Time to compared the tops in the next post.,Aug 2010,Jun 13 2013,0
7097,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),2,8, Were you placing and weighting all those pieces? Did you try to bend it back into place?   Also~ thanks for the detailed review! Great Info.,Mar 2012,Jun 13 2013,0

7102,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),2,13, A few more comparisons below:   Length:  Ladies~ take note.   The x4s have two lengths~ with the smallest two sizes being much shorter than the rest. Note that the biggest sizes are significantly longer than their c4 counterpart.   Head width:   Let's start with the good stuff. The x4 heads are WAY thinner than the c4's. Yes~ those are the same exact sized cams in x4 and c4. Crazy.  c4 vs. x4 head widths   Unsurprisingly~ c3 still wins in the narrowest head department.  c3 vs x4 head width   Slightly surprisingly~ the x4's head appears to be a touch wider than a similar mastercam. The trade-off is that the x4 has substantially more metal on the rock.  mastercam vs x4 head width,Aug 2010,Jun 13 2013,0

I know there are a lot of opinions on this thead~ but I guess I'm hoping for a cut n dry opinion please.    I'm leaning towards the BD~ but cant find the X4 anywhere.

7107,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),2,18, Quicky update from the weekend:   Got to climb a fair bit this weekend~ took a few whippers on the .5. The first time was placed a touch too widely~ and then a few times in a textbook placement after adjusting it a bit. Nothing terribly exciting happened (i.e. it held~ just like it's made to). Again~ the only interesting info is how well they hold better in marginal placements~ so nothing new learned here.   Worth noting that no kinking occurred as a result of a fall. I wouldn't really expect it to~ since the thumb loop and stem are directly in line in a fall. The stem has to bend in a different direction to the thumb loop assembly in order for the cable to be kinked~ so this is only likely to occur if loaded oddly. Might be more of an issue for aid climbers?   Also worth noting that~ like mastercams and aliens~ placing the x4s takes a bit more finesse than c4s~ in part due to the stiffness of the cable. Example: placing from a hard layback~ I could reliably blindly place a small c4 in a place where I know it will fit~ partially because you get a bit of feedback to your hand through the stem. Same placement with an x4 takes a bit more effort. Nothing big~ and nothing unexpected.,Aug 2010,Jun 17 2013,0
7108,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),2,19, I finally got to play (in the store) with a Blue X4 the other day.  I had my green and yellow Totem Basic cams (aka improved Aliens) to compare to.  Here are some observations.   First off~ let me be clear about one thing~ because I keep noticing a lot of confusion about this from many people: Totem Basics/Aliens are NOT the same as the Fixe models: the Fixe Alien is an exact copy of the CCH design; Totem on the other hand made a few minor but very valuable improvements to the design~ the most important of which is reducing the bulk of the axle end piece~ which reduced head width by a few mms.  I also find the Totems to be better made that the Fixe and to operate more smoothly.  And~ the Totem units were $20 cheaper than the Fixe~ but are now going up in price by $10~ which BTW will put them at the same price point as the X4.   Now for my impressions when comparing the BD X4 with the Totem Basics (let me emphasize again: NOT the Fixe Aliens): ,Oct 2004,Jun 18 2013,0
7109,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),3,0, I bout e .75 size before a trip to RMNP this weekend. Overall~ I'm incredibly impressed. Smooth action on the trigger and nice narrow head width. My girlfriend pointed out to me that the longer stem made it easier for her to get to the trigger when cleaning the cam. However~ I'm reserving my opinion until I get the .1 size~ I hardly ever take my 00 Master Cam with me while climbing because I find the range to be nearly useless while free climbing. But looking at the .1 at Neptune Mountaineering~ I think I could actually make that a key component to my rack.,Jun 2013,Jun 25 2013,0

7118,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),3,9, These stems should not kink that easily.  There must be something off with the quality of the cable BD uses.

7126,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),3,17," So after dealing with the black diamond operator robot on the phone I have awnsers!!!   So the trough drilled into the shroud(housing) which incases the swage is there for...   Once the swage is installed it is incased in the housing and they had to be able to inspect the swage after the housing was installed to ensure proper installation. Which iw shy the whole is there to allow visibility . The person i spoke with said that he understood there was a small trade-off as far as the symetry goes but he said after a few meetings the agreed on the small trade-off. The reason the mock-ups dont have it im assumeing is because they were probably harder to inspect not a problem when inspecting 40 but is a serious problem when inspecting 4000. The recess or trough enabled bd to more quickly and more cost effectively make these cams. All in all its not a big deal anyways maybe a nuissance on rare occasion but its still a great product. Also unlike plastic due to the design and weave pattern on these cables thinking that the cable will fatigue due to bending might happen is not ""IMO"" a concern. Since thes cables arent bending that far it would most definately take millions of cycles for any slight decrease in strength to occur. Now on the other hand if you could bend it at lets say a 120 degree angle it might be more of a problem. Also the only reason these cables even bend is just due to slight friction in between the individual strands in the cable not serious bending.   Hope this awnsers alot of questions !",Mar 2013,Jul 8 2013,0
7127,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),3,18," I was just at Neptune yesterday and played with the 0.75"" X4.  I only had to trigger it two or three times for it to take a 10-15 degree kink... I agree this will most likely only have cosmetic & convenience consequences and not be a safety risk.  But come on!  How was this overlooked?  Once the kink is set~ the triggering action becomes a bit unstable (tendency for the stem to buckle while pulling the trigger). And~ BTW~ John W.~ Aliens DO NOT do this.  I've used them for 15+ years (CCHs and Totems) and have never noticed any tendency for this behavior at all.",Oct 2004,Jul 8 2013,0
7128,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),3,19, To be clear~ the problem is the kinking~ not the lack of symmetry. I would be happier if they didn't bother with the symmetrical thing at all. It seems as though they made a trade-off without understanding the side effects of their design choice.   My opinion does not change after hearing from Neal's report. This is issue simply should not exist. The product is rushed. I hope they fix it in future batches. If I were in the market today~ I would probably hold off a bit and/or look more favorably on competitor's options.,Aug 2010,Jul 8 2013,0
7129,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),4,0, That's pretty much in line with what I expected- production decision based on being able to produce the X4 efficiently.   Eric- You can easily bend the Alien at the same point- its because of how they are swaged. My guess is its more pronounced in the X4 due to how sturdy the rest of the unit is compared to the Alien. This is also why it seems to be a problem for some users with the trigger pull- but I could not kink the X4s in the shop very easily and the aliens kinked very easily.,unknown,Jul 8 2013,0

7131,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),4,2, Just took a close look at mine (.1-.4)  The trough is there but NONE of my cables get stuck in it in any way.  I gave them a healthy bend into the gap and there wasn't even a chance they would get stuck.     Are we talking about the cables getting hung up or the cable itself bending at/near the swage. ?  If it's simply a kinking issue it's no different than Totem Basics~ Mastercams etc.  If I bend those (by hand) at the swage they kink too.  Even my 11 year old CCH Aliens can be kinked by hand no--problem.     Feeling like this is a non-issue...,Jun 2006,Jul 8 2013,0
7132,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),4,3, Sure~ Aliens (or any other cam~ for that matter) can be kinked.  That's not the question.     The issue is that X4s get kinked for no good reason~ as a result of trigger pull~ for example~ or (I assume) as a result of packing~ normal handling~ etc.  And NO~ Aliens DO NOT do that.  They have not done that in the 15 years I have used them multiple times a week (both CCH and Totem).   From my very limited in-store experience~ it is not the cable getting stuck anywhere~ but the cable actually bending.,Oct 2004,Jul 9 2013,0

He is comparing smaller x4s to larger competitors~ and already the x4s are slightly wider.

I always thought mastercam cables were a bit too stiff and the cable on the X4s seems perfectly flexible.   I've also found the gray size is frequently used - it is between the yellow and orange mastercam and gets placed ALOT.  Before I tended to have tipped out yellow mastercams in these placements.   I carry double #0.75 and #0.5 camalots and replaced one set of them with the X4 version of those sizes and they're like butter in placements. Love 'em.   So +1 from this guy.,Jan 2001,Aug 9 2013,0

7164,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),5,15," After minimal usage~ I already have a bunch of minor niggles with the X4s:   1) The expansion range is not exactly as advertised.   .2 X4: 9.9 - 16.5 mm   0 C3: 10.7 - 15.8 mm   According to specs~ the yellow X4 should fully cover the range (and lower!) of the green C3.  In reality~ a fully retracted .2 is a touch larger than a fully retracted green C3~ maybe by a millimeter.  This is still good enough for me to consider the .2 and .3 to be (pretty much) covering the whole expansion range of the top 3 C3s (0-2).   2) The weight is not exactly as advertised.  (For neurotic gram-counters)   size | weight(g) | measured   0.2 | 54 | 63.1   0.3 | 75 | 84.3   0.4 | 82 | 89.4   0.5 | 91 | 97.5   I have two .2s and two .3s that weigh the same.  The difference over specs is ~10%.  Not a big deal~ but not perfect.   3) The .75 is a bit floppy for my liking~ so I chose not to pick it up.  I thought it might become worse over time but this is conjecture.  This one is purely subjective preference.   4) In addition to stem kinking~ there is a bit of... curve or misalignment developing between the trigger bar and cam head over the armored cable beads (after only a couple days of use!).  Not a big deal~ but not perfect.  cable beads losing shape   5) On both my .3s~ the trigger pull became rather gritty and sticky after accidental contact with dirt.  I didn't expect this to happen so quickly~ on my first trip out.  It might be that the open hollow lobes housing the springs trap debris more easily than typical.  A couple applications of metolius cam lube and washing under running water took care of it fine.  Not a big deal~ but something to watch.  This has never happened with my C4s.   6) The smaller X4s (.1-.3) have a slightly wider head than the larger ones (.4-.75).   Isn't the purpose of the internal springs supposed to be for narrow head width?  There does not seem to be a point to this design feature when the X4s without internal springs are narrower.  head width: .2 and .3  head width: .2 and .5   7) The lobes taper on the larger X4s (.4-.75)~ and are quite narrow for some parts of the expansion range.  Not confidence-inspiring.  X4 lobes: outside range is ~2/3 the width of C4 lobes  .5 C4 next to retracted .5 X4: the X4 lobes are the same width as the C4 only for the smallest third of the expansion range   8) The C4s still somehow feel better.  The trigger pull feels stiffer (and maybe a little shorter) on the X4s and that might have something to do with it.  Like shoo said above~ the C4s just have that bomber feeling.  I find the X4s less so. That being said~ I still prefer X4s over all other small cams.  I would recommend getting the .2~ .3~ and .4 and sticking with C4s above.  Here are some things I particularly like about the X4s:   1) Expansion range is good.  For me~ the range increase over master cams (especially that crappy orange) is noticeable and makes the X4s easier to place.  I also replaced C3s 0-2 with these and am comfortable with it.   2) Consistency with C4s (color-coding~ good size-overlaps)   3) Less bulk hanging on the harness than C3s and C4s   4) Slightly longer slings than C4s   5) NOT doubled extendable slings   6) Polish and overall ""production value"" ... these things look the part.",Dec 2011,Sep 13 2013,0

7166,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),5,17," I have the .4 X4~ and also agree that the way the trigger ""wires"" are attached is odd. This results in a cam that retracts VERY smoothly for the first 80% of the pull~ and gets to be a pain in the ass for the last 20% (and pretty much impossible for the last 10% of the range).    I expected the .4 X4 to be able to fully cover the range of a yellow mastercam~ but it can't due to this ""issue.""   That said~ if I wanted something more flexible than a mastercam~ I'd take a WC Zero or Alien in this range before the X4. The double axle X4's just aren't living up to my expectations.

7167,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),5,18," Looks like mine had too much glue used on the nylon ""wires"" which caused opposite lobes to interfere with each other. I grabbed a screwdriver and scrapped the excess glue off~ and the cam now retracts comfortably though about 95% of its range.   The issue was the nylon wouldn't rotate like a wire and the glue was holding the nylon at a constant angle coming out of the cam lobe. Tough to describe~ but I imagine that the cam will get better retracting with use.",Nov 2011,Oct 6 2013,0

7169,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),6,0, For what it's worth~ while this isn't an issue on mine~ I could see how this could happen. There is a touch too much glue on one of mine also. If there was a little more~ it could restrict the trigger pull a bit. On mine~ I can pull the trigger such that the lobes are basically entirely~ with just a very~ very small amount left over if I manually squeeze the lobes together. This is also the case with my mastercams and some c4s.   Unless the glue job is really bad (and it sounds like it is for some)~ I don't really see a general issue. That last bit of pull puts you way into overcammed territory anyway~ so it isn't really usable range. Plus~ you can use that bit of range if you're desperate just from shoving the cam in~ but risk getting it stuck.   That being said~ there is no glue spillover whatsoever on my mastercams~ while there is some on my x4s. I suppose you could add that as points to the mastercams just being an overall better constructed and more durable unit~ but lacking the (frankly very useful) additional range of the x4s.,Aug 2010,Oct 7 2013,0
7170,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),6,1, The failure to be able to get the lobes anywhere near fully retracted is a real problem.  I have one X4 so far (a .4) and the lobes rotate maybe 60 degrees at most.  That extra bit at the end is useful when you need to get the unit out of a real tight placement~ and this particular example is a dismal failure in that respect.  I predict we'll see these things stuck frequently~ albeit with the lobes well short of totally rotated.,Jul 2009,Oct 7 2013,0

I'm wondering if its the nylon trigger wires hitting each other like it was on mine...   Anyways~ my #2 Yellow C3 gets stuck for that reason ALL of the time.

7173,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),6,4, I too had issues with my .4 x4 not fully retracting.  As others have been saying~ the issue has to do with the Kevlar trigger cords and an excess of glue. The sloppy glue job made the cords inflexible at their attachment to the lobes~ making it impossible to fully retract the unit. I scraped the excess glue off the attachment point and aggressively flexed the Kevlar trigger cords around until they had softened up~ and voila~ the cam retracts just like it should.    So if any of you are having issues with your dual axle x4s~ try removing the excess glue and softening that part of the Kevlar trigger cords~ it worked wonders on my .4 at least.,Apr 2012,Oct 8 2013,0

I cant show the problem at its worst~ maybe somone else has a picture? Here's a picture to show what I'm talking about   I scrapped off most of the glue but theres still a bit left here.

The .5 is now my favorite cam on my entire rack. We whipped all over that thing last month and it worked like a charm. The real reason it is my favorite is because after heavy use you really see how that more narrow head makes it such a crucial piece.

7195,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),7,6, Ok I did read the whole thread and you didn't answer my question or clarify your logic in regards to it. Just because it's harder to retract the lobes via the trigger around their max retraction doesn't mean the cam will walk less when placed in that range. True their are many factors that play into a cams ability (or inability) to walk but unless you are suggesting the actual spring tension is much greater around this range of max retraction~ I don't think the issue being discussed affects the cam's walking ability.,Apr 2002,Nov 14 2013,0

7208,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),7,19, I had the .75 X4 for a while and liked it but felt like it was a little stickier than my regular .75 C4. I still loved the flexible stem and ended up ordering a whole set.    It just so happened that I jumped on to this thread right when I got them. It's true~ my .4 was horrible and .5 was pretty bad. The .75 had minor glue retraction issues.   The .3 and .2? Great~ place them a lot and no worries with the metal cables.   I contacted Black Diamond about an exchange for my X4's and concern about the problem. I hadn't even removed the tags from my .4 and .5 yet. No response after a full week of waiting.

I just really didn't like the feel of the Fixe/CCH Alien in my hand. The Mastercam has a worse expansion range. The only other micro cam I'd consider at this point is the Totem Basic.

7219,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),8,10," The kinking is caused by the ""cosmetic"" piece placed over the swage.  Doesn't bother me a bit.  It's minor~ and I don't see it as a problem.  It's a minor offset of one or two degrees (on mine) and after using them~ I honestly don't see it as an issue.  What's more of an issue is the way the kevlar is glued on the three bigger sizes (as has been mentioned earlier upthread).  While not a disastrous error~ they do take quite a bit of fucking with and scraping to get the lobes to retract fully- and even then~ it takes quite a bit of effort.     BD's biggest problem as I see it~ is that they're charging a premium for these X4s as if they were a perfect product~ when this clearly isn't the case.  Both problems could be addressed and fixed~ but I haven't heard of either happening.  I still think they're ""as good"" as the Mastercam~ but I don't see them as a vast improvement.  Perhaps if they at least addressed issues that are pretty obvious to most folks~ I'd feel differently.  They're not a POS~ but they're not revolutionary either.  Just another cam that's looking more and more like it was created to hone in on market share instead of to address a climbing need.  YMMV",Jul 2011,Feb 2 2014,0

7231,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),9,2, What people discuss on MP merely tells us something about forums. The concern over broken wires in climbing gear have been around for a good 40 years at least and is common knowledge. The need for regular inspection is in the instructions for most gear and for example for my ancient WC rocks (which also cover their cams):-   WARNING: If one or more wire filaments in the flexible wire sling is found to be broken~ this product should be withdrawn from use immediately.    One or more broken filaments indicate that the wire sling is showing signs of fatigue failure caused by flexing. Total failure of the wire sling will eventually result from further flexing in use. Your life depends on the immediate withdrawal use of this product as total failure will occur dependant on individual usage which cannot be predicted after this warning sign appears. If in doubt or if you require further advice please contact Wild Country Ltd.   The concern for the BMC Technical Commitee (of which I am incidentally a member) was two-fold. Firstly that climbers are clearly not inspecting their equipment properly even it was clearly heavily used (or even abused) and secondly that manufacturers were making it impossible to check by covering the wire completely or at least the area most likely to fail. All but two of the cams on my rack have plastic covering the weak point which makes inspection impossible~ that the manufacturers are still doing this tells you something I guess!,Nov 2009,Feb 3 2014,0

7253,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,4," Time for a NEW final update~ after well over a year of use and abuse.   Ignoring the previous posts (honestly~ I've stopped paying attention to the entire thread at this point) . . . Final final thoughts:   In the long run~ I think the x4 are just ""meh."" Given a choice between having mastercams and x4s~ I think I would probably have to give the slight long run upper hand to the mastercams. The reasons for this are mostly gut feeling. I just find myself a bit happier placing a mastercam than an x4 in a place where both would work.   Over the past year or so~ the x4s have proven themselves to be a bit delicate for my tastes. While the kinking at the thumb loop did not turn out to be a real problem~ other things did. The heads got kinked fairly easily and frequently. When the heads got kinked even a little~ the trigger pull action worsened dramatically. Take a fall on one of these in a weird placement~ and it could instantly become a pain to clean~ and once cleaned~ required hand tweaking. All that bending back and forth might have some super long run metal fatigue issues~ but I'll let an engineer who knows better give judgment here.   Kinking is just not a big issue with the mastercams I have~ as they have both beefier cables (which don't tweak as easily) and a trigger system which is apparently a bit more robust (or at least that's my gut). On the other hand~ the thin (and somewhat delicate) cable allows the x4s to have excellent stem flexibility. While theoretically this could reduce walking or enable weird placements~ I have found the difference in walking to be negligible~ but others might not.   The sizes that shine in the x4s are definitely .2 and .3 (.1 is just scary small no matter what). The larger sizes (especially the .5 and up) often a pain to place compared with their c4s brethren. When going with a single rack~ I defaulted to the c4s for the .5 100% of the time~ and the .4 c4 vs x4 was a coin flip. Again it's a tradeoff. The x4s give much narrower heads for weird pockets. The c4s are easier to place~ easier to clean~ and give more happy bomber placement feelings. The big benefit of the x4s is that they do noticeably cover a bigger range per cam compared with either mastercams~ which comes at the cost of the daintiness discussed.   In the end~ I am fairly happy with what I have~ but would be equally happy with a rack of mastercams in the same sizes. If I were in the market~ it would really come down to whatever set I could get for a better deal. With the updated aliens coming around the corner~ who knows if there really is a ""best"" small cam out there.",Aug 2010,Sep 17 2014,0
7254,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,5, While any cam can have kinked cables~ especially in a large fall   Part of the problem IMO is the longer metal sleeve of certain cams ... With a shorter sleeve the wire is more able to flex around shallower plavements that arent perfectly in the direction of the pull   If the metal sleeve of a cam like the x4 gets fixed in a horizontal edge or an awkward placement~ then most of the force of the fall will focus on that attachment point   You can see the difference between the blue x4 and the green alien here ,Mar 2009,Sep 17 2014,0
7255,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,6, Shoo~   In what way is the C4 easier to place than the X4 for you? I have the exact opposite reaction: I almost always pick the X4 over the C4 when they're both on my rack and fit the next placement.   The narrower head of the X4 means it's more likey to fit~ and placing them seems pretty much identical to me.   I agree they are a bit delicate~ but I still love mine. They go with me any time I'm placing gear.,Dec 2012,Sep 17 2014,0

7272,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,3, Biggest reason I think it's worth it to me to keep is that I trad climb almost exclusively in the Gunks where horizontal placements are very common. Better to have a bendy cam there.,Feb 2013,Jun 6 2015,0
7273,BD X4~ ongoing real-world review (will update over time),1,4, The X4's can retract all the way~ even with funky glue in place~ but you will need to pull on the trigger really hard. As in using-two-hands hard.   I got some new X4's recently and I took them to the Gunks this weekend. (I had climbed with them previously in New Hampshire for a few days~ but they were part of someone else's rack.) On the second day~ my partner mentioned to me that she found them more difficult to clean than my other cams. One of the employees at Rock and Snow had pointed out to me how the C4 cams had better full retraction~ especially~ the #0.4~ but I went with the X4's anyways because head width. However~ I definitely had some reservations about the trigger action.    Back at my house today~ I came across this thread~ and I starting trying to mess with the glue~ but I didn't go to far for fear of damaging the kevlar trigger. Playing around with the units~ I found that I could get full retraction on my #0.4~ #0.5~ and #0.75 by really cranking on the trigger~ beast-mode style. This is encouraging in that I'm no longer worried about losing these pieces on a route due to overcamming~ but discouraging in that a overcammed X4 at a route's crux is probably not going to be removed (or repositioned~ if you botch it) until the second can hang on the rope and use two hands to extract it.    This issue/solution seems to be most applicable to the #0.4 and least applicable to the #0.5. I  would be curious to know if other users have had the same experience.    I do feel that Aliens are more flexible~ in that the cam head maintains its orientation more consistently than the X4 or Master Cam does. I'm curious to see how well the trigger cables will hold up over time.   I have been a diehard Alien user for a decade but I purchased the X4's as I grow soft in my old age when I lost bunch of my old cams at Acadia. (I left them sitting on the ground at the crag~ d'oh!) I just wasn't sure about the QC on the Aliens these days~ and I thought I would use the X4's for a season or two and put them through the ringer. My initial impressions lead me to conclude the the Aliens have slightly better camming performance. I cannot yet comment about durability; time will tell. I'm happy to keep using the X4's for now because they're still a perfectly decent camming device--they're certainly not holding me back on anything right now.    How is everyone else doing with cam extraction? Are these bad boys getting stuck all the time~ or does it get better with time and technique? Inquiring minds want to know.,Feb 2006,Sep 21 2015,0

7286,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,9, Galaxy 10.0 is the best wearing rope I have ever owned.  Never got fuzzy on me.  I retired it due to age~ not wear.  And yes~ it does get stiffer with age but not for a few years.,Oct 2009,Apr 15 2013,0
7287,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,10, The Galaxy is a great rope- I have had at least five over the years- a bit stiff and cable like but I like that in a rope- I did all my best rope solos with that rope- Perhaps a bit heavy and thick by today's standards but I would buy another without hesitation.,Feb 2006,Apr 15 2013,0
7288,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,11, Great to hear guys. So long as I have no problem tying my retraced bowline and leading with the rope I will be a happy climber.,Oct 2012,Apr 15 2013,0
7289,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,12, It gets stiff eventually ... The sheath wears well   If yr using an assisted locking device or use yr guide/reverso alot in autoblock i recommend sonething mire supple,Mar 2009,Apr 15 2013,0
7290,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,13, I have the mammut tusk and I really like it. It's pretty much the same rope just thinner. It does get dirty easily but my theory on this is it wears my metal faster so it gets dirty quicker. I have kept it really clean so dirty really has not made it dirty. The real reason why a rope get dirty is because the sand/dirt/stiff burly rope wears your metal and the metal stays on your rope~ then anodizes and turns black. Mammut is an amazing rope! Get it!,Dec 2011,Apr 15 2013,0
7291,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,14, There must have been a change in the production of this rope.   I have a Mammut Galaxy from 1999 or 2000 or so. It is the most supple~  beautiful handling rope I've ever used. In no universe would I call it stiff.   I love it. I still lead in it sometimes~ even though it is past its prime.,Dec 2012,Apr 15 2013,0
7292,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,15, Yea I would be using a cinch as my assisted locking device.    Its nuts how mixed the reviews have been.,Oct 2012,Apr 16 2013,0
7293,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,16," I have a Galaxy Duodess dry 60m rope~ and it has its pros and cons.   Pro:  1.  Durable sheath has survived a lot of use.  2.  Dry treatment still decent after several years of use on ice and rock.   Cons:  1.  Nicknamed ""Pigpen"" - it is the dirtiest rope I own~ in spite of being treated like all my others.  I think that tough sheath wears biners and belay devices more than average.  2.  Stiff as a 1/2"" steel cable.  3.  Measures only 55m~ and has never been cut.  Requires extra vigilance on long rappels.  I don't plan to buy another.",Nov 2007,Apr 16 2013,0
7294,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,17, Get it~ man.  Mammut ropes are some of the best out there.  Galaxy 10 is my rope~ and I love it.  It's my second Mammut.,May 2008,Apr 16 2013,0
7295,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,18, This was my first rope (70m) and it's still going strong 4 years later~ partly because it's stiff~ burly~ and durable~ and partly because I don't use it anymore (except for the odd ice or trad day).   For serious sport climbing~ 10.0 is simply too thick to belay effectively on a grigri~ especially when the rope is as stiff as the galaxy. I've tied a double bowline with this~ and I'm sure it was safe~ but it always seemed like I couldn't cinch the knot down tightly enough - I generally went with a fig-8. For sport~ I like the Mammut 9.5 Infinity and the sterling 9.8 velocity and 9.2 nano.    That said~ it has a lot to recommend it. Mainly in the durability and burliness category. Anytime I'm worried about rope abrasion or wet conditions or just need extra safety confidence~ it's nice to know I still have it.,Jun 2010,Apr 18 2013,0
7296,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,19, Gee Kathy - that's odd. Mine is quite supple. I love mine!   I guess it comes down to each individual user honestly. My partner that I climbed with just yesterday has a Petzl rope and despite what I have read here on about them - his is well over 1 yr old~ gets used at least 3x per week~ looks great~ is a 10.? mm~ is supple and easy to knot and untie as well and we see no sheath damage or separating as others report - despite many falls he has taken on it doing both Trad and Sport climbs. I dunno~ I think his Petzl is as nice as my Mammutt!,Jul 2011,Apr 18 2013,0
7297,Mammut 10.0 Galaxy,1,20, the petzl ropes had problems during the first run of distribution.  Edelrid produces Petzl ropes since 2013.   If your friend's rope is an Edelrid I bet it's as good as the Mammut product for sure.,May 2016,May 1 2016,0

To add another option to the mix:   Could mix a thin closed cell with an xtherm. Can use the closed cell on the bottom on sharp ground~ and if you do pop the xtherm you're not completely lacking in insulation. For some reason its more comfortable / warmer with closed cell on top.   I've found around 15f that I'm a bit cold with just an xtherm (the orginal) alone.   It is a bit more faff.

7341,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,0," This is a first impressions review of two of the three newly introduced Grivel Twin Gate carabiners.  I ordered them from a UK site and paid full retail to check them out.  I've had a few days to play with them inside and took them out for a day of sport climbing this past weekend.  I'll post a further review update when I get some more time with them on the multi pitch/trad side.  I don't believe they'll be available from US retailers till spring '15 so if you really want some~ Euro sites are your only option at this point.  Cost was ~$16.50ea after shipping and import duties (I split the order with a friend and we ended up getting hit with duty fees.  If you keep your order small you'll likely avoid this cost).   Alright~ so what are these things exactly? Grivel marketing aside~ they're essentially a locking carabiner made so by incorporating two opposite and opposed gates onto one biner.  I feel there's a bit of room for debate on how ""secure"" these are vs say~ a Petzl Spin Ball that had a mechanically locked barrel vs these two gates but for most situations I think most climbers would deem these ""Good Enough"". Grivel Twin Gates   I'll tackle the Sigma K8G first as I've had more time with this one and feel it has a bit more ""value"" of the two.  The Sigma if fairly close in size to a WC Helium although at 57g it's not light by any means.  Not a huge deal as it's unlikely you'll carry many of them with you.  The biner fit and finish is top notch and feels very much like a Petzl Spirit and WC Helium had some weird love child.  The inner solid gate has machined notches on either side that let you get your finger tips on it and under the outer wire gate.  The outer wire gate is also wider than typical gates.  This also aids in helping get your finger tip behind it.  So how does it FEEL?  Well~ it really is almost as easy to clip and unclip into things as a normal biner.  I found the best technique was to open the solid gate most of the way as you might normally do~ then wiggle your finger tip behind the wire gate and start to let the solid gate close.  This action helps to push your finger out and thus also push open the wire gate.  It's much harder to describe than do honestly and after maybe two minutes of messing with it I was clipping a bolt hanger from either direction with ease.  It's not exactly as easy as a normal one but by no means cumbersome.  If I had one gripe out this part it would be that the outer gate tension is a bit stiff. Grivel Sigma K8G Opening the Sigma Twin Gate Wide Profile of the Outter Gate.  Helps with opening.   In use~ clipping into or out of bolts or gearloops was very straight forward.  You learn pretty quickly how to work the outer gate.  No biggie.  I don't think there's much revolutionary on this end of things as you could essentially do the same thing one handed with an auto locker or magnetron style locker.     Where I feel this biner IS a huge improvement is when you need to clip something INTO IT one handed.  So clipping a rope in while on lead or perhaps throwing a clove hitch into at an anchor.  Those things are quite difficult if not impossible to do one handed with the other auto lockers out there.  One of my mentors taught me to carry a ""Jesus Draw"" with me to use on a bolt or piece that MUST NOT unclip. (This topic has come up recently with the tragic accident in Eldo where the rope unclipped from TWO PIECES).  In the old days~ this Jesus Draw had two screw gates on it.  it worked but was slow and cumbersome.  These twin gates make that Jesus Draw a TON easier to use.  I will honestly say clipping the rope into the rope side Twin Gate takes a bit of practice.  You essentially get the rope situated on top of the biner~ open the wire gate with your fingers~ drop the rope in a bit and then pull it down all the way to get it clipped.  Again~ much easier to watch or try than type.  I think the ease that one can do this will vary a bit on how you normally clip in your draws.  I'm very much a middle finger holds the biner while my thumb/index push the rope in OR thumb/middle steady the biner while the index pushes it in.  This makes using the Twin Gate a bit of an adjustment.  If you're one of the people who does it the other way (rope placed above draw and then your index/thumb pull the rope down into the biner) I suspect using the Twin Gate will be easier as the motion is similar.  It took me about 5 minutes of playing with it to figure out a good way to do it but after that~ not a huge deal.  MUCH faster than a screw gate and doable~ unlike auto lockers.  Mega K6G   So the Mega is a bit easier to review.  It's darn close in size and feel to the venerable Petzl Attache. It's actually SLIGHTLY larger which I like.  So think of the Mega as a Twin Gate Attache and you're real close.  The Solid Gates are a bit different.  The outer gate doesn't open quite as far as the wire on the Sigma.  A limitation of the mechanics of a solid gate I suspect. I've only played with this one in the house - clipping into and out of belay devices and about hanger or two.  No outside use yet.  I don't like it as much as my magnetron rock lock or attache for belay use (though I haven't had a chance to use it with my GriGri2 - that's on loan for a week or two)  Using it with an ATC or ClickUp~ the smaller gate opening and ""extra"" gate metal you had to work through the device etc was less ideal than a standard~ key lock nosed carabiner.  Again~ I think where the value of these designs lies is in one handed use clipping things INTO them.  So here~ I can see them being handy as master point biners etc.  I've thrown a clove hitch into one one handed at it was pretty straight forward.  I'll get them out on some multi pitch to test more but I suspect having one or two might be handy.   So~ are they world changing? Perhaps for the very specific purpose of an easy-to-use rope side locker but for other things~ I think they're a nice improvement but not a must have.  I suspect people who see the utility of a Jesus Draw etc or one handed clipping will get a few for those needs.  They're a mid range price so the value is there over fancy auto lockers etc.  I'm quite happy with mine and will likely have a few on my rack.

7342,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,1, I just thought I'd put it out there that this was a sweet review that got no love. Thanks for taking the time to type it up. I read the whole thing.    Cheers,Sep 2014,Feb 9 2015,2
7343,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,2, I'm with Kris~ great review.   One question I had was how secure these actually are. It looks to me like they really only protect against back-clipping (which is definitely useful) but it does look like gate flutter could still be an issue~ especially since the solid gate is on the inside of the K8 (unless you think that the dangers of gate flutter are a myth).   Any thoughts on that?,Feb 2015,Feb 27 2015,0
7344,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,3," The gates work in opposite directions so any flutter inducing motion (i.e. banging against the rock) will work to CLOSE the other gate IMO.  While probably not ""as secure"" as a TriLock system I'd say these are certainly more than ""good enough"" to be secure.   With more time behind the wheel with these and the Edelrid Sliders system I'll make some followup observations.   For rope end ease of clipping the Edelrid Slider biner is both lighter and easier to clip one handed.  The trade off is that~ IMO~ the slider system on the gate is NOT as secure as a true locker or the twin gate system.   The Twin Gate K8G is a good trade off for more security while still being ""on lead"" clip-able.  I can see using this on a 60cm sling where you really want that security (the eldo accident comes to mind)   The Attache-esque twin solid gate is quite nice so I could see using it as your belay biner~ just not sure that system is ""Better"" than say the magnetron setup.     I honestly just need to get more mileage on a lot of the new tech.  Many times your preferences take a while to sort themselves out (hence why I tend to gear whore and then sell later)",Jun 2006,Feb 28 2015,0
7345,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,4, Yeah~ I just figured that if gate flutter opens up your inside gate~ and the rope slips in between~ then it doesn't matter if the outside gate is closed because the rope can push it right open. I definitely see the appeal~ I just don't think that I would go for this over the Magnetron system.,Feb 2015,Feb 28 2015,0

7348,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,7, I just acquired a third variation on this theme: the Grivel Lambda K7G twin-gate carabiner.   The Lambda is exactly the same size as the old classic Petzl Attache~ but it has a slightly better shape. Specifically~ the wide end is a little steeper~ directing the rope toward the spine side~ and the narrow end is a little squarer~ for a more natural fit on webbing. It also has a more sophisticated cross-sectional shape~ with a nice fat round end for the rope and much less metal everyplace else. I like this shape much more than the new I-beam Attache.  Grivel Lambda K7G twin-gate carabiner   Each of the Lambdas that I got weighs just under 67g~ which is a bit lighter than Grivel's other HMS carabiner~ the Mega~ which is a slightly larger carabiner.    Oddly~ though smaller overall~ the Lambda has a larger gate opening than the Mega. The Lambda K7G has exactly the same gates as the Sigma K8G -- a bent key-lock gate on the inside and a wire gate on the outside.   My first impression was of the amazing fit and finish. These are truly objects for gear porn~ with no evidence that any flash ever needed removal after they were forged. And the satin finish seems really classy. Even my DMM carabiners look crude in comparison.   I have only had a little while to get used to operating the twin gates~ but it feels pretty easy~ especially for unclipping.   Though some have said that the Grivel twin-gates are a solution looking for a problem~ I think they are the future of auto-locking carabiners.,Apr 2010,Apr 1 2015,2
7349,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,8, Great review thanks. Saw this and bought some for anchors and long slings on runouts when I prefer more piece of mind.

7350,Grivel Twin Gate Review - Sigma K8G & Mega K6G,1,9, Solid reviews guys.    Overall I do like the concept of these biners and I feel like I might invest in two quick draws for my rack for putting into the anchors at the top of a route. I would say that they beat traditional screw lock biners and are as good as (or maybe a notch below) the BD magnetron lockers which are also pretty sweet if you get the light weight version of the magnetron.    I don't feel like these would be the best for aggressive sport routes where you just want to slap the draw in and move though. And traditional biners are safe if you don't back clip them which is how grivel presents traditional carabines when they're trying to sell these twin gates. Their sales video is fairly  obnoxious if you haven't seen it.,Jun 2015,Nov 24 2015,0

I know there been some recent discussion of the device but I figured people might appreciate a longer writeup. Cheers!   maxforbes.squarespace.com/w…,Jan 2014,Apr 13 2016,0
7353,DMM Pivot Long Term Review ,1,1," device hardly makes lowering in plaquette mode easier. The advantage gained from the pivoting axle is negated by the smaller slots of the plate. The device does work very well with ropes under 10mm. in response to your comment~ ""guides only use gri gris for lowering.."" this is not true. My preferred method for lowering is always a redirected plate- Whether I am lowering my partner OR victim~ litter~ and attendant in a full on vertical rescue.",unknown,Apr 13 2016,0
7354,DMM Pivot Long Term Review ,1,2, Your pic of lowering in guide mode isn't quite right. For the backup to 'work' the brake strand should be redirected 'up' to the anchor~ through a biner clipped to the anchor and down to your backup Prussik. See how by opening the device with the sling in the pic you've basically taken the belay device out of the system and the climber's strand is pretty much hanging off a rounded biner? By redirecting the brake you'll keep the brake strand in the device channel and it'll be a lot safer to lower! Because you posted this review presenting yourself as knowledgable on the use of the device I think it's crucial this be fixed ASAP.,Apr 2012,Apr 13 2016,0

7365,Warmest Mitts for Denali?,1,0, I'm planning a Denali trip for May~ but I want to buy warmer mitts. Currently I've got some Mountain Equipment Fitzroy mitts~ which I'm told are warmer than the OR Alti mitts.   Anyone have experience with warmer mitts? Maybe...   1. Rab 8000m expedition mitts ($175~ 280g~ 850FP hydrophobic down) rab.equipment/us/shop/exped…   2. Marmot's 8000m series ($275~ 360g~ 700+ FP down. There's gotta be some reason the Marmots are $100 more than most other mitts~ right??)? marmot.com/products/details…   3. OR Firebrand ($290~ 386g military.outdoorresearch.co…   I was on Rainier this March~ and tried wearing a pair of BD Guide split-fingers with North Face e-Tip liners and hand warmers. My hands stayed cooooold until I swapped to the mitts~ so I need something warmer than the average bear uses. I've got Raynaud's and am NOT keen on losing some fingers~ so the price is immaterial.   Any suggestions on warmers liners would be much appreciated~ too. Or maybe it'd be better not to wear liners~ so your fingers are touching in the mitt? Or contact an outdoor company about buying a pair of lobster claw liners~ like mitts come with?   Thanks in advance!   Daniel,Mar 2016,Apr 3 2016,0

7370,Fixe alien cable issue,1,0, All~       I have been following the Fixe Alien problems recently on MP and I noticed a problem of my own. I bought this red alien about 2 years ago and at that time the cable going into the head appeared slightly brown but intact. The brown spot appears to be heat related or so I assume. I have been trad climbing with this piece on and off for two years with no major falls~ and certainly no falls in horizontal placements. After giving mine a thorough check a few months back the cable is starting to break at these brown areas on two sides. Check out the pics. I attempted to contact Fixe on 2/6/16 with no response~ and I am posting here so others can take a look too. Side 2  Side 1,Aug 2006,Mar 31 2016,0
7371,Fixe alien cable issue,1,1, I wouldn't stress on it~ that cable doesn't really do much - the 4 smaller ones hold the force of the fall~ and they look fine.,Jan 2012,Mar 31 2016,0

7380,Fixe alien cable issue,1,10," That's pretty messed up. You can continue to use it though~ as long as you don't ever fall on it.    Sorry~ just trying to add to the Burch shitshow. My advice~ like his~ is soooooo wrong. The correct advise is to sell it on Mountain Project. Text like this will sucker someone:  ""Burch special~ near new Fixe Alein~ some wear but never fallin on it. Fixe continued the Alein tradition in making these fine cams....blah blah"" Then you can trade up to the new improved ""Alein Lites"". The improvement is that you do not have to wait so long for them to bust up. http://www.mountainproject.com/v/fixe-hardware-alien-evolution-lite-cam-failure/111254514__1   Oh yes~ please go ""AHHH HAAH~ you misspelled Alien twice!""    Seriously~ if they won't make good on it~ time to retire it. Sure you could use it for a few more years~ especially as a backup in a troprope anchor~ but better to toss it out and avoid Fixe and go with Totems or Metolius in the future.

7390,Petzl Laser Speed Light ice screw~ long term review,1,0, what's your long term experience with the Petzl Laser Speed Light screws? Currently I have half a rack of Speed Lights and half of the BD Express screws.    I love the Speed Lights. They go in faster than the BDs~ are so much lighter and fit in tighter places. However~ they don't rack as well and you have to much more careful to protect the threads.    I'm thinking of ditching the rest of my Express screws and getting a full rack of Speed Lights. I've heard two concerns though...   1. under certain conditions the core will freeze in the screw while you're placing it. In a short season of use I haven't experienced that (climbing in both below 0 deg F and 30 - 40 deg F weather).    2. when they get dull they're hard to sharpen to original condition and perform worse than the BD Express screws. I wonder if the LIM'ICE Screw Sharpener will work for these screws.    What's your experience? Should I go with all Speed Lights? they're 20% off at a number of online stores now.,Aug 2011,Mar 26 2016,0
7391,Petzl Laser Speed Light ice screw~ long term review,1,1, Rack your screws on four ice clippers. That should clean things up.    Dont worry about something you've never experienced. I've had one 22 cm screw stick while I was building a V Thread. I contacted Petzl and after some back and forth they said I could get a new screw. Besides that one time I've never had a Laser Light stick. I have an entire rack and have used them when's it's 40 or when it's -5. I've placed  them once in a day or all day.    I surprised to hear this is a problem. I bottomed out a 13 and it didn't make a difference on how easy the screw was to place. I sharpened it and the 13 works great. I've got maybe 40 days on my Laser Speed Light rack maybe more and I've never sharpened them. All screws still start better than BD Express screws.     I would think Laser Speeds are no brainer. A rack of Laser Speed Lites if you like light weight~ fancy and expensive.,Jul 2012,Mar 26 2016,0
7392,Petzl Laser Speed Light ice screw~ long term review,1,2, Bill: thanks for your insights. I will probably continue replacing BD Express screws with Laser Speed Lights as my budget allows.    BTW~ in doing some research on the Petzl Lim'ice it looks like it reconfigures the teeth to an older~ less aggressive tooth configuration. So I'll stick with hand filing to keep those Laser Speed screws sharp.,Aug 2011,Mar 28 2016,1

7398,Thoughts on Asolo Alta Via GV,1,0, Looking for a new ice boot and have found one of the best fitting women's specific boot I've tried on: the Asolo Alta Via GV. If you have them or have heard of them~ what do you think of them? I want to know your likes~ dislikes~ the quirks~ pros~ cons~ etc.    Although I am looking at the women's model~ I'd like to hear from men and women!    Thank you,Oct 2015,Nov 24 2015,0

7400,Thoughts on Asolo Alta Via GV,1,2, Hi Peter~    I did not end up getting them as they are less of an ice climbing boot than I wanted. I did sell them to a woman at the shop I work at who wanted to hike peaks in the winter/spring~ and she was very happy with them for that purpose. Ultimately went with the Scarpa Phantom Guide~ and am extremely happy with their performance and fit.    Good luck!,Oct 2015,Mar 27 2016,0
7401,La sportiva katana lace,1,0, I was wondering what was everyone's opinions on the la sportiva katana lace shoes. Size and stretch fit~ wear~ support and general use.,Jan 2015,Feb 8 2016,0
7402,La sportiva katana lace,1,1, Don't leave them in a hot car the toe rubber will delaminate (happened to mine~ seems to happen more to la sportiva shoes from what I've read). Other than that they are a great shoe~ I love mine. I sized mine halfway between comfortable and uncomfortable and they perform great. I have a couple friends climb in them and they like theirs a lot too. Highest rated shoe on outdoorgearlab if that means anything to you. Just aggressive enough but not too bad. I might send mine in to sportiva and try and get the toe rubber fixed and then I would be super happy.,Apr 2015,Feb 8 2016,0
7403,La sportiva katana lace,1,2, i like them better than my miuras.  Wider toe box with a slight downturn to the toe. Tongue is a little padded which is nice for hand cracks. i wear a means 8.5 and my katanas are 41 or 41.5 cant remember. Toe lies almost flat but my last three are still curled a decent amount - i have a wide forefoot with skinny heel.  What i do really like is how they just suck on to your foot.   Do really well in thin cracks as well~ edge great~ theres a little indent under the toe the makes smears da bomb. All around think Mocassym comfort with edging performance of miura.     Mine lasted two resoles and then the leather at the pull tab on the heal split. Still use them as my gym shoes and will beat them till the rands are toast.,Dec 2009,Feb 8 2016,0
7404,La sportiva katana lace,1,3, I second Bryan E's comments. Had to resole early on~ really comfy for a good performing sport shoe. Running on my second sole right now and loving them.,Feb 2015,Feb 8 2016,0
7405,La sportiva katana lace,1,4, They delaminate even without the hot car .... Many sportivas do   They are precise~ and fairly stiff   They also take resoles quite well~ having minimal stretch   A wider fit than the miura   On squamish granite they stand on crystals quite well   ;),Mar 2009,Feb 8 2016,0
7406,La sportiva katana lace,1,5, It's my favorite shoe I've ever climbed in. Mine are sized tight for a performance fit and they are insane edgers. I don't think I could fit my foot in a half size smaller.  After a few weeks they became comfortable for a few pitches.  I generally save them for hard outdoor climbing as they make my feet weak from being so stiff. Seriously crampon stiff. You can edge for days. Just set the toe where you want it and forget about it.    I did climb a crack on accident in them and was kinda shocked that my toes weren't screaming. I think my next pair will be a half to full size larger for a performance trad shoe.    They don't stretch much if at all. I kinda think your feet just get used to them.,Nov 2012,Feb 8 2016,0
7407,La sportiva katana lace,1,6, Great shoe~ but very stiff~ so don't go crazy sizing them aggressively.  They don't need it~ anyways...the P3 lets you edge like a dream even in a comfort fit.  I mainly use 'em for trad/multi pitch~ and they're sized comfortably (street 13 US~ I wear 45.5 KL)~ yet edge incredibly.  I wouldn't wear them on anything significantly overhanging~ but for vert/slab to slight overhang they can't be beat.,Jul 2014,Feb 9 2016,0
7408,La sportiva katana lace,1,7, They are wonderful~ easily my favorite shoe. They don't stretch. Don't size too tight~ save that for your Solutions. I just got a pair back from Rock & Resole and if anything they're better than new (didn't specify rubber~ might be C4?).,Jul 2015,Feb 9 2016,0
7409,La sportiva katana lace,1,8, Hmm...Katanas with C4 would be super weird.  Might be better for smearing & indoor climbing~ though.  Kinda like the purple Anasazis vs tan.,Jul 2014,Feb 9 2016,0
7410,La sportiva katana lace,1,9, Thanks for all the replies. This will be my second pair of shoes and my first pair was way to big but i still climbed in them for over a year. I have been looking at the katanas and couldn't decide if I should go with the 40.5 that pinched the hell out of my toes but only when i got on the wall or the 41 that was very comfortable. If the toe box isn't going to stretch than i think i will stick with the 41 otherwise i would go with the smaller pair and break them in.,Jan 2015,Feb 9 2016,0
7411,La sportiva katana lace,1,10, Go with the 41.  They really don't stretch much~ and with the stiff toebox~ you can cause some toe damage if you go too tight.  Plus~ the P3 lets you edge well without having to downsize too aggressively.  They should feel snug~ but not painful; if you feel pain when you weight them (stand on a hold)~ they're probably too tight.   Speaking from the experience of someone who had to buy 2 pairs because the first was too tight. :/,Jul 2014,Feb 9 2016,0
7412,La sportiva katana lace,1,11, What's the consensus on sizing to get your big toe mostly *flat* for cracks? Half euro down from your street shoe? I want to be able to jam and still stand around on granite crystals.   I tried on a 40.5 and it was a good edging performance fit that seemed decently comfortable. My toes were knuckled enough that I would not be able to jam straight in on thin hands. Unfortunately the shop didn't have a 41 and 41.5 to try on.   I'm a 42 street/approach shoe   40.5 TC pro performance fit (ever so slightly knuckled big toe after break in)   39.5 python    41.5 vapor,Jan 2015,Feb 10 2016,0
7413,La sportiva katana lace,1,12, 1/2 size to whole size~ depending on how loose you wear your street shoes.  I usually wear size 13 US street and my Katanas are 45.5...toes are pretty flat~ maybe slightly curled but it hasn't affected crack climbing.  Keep in mind that the toe is slightly downturned~ so it'll feel a little different than a TC Pro or Mythos~ although some people have reported this helps with thinner cracks.,Jul 2014,Feb 10 2016,0
7414,La sportiva katana lace,1,13, I love mine! They are about to go in for their first resole!   Pros:   - They fit my foot wonderfully!   - They are aggressive and secure without being too painful   - Most of the shoe is high quality and will last   Cons:   - mine de-laminated... This seems like a quality issue~ be really picky and look for early signs of de-lamination when you buy them. They are worth it~ but just be careful.,May 2015,Feb 29 2016,0

7416,La sportiva katana lace,1,15,,Nov 2007,Mar 3 2016,0
7417,La sportiva katana lace,1,16, I might be an outlier here~ but I think they're just OK. Don't get me wrong~ they are incredible at edging and have a great fit. I just feel like they aren't sensitive enough. If I'm climbing in slow motion and laser in on every foothold~ they are very precise. But for some reason I feel more likely to miss the right part of the foothold. Unless I need a very precise edge and stiffness~ I usually reach for my Anasazi Pinks for general confidence inspiring stickyness.   As for sizing~ I wear 10.5 Pinks~ 10 Moccs (comfy fit)~ 43.5 Katana Lace (medium tight)~ 42 Solutions   I would also agree with not sizing Katanas too tight~ I had a pair of 42.5 that were excruciating. Being as stiff as they are~ may as well size them big so they don't suck in cracks like mine do.,Aug 2014,Mar 6 2016,0
7418,La sportiva katana lace,1,17, Yeah~ I would definitely agree that sensitivity is their weakness...I wouldn't want to climb roofs in them~ and I generally don't wear them for sport climbing unless it's something vertical/slabby with REALLY thin edges.  I'm curious as to how they compare to TC Pros~ for those who own/have owned both; do the TC Pros edge as well?  More/less comfortable?  I'm guessing that Katanas will fair better on slightly overhanging routes~ but then I'd usually reach for a pair of Moccs...it's a tricky niche.  If you only owned 1 pair of shoes~ they're probably the best you could get...but who does that? :p,Jul 2014,Mar 6 2016,0
7419,La sportiva katana lace,1,18, I love mine as well~ but I bought too small. I wear a 43 in the Nagos~ and should have bought these in a 43 as well. I have a 42.5 and they kill me on longer routes~ but they work well. They are a lot less sensitive than the Nagos as well~ which took some getting used to (as would any higher performance shoe).,Apr 2015,Mar 6 2016,0

7421,La sportiva katana lace,1,20, 11.5/12 Street shoe   43.5 Katana Lace (Tight Performance)   44 TC Pros & Mythos (relatively flat foot)   I only put on the katanas for overhung climbing; everything else goes to my TCs. I find they edge pretty similarly~ even with the size difference~ while the tc pros smear much better. Probably if I buy them again I'll get the 44 and just crank the laces down more when I need to.,Aug 2014,Mar 7 2016,0
7422,La sportiva katana lace,2,0, Yeah~ that's what I do...nice thing about laces.  To be honest~ downsizing aggressively on the Kl is pointless; if you're going to do that~ you may as well get another shoe (like the Miura VS).  The advantage of the Katana is that they edge well without downsizing~ so you can be comfortable on longer climbs without feeling insecure in your footing.,Jul 2014,Mar 9 2016,0
7423,La sportiva katana lace,2,1, Not related to performance but I love the padded tongue.  The first time I tried them on I had to have them.  I moved from the Katana velcro~ the Lace is different and superior shoe.,Oct 2007,Mar 9 2016,0

7426,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,2, Thanks for the writeup.  I own both devices as well~ and thought your review was spot on.  Like you~ the biggest challenge I've had with the Cinch is unlocking it quickly when a dogging partner starts climbing again.  Glad to hear I'm not the only one.  It's a great piece of gear.,Nov 2006,Aug 16 2007,0
7427,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,3, Nice review~ Josh.  I have used the Cinch for the past few years (both old and new models)~ and it has become my belay device of choice for many routes.   Another point to mention is that the Cinch is designed for 9.4 mm to 11 mm ropes~ whereas the GriGri is designed for 10 mm to 11 mm ropes.  I think some of the problems people have had with the GriGri are due to using it with ropes less than 10 mm in diameter.  The Cinch is the preferred device for skinnier ropes.   I especially like using the Cinch to belay directly off the anchor when bringing up my partner.  This use is sanctioned by Trango and is detailed in their instructions:   Belaying a second off the anchor with the Trango Cinch. Control brake end of rope at all times.  Belaying a second off the anchor with the Trango Cinch.  Control brake end of rope at all times.   Lowering a climber with the Trango Cinch. Redirect brake-end of rope through carabiner when lowering.  Lowering a climber with the Trango Cinch.  Redirect brake-end of rope through carabiner when lowering.   Lowering a climber directly off the anchor with the Cinch is much easier than with other devices like the Trango B-52 or the Black Diamond ATC-Guide.   Trango says you can belay directly off the anchor only when bringing up a second~ not when belaying a leader.,Jan 2001,Aug 16 2007,0

7431,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,7, I'm finally giving myself up completely to the dark side: I think I'm going to invest in a Cinch or GriGri. So I have a couple questions for those of you in the know. Given that my main (probably only) use will be in the gym and at sport crags~ does anyone have any strong opinions about which device is better? IF I end up going with the Cinch and IF I like it well enough to use on multi-pitch climbs~ I assume that you can rappel with it on only a single line which would require carrying an extra piece of gear (an ATC or whatever) to avoid simul-rapping (or leaving your cord behind!)~ no...?    Great Cinch review~ BTW.,Apr 2006,Jan 29 2008,0

7436,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,12," Nice thorough review. One minor issue:    ""...and doesn't damage the rope like a Mini TRAXION""   I've done tons of minitrax soloing and most people I know use it in the same application. I have never seen it cause even the slightest amount of rope damage.  Maybe you had a different experience with it~ but it's an unjustified slag on the minitrax IMO.",Nov 2006,Jan 29 2008,0
7437,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,13, I haven't used a Cinch before~ so I'm afraid I have nothing pertinent to say about Cinch vs. Grigri.  However~ I've rappelled off a few multi-pitch routes with the Grigri and have really liked it.  When I'm doing long multi-pitch rappels or free-hanging rappels~ when my arm would normally get tired with an ATC~ it's nice having an auto-locking pinch-off~ especially after a challenging route when I'm pumped already.    I used the system shown in the manual~ like brenta pointed out.  The trigger/handle piece takes just a minute to get used to it~ by feel I mean.  Just make sure you don't depend on the auto-lock function~ always keep a hand on the slack end of the rope and back up your rappel with a Prussik~ and tie knots in the ends of the rope.     As for sport cragging and the gym~ I use the Grigri more than my ATC.  You have to be johhny-on-the-spot when belaying a leader~ because if you're not careful the Grigri can pinch the rope when the leader is trying to pull slack for a clip.  But it doesn't take much time before you get the hang of it.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions.  See other threads on this board regarding proper belaying technique~ people have been overly dependent on the auto-lock function (or otherwise used the device improperly) and have dropped a leader before.,May 2006,Jan 29 2008,0
7438,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,14, If you are not going to leave the ground (sport~ gym~ and TR climbing)~ the Grigri is probably the best fit.  It is easier to control the lowering speed with a Grigri.     The Cinch is lighter which is nice for multi-pitch climbs. It can also feed out rope faster in experienced hands.       I can't recommend the single rope rap with either device~ but you can control your speed better with a GriGri.  This is a big deal for climbers over 175lbs. You should always carry a regular ATC-like device for raps.,Jan 2001,Jan 29 2008,0

7440,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,16, I recently went to the dark side and dropped $ on an autolocker.  I have used both exstensively.  I chose the cinch for several reasons:  Its lighter~ it handles more rope sizes~ and it locks off harder.  The trade off is that it is slightly less inuitive than the gri and less smooth.   If your main purpose is gym and sport with a lot of hanging~ I wold go with the grigri.  If you want something thats light and grippy for other things~ the cinch gets my vote.   I think I might end up purchasing both~ sigh. ,Aug 2007,Apr 16 2008,0
7441,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,17, I just popped for the Cinch.  In short - i like it a LOT.  The added margin of safety due to the autolock is nice to have - especially when my belayer is my daughter.,May 2007,Apr 25 2008,0
7442,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,18, Good review.  In response to those asking for opinions about this type of autolocking device.  Based on my experience:   1.  Gri-gri~Cinch~ etc. devices are most useful for times when fatigue or distraction can create a potentially unsafe belaying situation.  For me~ that is aid/wall climbing and very long all-day type multi-pitch affairs.   2.  I have done a lot of rope soloing and would never consider these devices for soloing.  They are not designed for it.  If you are serious about safely rope soloing~ then I would recommend the devices specifically designed for the~ i.e. Wren's solo-aid~ soloist~ or silent partner.  Each has it's use~ although the SP works for all situations~ except very cold weather use.   3. I generally do not use these for gym~ sport~ or routine trad climbing because they are clumsy for feeding rope~ taking in slack~ and lowering.,Apr 2008,Apr 25 2008,0
7443,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,1,19," I just wanted to comment on my experiences with the Cinch.    I learned to belay on an ATC and I find that the Cinch allows me to feed rope much more smoothly~ safely~ and efficiently. Though~ I do agree that the lowering can be jerky in untrained hands.   As far as soloing goes (TR soloing ONLY) I use the Cinch as my main device because it follows me smoothly on its own and has never failed to lock up in a fall. But to back this up~ I trail a Mini-Traxion on a 10"" sling below and on the second strand of rope (I usually tie a bight mid-rope and solo <30m routes~ hence the two strands). Put 'em both on a BelayMaster to avoid cross-loading and you're good to go. In my mind~ this is the safest method available without splurging on a solo-device that has one purpose only.    BTW: I saw a guy with a bright orange Cinch at the BRC~ what's the deal with those? Do you have to work for Trango to rock the snazzy ones?",Apr 2007,Apr 25 2008,0

7445,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,2,0, I have used a Gri-Gri for years and got damn good at using it.  However~ I find the Trango Cinch to be easier to use~ lighter~ and safer.  Feeding out rope to the leader is faster~ super smooth and you do not have to temporarily hold down the locking mechanism to do so (like with the Gri-Gri).  It lowers faster then a Gri-Gri when fully opened up.  This can be tricky for new users.  I like to lower with the device full open.  So when I lower someone~ especially if they are heavy~ I will loop the rope through a carabiner on my leg loop and pull upward for some more friction.  This works great.  I always belay with this device.  There is no extra rope placed in the system when the leader falls.  Also~ it is great to know that I can always catch the leader quickly and hold them even if I am surprised/injured by rockfall or other unforeseen event. I use a DMM Belay Master belay carabiner with the Trango Cinch because it would creep up and cross load the other belay carabiners I would use.  This fixed that problem.,Jun 2007,Mar 7 2009,0
7446,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,2,1, I just bought a Cinch and I love it although my DMM Python wouldn't fit into the biner hole very well but its super burly so I bought a Petzl Am'd and the combo is very nice. The cinch is simple and you can become an expert prett damn quick. plus its a bit cheaper than a Gri-gri,Jan 2009,Mar 8 2009,0
7447,Gear Review - Trango Cinch Belay Device,2,2," I haven't used a grigri much~ mostly bc when I started using it~ I didn't know much about it~ hadn't read ny reviews or heard anything~ other than it was an ""auto-locker.""  When I did buy it~ and started using it~ I felt that it wasn't very smooth in feeding out or lowering my climber.  I couldn't find the right place to hold the release handle to keep the feed smooth.     Recently I heard about the SMART by Mammut.  I checked it out a little~ asked around some and made the purchase (~$30) and I'm very glad I did.  It's smaller~ much lighter~ and cheaper~ than the grigri~ and has no moving parts.  It handles smaller ropes just fine (we use a 9mm mostly~ but I've used an 11 with no problems)~ I think it's rated at 8.5 to 11mm. . .Double check me on that.  It is considered ""auto-locking"" as well~ and I tested this by intentionally taking a short fall (not much off the ground) and having my belayer take his hands off the rope (again~ not high up and he was spotting me).  It locked up beautifully~ and releasing the rope to feed to continue climbing is a simple light motion.  I defintely suggest buying this piece.     My one concern/drawback is that the rope may rub against itself while feeding slack enough for the leader to clip well above him~ so say two-three feet of slack needs to be given~ the rope can rub a little against itself.     Anyone have additional review for this piece?",Jul 2009,Aug 16 2009,0

7467,Best Pack for Cragging?,1,12, I agree with Luc~ a crag bag is all about convenience and preferably cheap.  I was using a Cilo 45L worksack for my go to bag for everything.  Earlier this year I picked up a Mammut Trion Pro (or Guide?) that has a zipper in the back panel for easy access to everything.  I can wander around the Smoke Bluffs and stuff a double rack in and out through that instead of dangling everything on my harness like a prospector (Google: Gus Chiggins for the SNL reference).  It's also nice to have in the snow so I can lay the pack down and keep the side against my back out of the snow and still have access.  Even if I do blow a zipper I'm confident I could make it home with a hasty field repair.,Apr 2014,Oct 29 2015,0
7468,Best Pack for Cragging?,1,13, I considered the newer Arc'teryx Miura packs until I actually tried one on with some weight in it. Not comfortable at all for me.    I also have a new BD Creek 50 and love it. EASY access~ comfort~ and durability are the most important aspects to me.    Tons of room to carry all your gear/food/water/layers for the day.    Easy to find anything you're looking for with full-length vertical zippers to access both compartments.    Additional zippered pockets inside to organize and keep track of smaller items like keys/wallet/phone/contraband of choice.    It has a rain tarp that covers the top of the pack perfectly and the outside is basically waterproof.    It sits upright when placed on the ground because it is basically a haul-bag with clever adaptations for cragging. This also makes gear access awesome.    The only complaint I have is that the shoulder straps could be more comfortable but everything else is spot on so I don't really mind that much.   Good luck with your search!,Jul 2010,Oct 29 2015,0

7493,Best Pack for Cragging?,2,17, I had my doubts at first about the new Muira 45 pack~ but after using it for a year I have grown to really appreciate it. The only downside is that I am still not convinced that it is a true 45L pack...But the pros definitely out weigh the cons.    First~ even with the hip belt not being padded~ I have found it to be just as comfortable as my other packs. I think shape of the back panel and the pack contouring to the person helps distribute the weight better on the wearer's hips. Also~ the materials seem like they will last a very long time. I have used it on every trip over the past year and it still looks brand new. Also~ I can fit a complete double rack~ sport draws~ alpine draws~ harness~ shoes~ guide book~ food~ and a filled 3L water bladder (fully packed). Another convenient thing that I use quite frequently is the bungee type cord in the back that I use to carry my helmet on the outside of the pack. Lastly~ like the older Muira packs~ I really enjoy how quickly and easily it is the open the entire back right on up.   Major downside is that like most dead bird stuff~ it is very expensive (it was a birthday gift). However~ I have seen it on sale on some internet retailers within the past couple of months.,Oct 2012,Feb 23 2016,0

7496,Best Pack for Cragging?,3,0, I use an Osprey Talon 33 ~ which tends to work pretty well for me.   Pros:   - It is the right size for bringing trad gear around a crag~ often a little large for a day out on sport.   - Straps down a rope nicely on top making it easy to carry a rope   - Front mesh pocket can carry things you need to use a lot or don't want to put into your main pack   -- I use it for: microspikes~ climbing shoes~ crampons.   - The Osprey All-Mighty Guarantee is pretty sweet   - Tool carry! This is great if you ever want to get into ice.   - Comfortable to walk around in and hike in.   Cons:   - The brain does not sit well over a rope~ or really over the pack at all.   - The top hole does not cinch all the way closed~ so for winter use snow/water can get into the pack   - The pack material is very much NOT waterproof~ which was kind of a bummer to realize mid ice season.   - The mesh pocket wears fast if you put oddly shaped things in it like I do. After a year it is ripped pretty badly   - I find it to be a very tight pack for fitting all of the extra layers + food~ etc that I need for ice.   - Water bottle carry pockets are very tight   - Removing the brain is annoying~ and putting it back on is even worse. I once got the bright idea to separate the brain with me in a plane before putting it into overhead storage and this backfired pretty fast.     - Doesn't always cooperate with a harness well...   I am going to keep it for a while longer~ I enjoy using it and it sits well on my back~ but has some problems I hope to solve in my next pack.

A year into its use~ I'm very happy with it and would buy it again.  Sits well on my back~ roomy~ nice shape~ quite rugged~ and the side pocket for smelly climbing shoes is a really nice plus.

7507,Best Pack for Cragging?,3,11," I just got a Patagonia Grag Daddy 45L for $100. I like the duffle-style opening and it has side pockets for water bottles. I also couldn't really decide what to go with so I also got the Gregory Stout 45L to compare and I'll return the one I don't like. But I'm thinking that maybe I should have went with the next size up (65) for when I want to hike/climb with more gear. I thought 45 liters would be big enough. But in all reality~ 45 is pretty small still.   The Bergans of Norway Glittertind 55L also looks like an awesome pack. Neither this one nor the Gregory are dedicated ""climbing"" or ""crag"" packs. But so what. You can get a rope/gear into them all the same I guess.",Mar 2015,Mar 2 2016,0

7509,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,1,0, Having read many books on climbing technique over the last few decades I've almost given up. They're rarely worth the time it takes to plow through them. Especially crack technique books. How hard can it be anyway -- you shove body parts in the crack and twist ... right?    So when I reluctantly opened The Crack Climber's Technique Manual~ by Kent Pease~ I was ready to skim it and toss it aside.    I couldn't have been more wrong. This book provides many simple and thorough explanations as to why crack climbing is not just about jamming~ twisting~ and taking the pain. The illustrations are super helpful~ showing jamming~ camming and wedging styles I have never thought to try. I think this book will help me improve my crack climbing~ even after years of (mostly poor) technique practice.    I'm bringing this book with with me to Squamish in a few weeks~ in case I need to reference it when I get spanked.   Thanks to Kent Pease~ Jason Haas~ and Fixed Pin Publishing for putting out a unique book that can actually improve your climbing.

7520,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,1,11, I think this is the best book on climbing technique ever written.  Crack climbing has always been something of a dark art~ rarely adequately described~ only to be learned by a long and intense apprenticeship.  Although previous authors have effectively described this or that particular technique~ this book draws back the curtain on the entire enterprise~ while equaling or surpassing previous individual technique accounts.  There's essential knowledge for the novice~ presented in a way that makes real sense~ and a trick or two for the old dogs as well.,Feb 2008,Jul 8 2015,0

7535,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,2,5, I've just read this and agree that it's well worth it – and this is from someone who lives in New Zealand and paid more than the cover price in postage to get it sent to me. Anyone who thinks this book costs too much needs to suck it up.   This book has loads of information backed up by excellent illustrations~ and covers MUCH more than any articles I've seen. It'll will help anyone learning to crack climb~ and I'm sure it's got a lot of tricks that'll help people who've been climbing cracks for a while as well. Brilliant for people~ like me~ who want to learn to climb cracks but can't get much time on them to practice~ and can't easily find experienced folks to teach me the trade.   Good work!,Sep 2014,Jul 14 2015,0
7536,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,2,6, Those who are griping about the cost of the book~ i don't get it...  these days~ guidebooks are running upwards of $50~ cams are $65 and up~ each... i think you'd all do well to consider this book as an essential piece of gear to add to your collection.  How is all this knowledge not worth $30? For what it's worth~ i have zero affiliation with the author or the publishing company.  I was lucky to get an early copy and i'm now floating ring locks as a result~ OW is feeling easier~ and my confidence is increasing tenfold.  Suddenly things that looked terrifying in the past are now looking attractive.  Can't wait to get out to the Valley this fall and put my increased skills to work on the walls of the Captain.,Jan 2013,Jul 14 2015,0

7542,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,2,12, my friend kent pease wrote this book~ and it took him a long time (years) to get it to where it is.  kent is probably the most knowledgeable all-around crack climber that i have ever known.  he didn't get that way by being born with freak-of-nature strength or talent.  he developed his skills over many years of training~ studying~ analyzing~ and climbing cracks of every type - from the nastiest little tips cracks to the vomit inducing wide cracks.   i learned a LOT by climbing with him - not only the skills required on the rock~ but tactical knowledge about preparing for a route~ analyzing what happened when you were on the route~ etc.  in particular~ this secondary set of skills that i learned have been so important in adding that last 10% or 20% that is often needed to send a hard route.   this book is far and away the best crack climbing info out there.  if you are just beginning to climb cracks and need basic advice~ this book is fantastic.  also~ if you have been climbing cracks for a long time you will doubtlessly find aspects that you have overlooked or have forgotten.  the illustrations are sick - particularly when it comes to the thumbstacking and other techy things.  this is a really high quality book.,Dec 2004,Jul 15 2015,0

While I cringe at some replies posted here on MP when noobs ask how to climb cracks~ now there is a simple definitive answer to newbies and old dogs how to improve their crack climbing! Buy this book!   I have had the pleasure of climbing with Kent fairly regularly over the last few years~ and have been grateful to learn some new tricks from him~ but this book spills ALL the beans! This old dog is learning even many more new tricks than I thought existed! Thanks Kent for taking the time and effort to share this encyclopedic knowledge. What a project!   Good stuff about this book:   -Excellent layout~ organization of material   -Excellent illustrations   -Excellent coverage of basic concepts from a thoughtful engineer's perspective. I especially like the breakdown of mechanical concepts: wedging (chocks)~ friction~ levers and camming. A few of the diagrams showing this woke me up as to how my own application of the techniques were not really doing the job as they could. That slight shift in perspective and how to apply it makes a world of difference.   -Really thorough OW (wide) technique coverage. While I do OK on some OW~ this will open up a new level for me! There's enough info in the OW section to keep me busy for a long while.   -Really thorough coverage of foot technique and body position. I don't think I have ever seen any instructional material that even begins to cover these aspects of crack~ wide and corner climbing as completely.    -There's a huge amount of info that transfers to your climbing in general~ not just cracks.

7581,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,4,11," Bearbreeder is the punchline to his own joke.    He's a mix between ""One time in band camp"" and ""If this were the gunks..."" except you just replace it with Squamish.   He makes me not want to go there~ even though I know it's incredible. I just can't seem to like somewhere that's becoming associated with someone so fuckheaded.    He doesn't even know that he doesn't know what he thinks he knows. Slapping my computer hasn't shut him up yet. BTW~ does anyone fix computers.   As for the book. It's good. It's really good in fact. The descriptions are clear and the drawings are precise. You will have an exact idea of the technique to employ prior to leaving the ground. Will real life force you to make changes? Yes. Will you still have to work hard and pay your dues? Yes.   It keeps you from inventing this in a vacuum like so many have.   One thought on my personal experience~ maybe it's true for everyone. In the case of both hand stacks and for rand smears (what the book describes as crack smears) I was aware and had been given tutorial on each of these techniques and I simply could not apply them. One day~ like a cartoon lightbulb it happened. At the time I was getting progressively stronger and I was finally strong enough to apply these techniques. Keep that in mind as you grow and progress.

7597,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,5,7," Bearbreeder~ showing your ignorance is nothing to be ashamed of - not everyone has climbed on all types of rock~ and that's fine.  But throwing a fit like you're doing when called on it is not doing yourself any favors.   My wife has tiny hands and feet.  She can get decent tight hands in .75 Camalot cracks~ and wears size six women's shoes.  So yeah~ pretty tiny.   That said~ there is no way in hell can she get her toes into true .5 splitters.  Believe me~ she's tried plenty.   Okay~ enough about that.   If you feel the book doesn't spend enough space on fingers and tips~ that's fine.  But what many people are pointing out is that it seems like your critique is based on a misunderstanding.     If I follow you~ you're saying that you'd like to have seen more discussion on footwork in thinner cracks.  But the book basically says that unless there are irregularities on the edge~ or flares~ or pods~ the thinnest splitter cracks will not really accept your feet~ and you will need to resort to rand smears~ or using face techniques.  Therefore~ techniques are provided for those larger sizes that do admit your feet~ and the author instructs you to look for flares and pods where you can get those kinds of toe jams in otherwise smaller cracks.   My experience (illustrated by the example I gave with my wife) is that the author's advice is dead on correct.  But you keep harping back to thin cracks (in granite) that _do_ have such features~ and saying the book should be telling you what to do in them~ while missing the point that such cracks do not climb like .5 cracks (or smaller) for your feet.  Rather~ the flared and rounded edges allow ""bigger"" techniques to work.  Which is exactly what the book details.   As for criticizing a book on crack technique because it doesn't provide slab  footwork technique~ that would be silly~ but I don't think you're really saying that.

7599,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,5,9, It's OK to be a one trick pony when your only trick is Squamish. Still~ a thinking man would acknowledge a world outside of there.   Granite just climbs different. Take Soft Parade at Vedauwoo. .5 and .75 and climbs like a tight hand crack due to the flare. Or Bishops Crack in the Platte~ perfect vertical splitter with no flare but since it's granite~ there are feet all the way up it.   Fact is~ the feet outside the crack are just face climbing. You don't need to be THE SENDER to know that if there is a solid nub on the face that it's cool to step on it. Spending some time on what to do if there isn't a nub on the face~ now you've entered the realm of the less obvious.   So BB~ are you upset that he left out the easy stuff? Did it irk you that he left out your favorite style? Or are you just trying to be contrary because it was so well received?,Oct 2012,Aug 7 2015,0

7605,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,5,15, Thanks everyone for your comments — keep them coming. If there’s a second printing I’ll have some new material to consider. Relative to non-crack techniques: My vision for the book was to present techniques for jamming – basically focusing on anything you can do inside the crack or with the crack. It was my conscious decision to not include face climbing techniques. Commenters are correct in that for many cracks~ especially finger cracks~ face climbing and other techniques are not only efficient but necessary. However~ I had to draw the line somewhere and I felt that face climbing is an extensive subject by itself that well covered in other references. The thin crack chapter is short because there simply are not many different ways to use your fingers and feet in the crack. That said~ if I’ve overlooked techniques~ please send them to me and I’ll be happy to include them in my encyclopedia and any future editions of the book. Maybe some more information on using the crack edge would be beneficial? Relative to finger cracks: As the commenters have noted~ the character of the rock makes a tremendous difference in the difficulty and how you climb finger cracks. At Squamish the rock is typically low angle and the difficult finger cracks are often because the cracks run out and you need to resort to face climbing. Climbing these typically requires finesse and thin-face footwork. In contrast at Indian Creek~ finger cracks~ especially splitters~ are full-on cranks and quite physical. Techniques for these cracks are not especially technical (although squeezing even a little shoe rubber into the crack can be considered to be technical and is a tremendous benefit) and climbing them requires strength and endurance. Other distinct styles are:  irregular steep cracks which often require technical moves~ sequences~ and strength; flaring cracks that require technical jams~ precise footwork~ and good body positions; and finger cracks with pods where you make long reaches and high steps. Each expression of finger cracks has its own mix of challenge and fun. Sometimes you use face features~ sometimes you integrate lay away moves~ sometimes you stem~ and sometimes you use pure crack moves. My intent was to focus on the crack techniques to integrate into your climbing and allowing the climber to work out what is needed for each situation including non-crack techniques~ rather than to present a cook book for every situation.  Relative to toes in 0.5 Camalot cracks: My intent was to state that the crack itself is too narrow to insert your toes. However~ that does not mean that you could not use your feet/toes in wider spots such as flares and pods. Also~ even if your toes don’t fit it is possible to squeeze some rubber into 0.5 Camalot cracks (especially if your shoe has a thin or chiseled profile which extends a bit beyond your toes) and this can be very helpful. It is basically a matter of semantics as to whether you consider a “flare” or “pod” to be “the crack” or a “feature” of the crack. My interpretation is that they are “features” of the crack. Also~ when writing on the subject this approach presents a base condition (no toe jams) with variations. Consider that if the alternative approach was used it would result in complications when writing and confusion for the readers — similar to a double negative as in “you can jam your toes but not really.” This discussion and the relevant crack size of course is for climbers of average stature~ and the applicable crack size is smaller for those with petite feet.

I just go by what Croft taught me eons ago~ back in the early 90s.  Thumbs up if possible for longer reach~ thumbs down for torque if you can't thumbs up.

7614,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,6,4," I may get some flack for this~ but the sample photos show some techniques I have personally dissuaded people from using~ specifically the ""cup and twist"" and the first thumb stack. The second thumb stack is the one I always recommend as it actually makes a jam.    I suppose it may depend on your own anatomy~ but a cupped hand can usually if not always be averted by tucking the thumb to create a real jam.    Finally~ with any fist stack combo I try to go palm-up on the fist I'm cranking on. This can't always be achieved~ but I find a hell of a lot more power when it can.",Jan 2010,Oct 19 2015,0
7615,The only book on crack technique worth reading:,6,5," Ball: Thanx for your comments - you won’t get any flack from me. I appreciate honest feedback and technical discussions. Sorry I didn’t see your post sooner.    An overall comment is that there are often multiple ways of approaching climbs and applying each type of jam. Most climbers tend to gravitate toward a set of techniques they are comfortable with~  and this repertoire is different for each climber. One of my goals in the book was to present all effective techniques so that readers would be aware of the full spectrum and use it to develop a skill set that works for them.  Cup and Twist: I agree that cupping alone is not an effective technique since it’s mostly brute force and there is poor contact with the rock – hence the drawing on page 50 with an X through it. However~ I do find it to be an effective component of a jam  when combined with other actions/techniques  such as thumb tuck~ twisting your hand~ and cocking your wrist. For any given jam~ the “actions” used and the relative emphasis of each will vary to adjust to the situation. Thumb Stacks (aka - Finger/Thumb Stacks~ Ring Locks): I agree that for most climbers and in most situations~ camming is the primary action creating the holding force. Although not as natural to use~ opposition wedging actin is sometimes helpful. This is not an intuitive action and may take a conscious effort to develop a feel for the jam. I’ll often use a combination of both~ varying the relative emphasis of each to fit the situation. Fist Stacks: Orienting your fist palm-up (palm-out) rather than palm-down (-away) does give you more arm strength to use; similar to how chin-ups are easier than pull-ups. The benefit of using our fist palm-down (-out) is primarily in hand/fist stacks with your arms crossed. For this combination~ you can cock your fist-wrist so that your fist locks behind your hand allowing you to pull out as well as down and to use less hand strength to sustain the stack. In contrast with your palm up~ the stack tends to disintegrate with an outward component of force. Sure~ the arms-crossed hand/fist combination is only one of many versions of stacks~ but it seems to me to be the most solid and my ""go to"" version. Using your fist palm-up seems to be more natural with your arms parallel and is also facilitated with your elbow into or close to the crack – which is neither good nor bad~ just another factor.   That said~ there are many combinations of fist stacks when you consider arms crossed or not~ palm or back of your hand against the rock~ which hand or fist is on top~ etc. Similarly there are many factors (crack size~ corner or splitter~ knee in or not~ body position~ moving the stack up~ etc.)  affecting which combination is best for a given situation. All options are open and there is no best or worst – use what works for the situation.",Feb 2006,Nov 15 2015,0

7625,Taruntulace shoes,1,0, I was wondering on what some opinions are on the la sportiva taruntulace,Oct 2015,Dec 17 2015,0
7626,Taruntulace shoes,1,1," I had a pair for a short period of time. They were tight but very comfortable initally but stretched a little more~ and more quickly~ than I expected. The frixion rubber is not terrible~ but not as sticky as the xs edge (not that the xs edge is the pinnacle of stickiness- it's just sportiva's ""next in line""). I found them to be ok at edging~ ok at smearing~ and ok at crack climbing~ and amazing at being comfortable. However~ they were too imprecise to be great at edging~ not sticky enough to be great at smearing~ and too bulky to be great at crack climbing. I probably enjoyed them most the handful of times I had them at the gym. They were plenty comfortable to spend all day in meaning I could just bounce from route to route without any pain. Ultimately~ I  get the idea that it is intended to be a shoe that gets new climbers in the door. It was a great place to start. In hindsight~ I wish I'd started with something better~ or at least better suited to me and the climbing I do.   You didn't state that you were shopping~ but if you are looking to buy something along those lines and in that price range~ I'd recommend the nago from sportiva. They're $70 at Sierra Trading Post which is about what you'll find the tarantulace for~ and are~ IMO~ a better shoe. As always~ YMMV",Nov 2015,Dec 17 2015,0
7627,Taruntulace shoes,1,2," I'm accustomed to wearing very tight shoes for maximum performance (admittedly the Tarantulaces shouldn't be put in the ""performance"" category but let's just ignore that.).  I wear a size 11 shoe in any street shoe brand and got the nines in the Tarantulaces~ a size that almost always is correct for me in non-downturned climbing shoes.  With the Tarantulaces I felt like I was wearing a tube sock stretched out by Fat Bastard.  They aren't bad shoes (or great ones) but watch your sizing.",Mar 2013,Dec 18 2015,0
7628,Taruntulace shoes,1,3, I will confidently say they were the worst shoe I ever owned. I bought them because they were cheap and thats what I got~ a cheap climbing shoe. I bet you are considering them for the same reason.,Aug 2012,Dec 18 2015,0
7629,Taruntulace shoes,1,4, I'll Echo Jack on Sizing. I downsized a full size from my street shoe size and should have gone down more. I think this is a La Sportiva thing~ not just a tarantualce thing.,Nov 2015,Dec 18 2015,0

7631,Taruntulace shoes,1,6, They fit my feet fairly well~ but I'm not a fan of the rubber.  I found it slipping on stuff that I could confidently trust with almost any other kind of rubber- C4~ XS Grip~ etc.  I do have a pair that have been resoled with C4 and like them much better.  They seem fairly durable- the laced version.  If you do any kind of crack climbing~ avoid the velcro version.  The straps are cheap as hell and will wear through to the buckle rendering them useless in no time.   Generally speaking I'll echo what others have said- not a spectacular shoe.  Comfort (assuming they fit your foot well) is probably their greatest attribute.  Other than that~ price.  They do nothing performance wise exceptionally well.,Jul 2011,Dec 18 2015,0
7632,Taruntulace shoes,1,7, Bought a pair~ wore them twice. First time i thought it was just a bad day~ second....bad shoes. Just don't buy them. I am a Sportiva fan~ use tc pro~ futura~ solutions. Spend the $$ get the right shoe...the left one too.,Oct 2011,Dec 18 2015,0
7633,Taruntulace shoes,1,8, I'll start of with the fact that I'm a newbie~ just started climbing in July. The Taruntulace is what I got as my first (and so far only shoes) and I love them.  I would agree that they're not performance~ but I think they are a very good beginner shoe.  They are comfortable~ and they've worn very well for me (been to the gym at 1-3 times per week since I bought them and outdoors about 10 times in addition) and the soles are still in good shape.  One of my partners that started climbing at the same time got a pair of Jokers as his first shoes~ and between the two mine have proven to be far superior in terms of grip and ability to use small holds.   I'm to the point where I'm starting to look for a more performance shoe~ but I plan on keeping these as gym shoe.,Nov 2015,Dec 18 2015,0
7634,Taruntulace shoes,1,9, I have tarantula velcros. They're a great gym shoe for the money. They're also the first shoe where I can honestly say that I noticed a difference in performance of them. (That probably has more to say about how long I've been climbing though~ not necessarily the shoes themselves...) They're definitely an entry model.   Beware any La Sportiva shoes that have Velcro~ the durability isn't there. (I've had issue with the one Velcro shoe of theirs I own~ and than have been told that it's a common problem),Feb 2013,Dec 18 2015,0
7635,Taruntulace shoes,1,10, Horrible shoes. I bought a pair during a trip out to Yosemite when I injured my foot and needed a very comfortable pair of shoesto continue climbing. I almost died leading the first pitch of Snake Dyke when they would't stick to anything. OK maybe a little exaggeration~ I didn't almost die but I did start sliding and had to go full starfish on lead halfway through the first runout slab.  They wouldn't stick to anything~ it was like I had dress shoes on.  The low end rubber on them is junk.,Jan 2012,Dec 18 2015,0
7636,Taruntulace shoes,1,11, I'm pretty sure the Tarantulace exists solely due to the fact that outdoor stores (REI~ etc) sell them to beginners who don't know any better.  There are tons of shoes in the same price range that are significantly better...I'd actually take a Red Chili bullshit over these.  For about $100~ you could pick up a pair of 5.10 Moccasyms that are miles beyond them.,Jul 2014,Dec 19 2015,0
7637,Taruntulace shoes,1,12, I've had them for a bit now. They've always been comfortable. The fit is great. They felt awesome for the first few weeks but lately I've noticed that they don't seem very grippy any more. I have definitely been climbing with a very insecure feeling about my stances. I thought maybe I needed to clean them or scuff them up. Maybe it was the certain polished cobbles I've been on. Or that the sandstone was a little dirty. Or this granite is greasy and worn out. Thanks for this thread~ now I know what my problem is.   What are the opinions on getting these resoled with better rubber? Is it worth it? I do like the fit.     Anyone want to trade?! Ha!,Apr 2014,Dec 19 2015,0
7638,Taruntulace shoes,1,13," Tarantulaces were my first shoe.  I was just renting shoes when I went to the gym~ and then heading outside it was cheaper and easier to just buy something rather than having to co-ordinate with store hours to rent and return.   They're cheap.  They're comfortable.  They don't grip worth a darn (I was always confused at how people could do what they did when I watched them smear).  But they got the job done~ and got me to a point where I'd both worn them out (lousy beginner footwork will destroy anything!) and was ready for something better.   The La Sportiva shoes just fit my feet well.  After the tarantulace I switched to the Jeckyl (love them for the gym~ but I can't wear them all day)~ Pythons (bad decision - they're great shoes~ but not what I need) and now Mythos (great for outside~ all day comfort).   I see folks climbing 5.12 in the gym in the tarantulaces which I find interesting.  They're obviously cheap shoes~ but even so they're not going to be the ONLY limiting factor in your climbing. Even though they're cheap~ crappy~ beginner shoes~ as a first shoe I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them if they fit you well.  Having heard story after story of some over-enthusiastic climber guiding a newcomer into painful~ too-tight shoes~ these definitely do have their place.  I think that having ""good enough"" for your first pair of shoes~ and especially in having them feel comfortable and not painful~ is more important than many other factors. First pair?  Go get 'em.   Second pair?  Meh.  Now you know better what you want~ so spend the time and find it. $0.02",Jan 2015,Dec 19 2015,0
7639,Taruntulace shoes,1,14, I'm also a new climber 4-5 months now & These are my first and current pair of shoes (in the process of finding a more aggressive shoe).    I would definitely recommend these as starter shoes~ they're comfortable as hell& can wear them all day without taking them off. But once u start wearing them a lot~ the soles start to get slippery.  So if your just starting out I would get these to work mainly on technique and balance & after u get a feel for rck climbing~ I would adjust to more of an aggressive shoe.,Dec 2015,Dec 19 2015,0

7642,Taruntulace shoes,1,17, Got them as my first pair of climbing shoes. They're comfy and better than tennis shoes but that's about all I can say. There'll be times when I fall off an edge or slip off a smear~ or cant get my foot into a pocket~ but I've never used better shoes so I don't know if it's bad technique or bad shoes. I can't compare them to anything since I've never used better or more aggressive shoes.    I can get on a pinky sized ledge with them and smear decently with the retail rubber. The toebox is also kinda big for me to where it's got some empty space in there but lengthwise the shoe is already feeling really tight.    But keep in mind I'm pretty new to this whole thing. People have said you can get Nagos on STP for 70. Throw in a 30% discount code and 1$ shipping and you're looking at 55 bucks for a better shoe.,Jan 2016,Feb 7 2016,0

The only problem is~ they are going to replace them with the Exum Guides~ which to me sounds like I'm getting another pair that are going to do the same thing. Some one commented that that you can't get a good shoe for that price~ which is ridiculous~ because these shoes are around $150~ I would think for that price a shoe would last at least five miles before being completely destroyed,Oct 2014,Nov 9 2015,0

7674,five ten shoes are subpar~~~~don't buy,2,3, ^^^ thanks for the advice locker! I appreciate your shoe experience.   As someone who loves the 5.10 company I also gotta say some of their shoes are hit-and-miss.  And they're often releasing a variety of new shoes trying to innovate but sometimes they miss so they're cool with backing up reasonable warrantee requests in my experience.   I've heard others experiences (some who work with 5.10) and to my impression~ if they hear about these failures they take that into account and may introduce improvements or scrap a shoe altogether.  That can be seen with the new marginal improvements to the guide tennies which also consequently leads to the sales on the old model.  I see the previous years' version of the EXUM guide shoes on sale at 5.10 constantly.   I don't like being a company's product tester at my expense so I really appreciate this forum.  I'm a poor guy with strong toes and even resoling can be expensive to me at the moment...    As a result I wear sandals or simple chacos for most of my (infrequent) slow hikes and cragging days.  For the past 2 years~ I've been wearing these cheap disposable used pair of New Balance barefooty shoes for descents <1hr.  And treat my guide tennies like gems for special days I have to make long 4th class and 5.4 solo approaches~ and dream of using it while aiding someday.    I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to invest in a shoe based on a company's marketing and then boom total delam failure after one hike.  That sucks.  Especially if it's the first mile in a long ass backpacking trip.,Sep 2012,Dec 5 2015,0
7675,five ten shoes are subpar~~~~don't buy,2,4, I can't speak for 5.10 approach shoes but I will say that I had a pair of Anassazi Pinks that had the fabric between the heel pull tabs delam from the leather. The shoes we less than a year old and used but not abused. I contacted 5.10 and provided them with my original receipt and photos of the problem. They sent a RMA (return merchandise authorization) form within 24 hours. I mailed the shoes to them via USPS for $12.95...I had a new pair of shoes within 72 hours (basically 4 business days from start to finish)...so here are my thoughts on 5.10...they will work with you if you have your original proof of purchase~ the item in question needs to be a year or less old~ the item in question has to be used but not abused~ the item cannot have reached the end of it's expected life span (in my case the rubber below the big toe was getting close to the rand but if I would have worn into the rand~ then no warranty coverage)~ I shouldn't be a jerk about the whole issue (I asked them what~ if any~ were my options)~ treat them politely and with respect and they will probably do the same to you.,Apr 2010,Dec 5 2015,0
7676,five ten shoes are subpar~~~~don't buy,2,5, Five Ten is a good company that makes good products and the BEST rubber.   When you do as large of volume as they do you can assume issues to happen.   The post above has the right idea on how to go about it.

7678,five ten shoes are subpar~~~~don't buy,2,7, Five Ten has the best rubber on the market.  Unfortunately~ their shoe technology (for performance) has certainly lagged behind the competition.  Further~ and namely with their approach shoes~ I have experienced significant durability issues.  Granted~ they are typically within the range of time that I would feel like a tool reaching out to the company about it~ but just barely.  Primarily the issues are delamination.   Just picked up a new pair of their latest generation of approach shoes~ will see if they fixed any of the issues.,Nov 2012,Dec 7 2015,0

7680,five ten shoes are subpar~~~~don't buy,2,9, As someone who's been around longer than I care to admit~ my observation is that 5.10 has always been nagged by questions about durability.  Some of this could be carry over from about 20 years ago~ when they may have used a different overseas manufacturer.  I don't use their climbing shoes since they really don't fit my feet~ but I've had mixed results using their approach shoes.  One pair was OK~ though the insoles collapsed pretty quickly and some shoe goo was needed for the soles and rands.  The second~ a pair of guide tennies~ I used a few times before taking a several year hiatus.  When I dusted them off~ both midsoles completely disintegrated after walking about 400 yards.  Never had that happen before with any other shoes ever.  Their rubber is the best but~ as for quality~ I won't be going back~ at least to their approach shoes.   BTW~ the boots in the OP's photo don't look worn to me.  They looks light they have a couple of scuffs from the short walk the OP described.,Nov 2007,Dec 7 2015,0

7698,five ten shoes are subpar~~~~don't buy,3,7," My experience with 5.10 is bi-modal: I found their ""Five-Tennies"" (dot sole) had a great propensity to fall apart...sole delamination that seemed to be from a mid-sole that too easily disintegrated;...that being said~ while they lasted they were the 'stickyest' approach shoe I've come across.  I even had my shoe-repair guy put a pair of 5.10 dot soles on a nearly brand-new pair of Montrail's and that became my ""go to"" approach shoe~ which climbs well to about 1 or 2 grades below my limit.     However~ their ""Camp 4"" (and similar clones where they made minor changes and changed the name) was a MUCH more rugged shoe with a semi-lug sole. I still have the first pair (brown) after 5-6 yrs~ sole worn nearly smooth and a couple of newer (grey) pair~ plus one still in-the-box.  True~ I wouldn't try soloing a jamcrack on the approach with these~ but for hikeing~ boulder scrambling and slab approach they are great.

I did have to replace one lace; in my vast experience(over 50 years) the soles go before the laces. I've been satisfied with 5.10 especially the camp 4 and Anasazi,Aug 2015,Feb 14 2016,0
7701,Wild Country Astro QuickDraws,1,0, So I was visiting the pro shop at Miguel's in the Red River Gorge and noticed a set of Wild Country Astros on the wall.  I picked one up and was amazed at how light it was - easily one of the lightest quickdraws I've held~ comparable to a BD oz but about half the price.  I impulse-bought a set and took them for a spin~ and I have to say I was very impressed.  You barely feel the Astros on your rack~ and they have the rubber stopper on the rope end that prevents it from spinning~ making clipping smooth and easy.  I found them perfect draws for trad climbing~ particularly for clipping cams that might not need a fully extended runner but do need a QuickDraw.  At $70 for a set of 5~ they're a lot cheaper than other lightweight draws~ making them a great value.  Check them out!,Jul 2014,Nov 15 2015,0

7709,Edelrid Flycatcher Pro 6.9,9,0, I am wondering if anyone has had experience with the relatively new ultralight Edelrid 6.9 ropes. I'm looking to replace my twin 9's which are about 4 years old with newer~ lighter ropes~ but am a bit skeptical about something as skinny as these-they even come with their own belay device since Edelrid claims they're too thin for standard ones. I've checked quite a few websites but could find only a single review. Here's a link to one source for the ropes-unfortunately there's not even a single review on the site. Edelrid Flycatcher 6.9 I've been climbing since the '70's and have several Edelrid items~ all of them good~ but as an old fart~ just got a 9.8 last year for my single lead rope.

I've got a set of Blue Water 7.1's and only use them on ice routes~ they're so skinny that I'm afraid i'd trash them on rock.  Rope management is key with any skinny rope and even paying attention it's easy to get a birds nest. They're not a workhorse and I only break them out for special occasions. I wish I would have got a pair of 8.2-8.5's as I'd get more use and could use them on rock,Feb 2009,Jan 16 2016,0
7711,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,1,0, I recently bought Petzl Dragonfly 60m half ropes. They are bad. The very first time I used them the sheath tore exposing the core of the ropes. This was from normal wear and tear - no falls or sharp edges. I sent the damaged ropes back to Petzl for warranty and they could not offer me anything; not even covering the shipping cost for the return.

7722,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,1,11, Climbed for 3 years on Dragon Flies with no problems. I have also owned two Nomads (one 60m and one 70m); no problems there either. On the contrary~ one of my partners owned one of the original Fuzes and it was a piece of garbage after one week of climbing; fuzzy~ stiff as shit~ and dirty as hell. I guess I don't have any real complaints because my ropes all seemed to be fine~ but at the same time~ I think the quality of all of the Bluewater products I have owned in the past has been quite a bit higher (doubles and single lines).   I originally bought the Petzl ropes because when I bought them~ they were a good bit cheaper than similar ropes and they included some bells and whistles to boot (i.e. double dry~ middle mark at no extra cost). However~ in the past year or two~ Petzl jacked up their prices to equal Bluewater stuff.

7731,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,1,20, There have been tons of people that have had problems with Petzl's ropes. I am amazed that Petzl does not take a more professional stance on this and warranty out their obviously flawed product. Realistically~ they need to recall all of the effected ropes and replace them. Sheath failure is a big concern. If a climber is using an ascender and the rope desheaths~ he or she could deck and possibly die. It has certainly happened before. Most climbing equipment manufacturers jump at replacing damaged goods~ largely in fear of a lawsuit. It seems if the only way Petzl is going to fix this obvious engineering flaw is if someone actually gets hurt and files a lawsuit against Petzl. I don’t mind the lawsuit part as much~ if Petzl is knowingly distributing a defective life safety product then they should get sued. However~ if it takes someone getting hurt or killed before they fix this issue~ then they should not be in the climbing equipment manufacturing business period. Petzl's lack of professionalism in this manner has damaged their reputation with me~ and no longer will I reference them as a leader in the field.,Feb 2009,May 11 2012,0

I have occasionally used one on a flatiron jaunt~ and they've seen some ice.   I noticed the same thing that others did~ that the sheath seemed to disintegrate in the belay device~ leaving a lot of the sheath remnants on the device.   Due to the fact that I use these ropes seldomly~ I predict that they will reach end-of-life time-wise before they wear out~ but they do seem to wear A LOT faster than the Edelwiess Bluewater~ and Mammut ropes I have had in the past.  I won't be buying a Petzl rope the next time I need doubles.   I WOULD like to see Petzl recall~ and either give me my $340 back~ or provide a replacement.,Nov 2006,May 11 2012,0
7734,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,2,2, I agree that Petzl ropes are aweful   I think the quality control is quite spotty. I have a 9.4 70m that has lasted almost 3 years and still looks good~ but the 10.2 petzl rope (zephy?) wore out in less than a year of light use.    Also wasn't the Gri-Gri 2 recalled shortly after it was released? It seems to me that the commitment to good quality gear isn't there. I wouldn't buy a petzl rope anytime soon.,Jul 2007,May 11 2012,0

7740,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,2,8, I really like my PMI verglas ropes. Have been using them about a year and the sheath is still great~ they handle well~ and more importantly they held during a 35 foot whipper (was a 185 foot pitch and I fell at the very top).   I had a Petzl Zephyr. Never again. The sheath didn't hold up well at all~ and I had to retire it after about 6 months.   I have a bi-color 70m blue water dominator~ double dry~ and it has turned out to be a fantastic rope as well. Was twisty for a while~ but eventually it evened out and now it's great.,Nov 2010,Jul 26 2012,0
7741,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,2,9, One more thumbs-down for the Petzl Zephyr.  And two thumbs up to REI for taking care of it.  Here's my experience.   Bought the Zephyr for the incredibly low impact force (something like 7.3 kn) to be the lead rope for scary routes~ long run-outs~ and roped-solo climbs.  So I babied it.     After about two uses (no falls~ hangs~ or takes) the sheath began to show significant wear.  This bothered me~ and I thought about taking it back to REI~ but also thought how they would only have to destroy it~ so decided just to keep an eye on it.     Then about two weeks ago~ I'm first up on a route~ struggling before the crux~ so I know it ain't my day~ and there's four others~ so I figure give someone else a shot.  I make the clip above me~ ask  my belayer to take~ and hop off.  Expecting to go a few feet~ I'm whizzing through the air wondering what happened and whether I'm comin' home to Elizabeth with the big one.     About 15-20 feet go by.  Fortunately~ clean air on overhanging rock.  So I ask my belayer what happened.  She didn't know.  No slack in the system.  Two other guys confirm it~ she had all the slack out before I went.   So I get to thinking~ what the heck is the dynamic elongation on this rope?  This is nuts.  If this were over a buttress or other feature~ I'd have been hosed.  And I was below the last piece.  Scary.   So I decide to return it to REI.  And found this thread~ and the one on Rockclimbingdotcom~ which cinched it.  REI took it back with no fuss.  They even transferred the 20% coupon used for the Petzl~ to order a new rope - the Mammut Super Safe.  Seems like a great rope so far.  Thanks~ REI!   So not sure what happened with the initial wear and the really un-spec'd elongation on that Petzl~ but yeah~ I'm with you guys.  No more Petzl ropes.  Can't believe they won't fess up to some clear issues.     REI gets my monthly tithing for sure - but times like this make it so worth it.,Apr 2011,Jul 28 2012,0

7750,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,2,18, A few years ago (~2011)~ when I got my first pair of 70 m dragonflies~ one of the two got core shot on the first climb out of the wrapper.  To be fair~ it got snagged while pulling on a multi-pitch climb~ and I did some serious yanking and whipping to get it free.  Regardless~ I'd never had a rope get core shot like that before~ and I didn't feel like I'd been that rough on it.  I sent it back to Petzl~ they agreed that it was core shot and said tough luck~ I argued~ and they eventually sold me another at wholesale and mailed it my way.   Again~ first time out of the wrapper~ the new rope immediately got core shot~ this time on a 60-70º rappel on a slab~ so technically not even fully hanging on the lines.  Again~ I sent it back to Petzl~ they agreed that it was trashed~ and again said tough luck.  This time~ I took a hard line with them~ told them they had a dangerous product~ needed to own up to it~ and told them I'd start spreading the word.  They eventually gave in and sent me a new rope on them~ but I had to haggle to get them to pay shipping.   At the time~ I checked online and couldn't find anybody talking about the problem.  I just pulled them out and unwrapped rope number 3 (the first one~ to their credit~ still seems to be hanging in there~ although there are some soft spots that I'm keeping an eye on)~ and I figured I'd see if people had started speaking up.  Glad to see they have.   Don't buy these ropes~ and don't let Petzl get away with robbing you of your money.  If my experience and the experience of all the other people on this forum are any guide~ Dragonflies are~ at best~ a risky bet.  Better off with Beal... or anything~ really.,Apr 2013,May 1 2014,0

To the people that say that all the other brands have great customer service~ I say nay. BlueWater totally screwed me up one time. I had a rope that was defective (had a ""slub"" if you know what that is). The Bluewater rep that comes around to the stores wanted to screw me over. My local store owner (Peace Surplus~ in Flagstaff~ AZ) applied pressure to Bluewater headquarters~ and I got a new rope (after at least 4 months). Not the same though (smaller diameter~ with lower specs). Kudos to my local store for helping me out~ but I'll never buy Bluewater again.",Nov 2010,May 6 2014,0

7762,Don't buy Petzl Dragonfly half ropes.,3,10, I'm a huge fan of Beal.  Had a cheap yuji I used for a couple seasons~ have a Diablo~ 2 joker 9.1's I use for ice~ and this past winter bought a Tiger 70m dry.  Like the 5th time out on the tiger it was soaking water like a sponge.  Not at all like my jokers.  Called Liberty Mtn~ sent them a pic so they could see it wasn't trashed~ they sent me a new Tiger 70m~ only this time Golden Dry instead of just the regular Dry.  Ended up costing me $50 more total to get the best rope they make.  I've had really good luck with Beal ropes.  I've also got 2 New England ropes and a Marathon from Sterling.  The NE and Sterling ropes have held up well for 2 yrs now also.  But the unicore is what always sells me on the Beal stuff.

7770,MI6 Rubber,1,0, Just a plug for Five Ten MI6 rubber.  Had a pair of Grandstones resoled by our very own Locker a while back just to see what all the fuss is about.   Have to say i dont think I'll use any other type of rubber from now on.  Edeges good~ smears great~ smedges awesome.   The only downside may be on micro edges but I just dont do that type of climbing that often.   After a few months of climbing a few times a week they show little sign of wear.   Two thumbs up.,Apr 2012,Aug 27 2015,0
7771,MI6 Rubber,1,1, Few months of climbing on what?   Perhaps if you compared Mi6 to C4 we could get a better understanding of wear.,Jan 2010,Oct 19 2015,0
7772,MI6 Rubber,1,2, Still using my shoes with the MI6 and still really liking them.  The rock I normally climb on is very course granite similar to Joshua Tree.   I have not noticed any cupping or chunks missing or anything you might expect in a softer rubber.      As far as comparing to C4??   It's just better~ smears and smedges better~ I haven't had it in dime edges and if I did I would smedge and not edge with it.   I don't climb very hard~ typically a day of climbing is 5-8 routes in the 5.9-5.11 range anywhere from face to crack~ sport and trad.   The MI6 is a great crack climbing rubber~ toe jams are way more secure feeling.      The only downside would be really thin edges on steep rock where smedging won't work.   C4 is a great rubber but I'm considering getting my other shoes resoled in MI6 too~ the pros just out weigh the cons by a long shot.,Apr 2012,Oct 19 2015,0
7773,MI6 Rubber,1,3," Five Ten Mi6 rubber is great for slabbing/friction routes. It's also good when locking a foot in a crack. Talk about grip! But when it comes to edging~ due to it's softness~ it's pretty much a wash.   If you only have one pair of shoes~ I personally do not recommend it. Better off with a good~ ""Sticky"" all around rubber such as Five Ten C4. But if you have a couple to a few pairs~ slap some Mi6 on one of them~ head to a slab and have at it. You've just entered the ""Gecko Zone"".",Oct 2002,Nov 2 2015,0
7774,MI6 Rubber,1,4, NM found,Feb 2013,Nov 2 2015,0
7775,MI6 Rubber,1,5, Gonna go ahead and be a naysayer. I had a pair resoled with mi6 and honestly couldn't trust my feet on anything. Maybe because it was during warm days around 70F that I was testing them out. Footholds I could stick my feet to with c4 would feel slimy on the mi6 shoes. Every foot placement~ every time on every type of foothold~ slid before I was applying enough pressure to get it to stick. No problems like this with c4 and I am a decently sized climber~ not petite. Also as stated before there is no edging power whatsoever. I'll stick with c4~ best rubber of all time.,unknown,Jan 4 2016,0
7776,MI6 Rubber,1,6, Wow~ that's too bad.   I have had just the opposite experience with the exception edging but that's not surprising.   I'm about 180 lbs and for friction climbing nothing comes close to MI6 rubber~ never had problems with the shoes sliding off holds.,Apr 2012,Jan 4 2016,0
7777,MI6 Rubber,1,7, Mi6 is NOT for everyone!    It is also NOT for every climb.    It doesn't do well edging (Like not at all!)~ and is prone to damage if sharp rock is involved.   Best used for FRICTION/SMEARING routes~ in colder temps.,Oct 2002,Jan 4 2016,0
7778,Edelrid crag pack must have!,1,0, My first ever gear review and I'm very skeptical~ this pack is huge! The amount of space fits 70m plus tons of gear pictured 20+ cams and even has nice rope tarp i have used for ice climbing easily carries medium to large stuff sack plus light rack and more if you short rope! If anyone out there is Ray Jardine add a loose stuff sack on the top it would be great!    Really though a great product especially for pairs~ carries more than enough for weekend backpacking climbing trip between two people. Plus the two tarps together and easily carried sleeping pads makes tarps and bug nets small and easy lightweight options for camping   When used for a single day application has two gear loops carries full plus sport rack a 70 and a twelve pack   I wish there were an option of a nicer suspension with more form fitted hips and shoulders so it were easy to climb with but the pack even fully loaded isn't horrible to carry five miles to the crag    Support your local shops if they have it there $100 but if not I got mine for 59 no tax free shipping Loaded pack daisy chain with a dozen or so loops   All the gear that was packed in it 70m my full double rack sixteen draws plus a bit of nonsense,May 2012,Dec 25 2015,0

7780,Gear storage,1,0," Just wanted to throw this out there... picked up a large (3600) Pelican case on CL for $60 and have been using it to store climbing gear~ ropes & rack.  Seems like a great way to protect everything from oxidation~ and whenever it's been closed for more than a few days when I open it up thing smells like nylon and that ""soft goods"" smell.  Can only imagine this will prolong gear life?  Been the best $60 I've spent + it's the perfect international travel carryon.  Locks rock!",Apr 2012,Nov 19 2015,0
7781,Gear storage,1,1, Pelican cases are great when you're trying to protect gear from threats of external water~ but if you're storing the gear indoors I don't really see the purpose. In fact~ it could end up being worse for your gear~ if you're not fastidiously drying everything out before you put it away. If you store your gear in a breathable bag~ it will dry out on its own. But inside a Pelican case~ the bit of dampness left over after a climb will just stew in there and maybe even grow mildew.   If you're storing your gear in a sub-optimal location (like a leaky garage)~ then maybe something like a Pelican could make sense. But for most people~ a cheap cotton laundry sack would work better.,Jan 2016,Jan 3 2016,0
7782,Gear storage,1,2, I used to store some tents in a plastic bin with the lid on~ and it had that nylon smell. Why don't you just leave it open and let it air out (I'm not familiar with a Pelican). Even if everything is already dry~ you wouldn't want condensation inside.,Nov 2009,Jan 3 2016,0

7784,The Young Savages: a beautiful new book profiling 13 climbers worldwide ,1,0, The Young Savages   By Claudia Zeigler~ text by Annika Müller   Have you ever wondered what lies beneath the glamorous~ triumphant façade of climbing’s youth? We’re bombarded with touched-up Instagrams and real-time news of their latest sends~ but what are these prodigies like in normal life?   The Young Savages is a large-format book of photography that offers an intimate view into the lives of climbers whom you’ve likely only seen being rad on the rocks. To be sure~ plenty of intense climbing photos pepper its pages~ but what really sets this book apart are the tender moments Claudia Ziegler has captured. Like Mélissa Le Nevé~ relaxed~ glancing brightly at her brother while he strums a guitar; a contemplative~ backlit Jonathan Hörst absorbed by his other passion~ football; and Alexander Megos on a bicycle with a boyish smile~ carrying fresh baked goods for his family.   The Young Savages showcases thirteen climbers~ aged 13 to 26~ from nine different countries. Ziegler captures a variety of athletes in different disciplines of our sport~ some of whom you’ll recognize -- such as Adam Ondra from the Czech Republic and Ashima Shiraishi~ of New York -- and others who aren’t as well known~ like Mihou Nonaka~ of Japan and Domen Skofic~ of Slovenia. In addition to Shiraishi~ other American climbers featured are Brooke and Shawn Raboutou~ of Colorado and Jonathan and Cameron Hörst~ of Pennsylvania.    Annika Müller’s prose~ written in German and English side-by-side~ provides a personal vignette of each climber’s life. The miniature biographies~ interrupted with pages of glorious images~ are digestible in just a few minutes. In that sense~ this is the perfect coffee table book and conversation piece.   While catchy~ the title word “savages” belies the tenderness you’ll discover inside every athlete. For if nothing else~ this book simultaneously elevates our youthful climbing heroes while defining them as utterly and beautifully human.   To order the book visit: TheYoungSavages.com     It currently retails for $59.95~ plus shipping ($6.95 to the U.S.),Sep 2002,Dec 5 2015,0

7788,Any Experience with the Five Ten Anasazi Guide Shoes?,1,3, I just got a pair of these and they fit my 11EE feet pretty well. They were initially quite tight in the toes but have stretched a little and I dialed in the lacing & they are now much more comfortable.    The C4 Stealth rubber is excellent and these shoes stick to tiny holds and smears better than other shoes I have worn. They are rather stiff~ but I personally like a stiffer shoe and am amazed at the tiny holds/edges I am able to stand on with the toe of thess shoes. I haven't tried to use them on really thin cracks but it's hard to cram my big feet into those anyway...   They are moderately comfortable (for climbing shoes) and fit has improved with use. I sized them tight but going up a half size would have made toes more comfortable but my heels slipped a bit.    Not sure about durability but they are well made and appears they will hold up well.,Jun 2014,Jul 3 2014,1

7790,Any Experience with the Five Ten Anasazi Guide Shoes?,1,5, I've put a decent amount of time on them this season and I'm in the middle of writing up a more detailed review~ which I'll post up when completed. In the meantime~ I thought it was worth weighing in on a couple questions in the thread.    First off~ these are a new twist on an old standard. It's built on the Anasazi last~ so the scaffolding of the shoe should be familiar to anyone who's used any of the predecessors in the Anasazi line. Unlike previous shoes~ however~ the guide is extremely stiff. Think stiffer than the TC Pro. This is great for the type of shoe it is: comfortable~ solid on hand cracks (and larger) and hard to beat for longer days.    The stiff sole makes this shoe better at edging than most previous Anasazis that I've worn (and way better than the mocc)~ though there's a serious loss of sensitivity as a result~ which can be a deal breaker for a lot of climbers. It's not quite up there with the Miura VS or Scarpa Instinct~ but it does fine on most edges. If you want high end sport~ however~ look elsewhere. The low sensitivity and bulky toe box make pockets and super technical edges a challenge.    The stiffness (and high profile toe box) combine to make it extremely hard to get traction in straight-in finger cracks as you can't wiggle much toe in to get a bit more bite. If you're climbing granite~ you may be able to get enough smearing with the rand and edging on features outside the crack~ but I wouldn't take these shoes to Indian Creek unless you're only getting on 5.10 and below.    Slab is solid if you like edging your way up. If you're from the moccasym school of climbing where you paste rubber all over as much rock as possible to friction-paddle your way up~ the guides are harder to work with. especially since you've given up a lot of sensitivity.    Heel hooking is fine in these shoes~ but I honestly can't imagine who would be seriously considering purchasing an all-day moderate trad shoe and needs super techy heel hooking power from the shoe. I could be wrong here~ but while this shoe is pretty awesome if you're doing lots of mileage both in and out of the gym~ it's really not a good one-shoe-quiver for hard climbing.    Ultimately I agree with a lot of what is said in the gearinstitute link posted above~ though I have to say I don't agree with the sentiment that edging is strong as a result of having enough room to curl your toes. If you're curling your toes in the anasazi guide~ you're doing it wrong. This shoe needs to be sized appropriately such that you're toes are flat (or very slightly curled) but snug. The whole point of such a stiff sole is to give your calves and toes a break so you can climb for a long time and not have to put them in a vice so that you can edge.    Just my 0.02~ interested to hear if others have had different experiences.,Feb 2010,Sep 11 2014,1

I bought these with the intention of using them as a wide-crack and all-around shoe.  They may stretch on me~ but I wore them with socks yesterday at the gunks (38 degrees) and they performed well.  I have never had a shoe this stiff~ but it is great for crack climbing!  Thus~ I am happy with my purchase after sending the 12s (my street shoe size back).,Dec 2010,Dec 1 2015,0

7823,Metolious refillable chalk sock,1,14, Slightly off topic because it's not refillable~ but the worst chalk ball is definitely the Metolius EcoBall.,Apr 2012,Nov 18 2015,0
7824,Metolious refillable chalk sock,1,15, I gave the Metolius refillable chalk ball a try 7 years ago~ and I did not like how it didn't dispense chalk very readily. It was quite stingy with the chalk dispensing~ especially compared to the Flashed brand of chalk balls.   My local shop sells Metolius refillable chalk balls and Flashed refillable chalk balls. Between those 2 brands~ I always recommend people by the Flashed refillable chalk balls even though it's smaller than the Metolius one.   That said~ I realized shortly afterwards that I actually don't need any chalk~ so I haven't used chalk in almost 7 years.,Oct 2009,Nov 18 2015,0
7825,Metolious refillable chalk sock,1,16, No doubt different chalk balls have different levels of porousness.  But another issue is that if you refill a chalk ball with chunks~ nothing will come out---the chalk has to be powdered.  So put your chalk in a ziplock bag and roll over it with a rolling pin or beer can~ etc. to pulverize the chunks before loading up the chalk ball.   One of the main points about chalk balls is that they deliver less chalk.  Experiments conducted by John Stannard 30 or more years ago indicate that using less chalk actually increases skin coefficient of friction over heavy coatings.  The amounts of chalk people apply to their hands from loose chalk gives them a suboptimal grip~ and you can see a partial recognition of this fact in the habit of chalking the hands and then blowing most of the loose chalk off.   Ecologically~ there is a major difference outdoors if chalk balls are used.  The residue left on the rock is far less~ verging on undetectable in many cases~ as opposed to the horrid and semipermanent (no~ it doesn't ever completely wash off) degradation of climbs and scenery from chalk overuse.   The price one pays is more frequent chalking.  And chalk balls don't work at all well if you need to get chalk on the backs of your hands for jamming.,Feb 2008,Nov 18 2015,0
7826,Petzl Bolsa Rope Bag Review,1,0," You may feel this is a stupid thing to review~ but I've found an amazing lack of good backpack style rope bags.  The choices are very limited.  Additionally~ my experience is that when a rope bag manufacturer says it will hold a 70 meter rope~ you rack~ your harness~ and your shoes~ what they really mean is your 60 meter rope may fit.  Hence~ here is some basic info on this bag.   First impressions: the bag fits my 10.5 mm x 60 meter rope with room to spare.  I can fit my shoes~ a small rack (6 cams~ nut set~ 20 biners~ 10 slings~ misc stuff)~ and my harness if I really pack it in on top.  I will likely wear my harness on shorter approach hikes to avoid the bulk.  I repacked it with a TR setup: held the rope~ shoes~ (2) 120 cm slings~ 10 carabiners~ belay~ some misc small nuts and other gear~ and about 20 meters of 1"" tubular webbing.  Will try it out with a 9.8 mm x 70 meter double dry rope later this week and report how much it will hold with that slightly smaller~ slightly stiffer~ slightly longer rope.   More info to come.   Update: the shoulder straps cut in after a short (5 minute) hike.  Will be adding some padding for sure.",May 2014,Jul 7 2014,0

7838,Soloist Devices,1,5, The SP is a better device IMHO. The Soloist won't necessarily hold falls if your body ends up in a horizontal orientation (a partner broke four ribs that way). That said~ the Soloist has been used to do Astroman.   I personally use an Eddy with the rope in a backpack.

Reviews have suggested that the Silent partner was a better choice between the two of them - tho I admit I never tried the Soloist myself. What I did find was the prices between the two devices are quite different. I had to purchased a used Silent Partner to afford it honestly. $250 for a brand new one was out of my budget.   As in anything - I think it comes down to being comfortable with YOUR choice of device - understanding how to use it correctly - the pro's and con's of each device~ having some sort of back up system~ etc.   Everyone has their own opinion(s) on all climbing products.

7865,Soloist Devices,2,11," When i gave up on looking for a partner to climb~ i looked into solo climbing and the first thing that was most prominent in my search was what was then~ the Wren soloist. This was about 6 months ago. I didn't see any other devises coming up in my search at the time~ so i bought one. I like to lead climb mostly~ and would not use this devise for Top Rope~ I mostly stay away from top roping. I have since Lead climbed solo'd a 5.4  (2 pitch took me 4)~ a 5.8 (1 pitch took me 2) and a 5.6 (1pitch took me 2). I like this devise for its function as a Cam~ like the GriGri. So there is no toothed Bite. I am always worried about this devise however~ and i refuse to ""Test"" any devisee by leaping to a fall~ i simply make a point to try not to fall~ and so far have not taken any huge whip's with this devise. I do like its ability to register a pull and cam up even when i slip just a bit~ allowing me to recover~i have had 2 instances where this saved me from a 20 foot fall as protection was stretched thin. To make the devise more effective~ Setting your protection above you gives you greater level of safety~ and reduces your possibility of a overturned fall. all in all it takes practice to manage the rope directions and gear management~ but once you get it down~ it flows smooth and quick. The drag has gotten me a few times when the devise gets a bit twisted in awkward moves or my rope is out almost full and tangles a bit and i do fear the overturned fall. If i feel there is a greater possibility of turning upside down~ i will tie off a stopper knot within 10 feet. takes more time and i have to tie and un-tie~ but better safe then sorry. All in all this devise has allowed me to climb when i could not before due to no partner. I cannot say it is better than any other~ and would love the opportunity to try all the devises to find what is best~ but i don't have a money tree. If anyone can think of a way to create an additional level of safety for the overturned fall for this devise that does not require constant backup knots~ let me know as it would make this the perfect devise.   5.8 Highway To Hell 2 pitch Delaware Water Gap",Dec 2013,Dec 14 2013,0
7866,Soloist Devices,2,12, If i worried about it that much~ obviously i wouldn't climb with it. I did however see a video of a guy who was climbing a crack (Not solo)~ when he was too tired to go on~ he called out falling~ dropped~ caught his gear~ and flipped. He was on a standard belay so no issue~ but that always sticks in the back of my head. Even when you know how to fall~ there is the 1% chance~ so i try to account for that as well. Especially since i climb over some overhangs that once turned over~ is just air~ no additional mountain to hit to possibly flip me upright.,Dec 2013,Dec 15 2013,0

7870,Soloist Devices,2,16," There are a few threads here on MTN Project talking about soloist devices~ so I'll add my input to this particular thread because I had a near-death experience on one...    I've used a TR solo device with zero problems for both ice climbing an rock.  Even used it when my rope had accumulated ice.  No issues with it malfunctioning except during a sleet storm~ where I used plenty of backup knots.  [Note- poor choice to ice climb solo in those conditions.]   I did use the Wren Soloist for several sport climbing routes but then one day decided to push it on a route that I was not familiar with.  Got about ten feet off the last anchor when I plucked off and took a nice whipper back into the wall~ breaking my foot.  Almost blacked on the line due to the pain.  Managed to self-rescue but had to belly crawl back to my truck and drive myself to see two physicians who refused to see me (wasn't an ""established patient"").  Had to drive another 20 miles to the nearest emergency department.    Took me two years to recover fully due to the nature of the fracture.   Lesson learned- be extremely careful with these devices.  Do not climb close to your limit.  Be aware the rope gives very little on the Soloist- it is like taking a fall on non-dynamic line.  You don't have the benefit of a belayer whose body weight / slack in his own harness~ slack in the line~ etc provides you with a bit of shock absorption.  Talk to folks who have taken a Real Fall on one- you won't find many.",May 2012,Nov 11 2015,0

7872,Soloist Devices,2,18, I've fallen on a silent partner when free climbing and on aid.   It is possible this gives a little as it locks.   I always try and keep the fall factor low: place more gear or use it on slabs (i.e. not falling at 9.8m/s per s). Or I use it where the fall will be clean - i.e. overhanging. I use a screamer. On aid I clip it to the hall bag.,Oct 2013,Nov 11 2015,0

7874,Soloist Devices,3,0, The use of screamers is a great idea~ however I should say that I have not had the courage to try a Wren Soloist on ice lead.....  For rock climbing~ it's a terrific idea.   What I did do (a mistake in hindsight) was to tie prussiks at various points to back up my ground anchors- this did reduce the dynamic character of the rope.  It was the only time I had ever done that (I was constantly testing different approaches for safety).  I misstated~ however~ above- I was not above an 'anchor' but rather the last bolt I clipped a quickdraw into.   Always used a chest harness and never climbed anything that could pitch me upside down.,May 2012,Nov 11 2015,0

7876,Soloist Devices,3,2, i borrowed a friend's soloist~ maybe 15 years ago or so~ and used it for a couple months.  then i heard about problems with it catching slab falls or lateral falls (ie with the device out to the side of the last protection point).  i did some tests with a loaded haul bag simulating the lateral falls and it failed absolutely miserably.  never used it again...,Dec 2004,Nov 11 2015,0
7877,Soloist Devices,3,3, Easy to remedy~   When I use mine I tie overhand knots on a bight (. I practiced how to do this one handed on my home wall ).  Then I put an carabiner in the loop and then pull the bottom tight.  Now if the device does fail or just doesn't catch.  The knot and the carabiner would have to be ripped through the device.  This only works for top roping.  I guess it could work on lead you would just have to pre tie the knots and then undo them as you go.,Jul 2012,Nov 11 2015,0
7878,Soloist Devices,3,4," I've only ever used a Silent Partner for solo lead climbing on easy trad routes that I knew I wouldn't fall on.  It seemed to feed well for sure.   I just recently (after reading lots of info here on the site) purchased two Petzl Micro Traxions for top rope soloing.  I used them the other day on a gently overhanging (not cavey) 12+ sport route at AF in conjunction with a 10.5mm Edelweiss Stratos rope that was my bigwall rope.  I aided up the route using my grigri~ fixed~ and used the traxions to work out the moves.  They performed flawlessly and I ""took"" many times including small ""falls"" without issue.  No sheath damage to the rope at all.     I used a mini haul bag with a few rocks in it to keep the rope taught and back clipped the draws as I went.  The devices fed beautifully and were very confidence inspiring.     While I think it would be tough to climb an entire route at your limit using them~ they were great for the intended purpose of sussing out moves and getting the feel of a route.",Jul 2008,Nov 11 2015,0

7883,Soloist Devices,3,9, Ok sorry rope solo God... So you are telling me that on any rope solo device if you have a knot in the rope it won't keep  you from decking??  Doesn't matter the oranation.  If you have an opening in a device that only allows a rope width through it and you put a knot in the rope then that rope will not go through that device.  Correct?  So this could be used on top rope~ lead and aid if needed.  Lead and aid would require more math and fore thought but it could be done.,Jul 2012,Nov 12 2015,0

7885,Soloist Devices,3,11,,Jan 2006,Nov 13 2015,0
7886,Soloist Devices,3,12, Well... First off the knots always go in the slack non-anchor side.  So if on lead they would be below you till you advance them as you climb. Now if you are say three bolts up going for the fourth and you have a knot in the slack side of the rope ten feet below you and you pop off.  First the third bolt will pull up on the device as you fall causing the device to lock as it does.  Now say you somehow invert or turn sideways.   The soloist DOES NOT hold in those positions so you would slip till your knot hit the soloist stopping you so you could right yourself  at this point you maybe near the second bolt or piece of gear.  But your not on the ground.      I'm not saying it's going to be a pleasent experience~ it's going to jerk you around but you won't be on the deck waiting for rescue or for someone to happen upon you. ( always let people know where you are and if you decide to change areas tell them.  I personal have three people that I tell for every solo trip) .

7917,G-String Climbing Grips,2,5, Ring style grips and fingerboards are two different training devices.  Each has their own advantage and disadvantage.   Tom:  The secret to the versatility of these grips is in the cord configurations.  You can manipulate the cords to turn the grip at any angle.   The allows you to offset the holds for lock-offs as well.      I've found several distinct grip positions with these.  But really each one can be manipulated to be easier or harder.

7926,G-String Climbing Grips,2,14, I would think the fact that they may move a little would help strengthen stabilizer muscles~ much like rock rings do. Am I wrong on this one? I thought that was one main difference between a hang board and rock rings,Sep 2009,Jan 3 2013,0

7930,G-String Climbing Grips,2,18, These look awesome!    One thing on the web site has me puzzled. It includes undercling among the 7 potential positions. I'm having a hard time envisioning how these would work as an undercling. Sure~ you could mount the chords low on a wall but I can't picture a statically placed undercling.    Not that it diminishes the coolness of these in any significant way but I'm curious. Can anyone else picture how that would work?,Jul 2006,Jan 21 2013,0
7931,G-String Climbing Grips,2,19, By grabbing the holds with your thumbs pointing out (like a chin-up position) you can work some of the muscles used in an undercling position even though you're pulling down. This orientation of your hands allows you to work a different subset of muscles than when you are in a normal face climb position (thumbs point toward each other)   To better approximate an undercling~ you need to involve the feet and lower back by pressing/pushing in the opposite direction that the hands/arms are pulling.    If the grips are hung in a door or hall way~ it's possible to press your feet (barefoot so you don't mark up the doorway and get a little friction) against the doorway with your hands/arms pulling in the opposite direction.    You can then control the difficulty by which grip position you use and how positive an orientation you set the grips at in relation to the direction you are pulling.   I need to add more photos to that section of the website - a picture or video clip is worth a thousand words... :-)   Depending upon how and where the Gstrings are mounted~ you may or may not be able to get your feet involved.

7948,North Face Bastion Tent 4 season Review,1,0, This is North Face's answer to Mountain Hardwear's Trango 4. I havent used the Trango 4 but the specs are very similar. Trango has all clips while the Bastion has clips and pole sleeves. The Bastion is basically a sized up north face VE25 that claims to fit 4 adults. Its billed as being big mountain ready. split two or three ways the weight would be OK to carry. Its taller~ wider and longer then a ve25. 8 ft x 8 ft x 54 inches. There is adequate room for three six footers. Four tall people would be cramped. four small skinny people would fit.    Pros: Decent head room for a four season tent. No gear loft needed with two ceiling pockets~ as well as 12 wall pockets.   Setup was fairly easy with two folks. Ventilation is good with two doors and two roof vents. Fly has roof vents too that allow airflow. Front vestibule is big enough for four packs.  Reflective accents on tent and guy lines and glow in dark zipper pulls are very handy at night. I used this in high wind but not in snow. It is very stable in wind. It has many guy out points and pole cross points and I don't know if it would reach a limit on wind or snow before collapsing. Yellow and white color is cooler then darker tents and very visible.    Flaws: One snap on rain fly broke the first use. The rear/little vestibule is very small~ big enough for two packs. small rainfly porthole window not very useful. Its hard to get the front vestibule to keep its support pole taut and have the vestibule at max height. I couldn't get big vestibule fully extended vertically and still use all the zippers easily. Front vestibule fly zipper is tight to use zipping from bottom to top and back~ the easier way to get in the tent through that side. Little vestibule fly easier to use.    Bottoms of the vestibules don't stake down all the way around. They are meant to be covered with snow and rocks. I'd prefer if the fly went all the way to the ground   If you need a medium/large size three man 4 season tent with more headroom~ prefer this to the Trango 4~ don't want to spend more money and can get it for the price of a VE25 its a good deal. Not sure if any dealers carry it in a brick and mortar store. The Chicago North Face store and all REIs didn't.,Apr 2006,Sep 25 2015,0
7949,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,0, i am interested in the addicts as a crack/multi-pitch shoe (which is what they're made for) and was wondering if anyone has any experience with them and could tell me if they're a good shoe.,Dec 2013,Mar 3 2014,0
7950,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,1, I have not tried them. I'm still going to answer though.   I've owned something like 50 pairs of Evolves over the years~ maybe more. One common thing I have noticed is that if you are crack climbing~ the insert to increase edging~ like these shoes have~ causes a pressure point in the rubber and you blow through your sole sooner. By sooner I mean days vs several weeks to months on shoes without the stiffener (assuming you are climbing full time).    Aside from that~ they look like extremely well built shoes.   I would get Mocs first though~ they are very durable and are pretty much the same otherwise.   For the most durable Evolve shoe that edges OK (not great) and fits cracks like magic while being comfortable~ go with the defy. You just need to ask them to add some rubber to the back so your toe knuckles don't blow out. Their sock like fit means no pressure points to wear out on the rock. I've taken mine up the Diamond~ the Hulk~ Ulamsertuaq~ and I also did my first 13 in them. They can hang~ even though you'd never believe it based on what the average wearer of them looks like.,Oct 2012,Mar 3 2014,0
7951,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,2," +1 for the defy. At <;$50 online~ you can beat the hell out of em. I also have a feeling they are the shoe that Steph Davis gives out~ ""sized larger for crack~"" in her Indian Creek clinics.    -Mackley",May 2010,Mar 3 2014,0
7952,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,3, i was considering the mocs but a lot of people steered me away from them~ and every 5.10 i've tried on has felt sloppy and wrong on me (heels are completely loose and toes never sit right).   and as for the rubber; would this be fixed by a resole with different rubber? i'm used to climbing in sportiva's and really like the rubber on them and was planning on just getting them resoled with vibram when the trax rubber wore out.   i've never been a fan of evolv before but trying these on had me questioning my love of sportiva's so i'm hoping this shoe isn't too good to be true,Dec 2013,Mar 3 2014,0
7953,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,4, I've had very good luck with Bandit velcros. They won't be as comfortable as moccs in thinner sizes~ but they've been great in tight hands and up. They edge really well (much better than defys)~ and the pointed toe works well in finger sized cracks and pods.    If you're looking for a crack-only shoe~ do the moccs. If you want one that will perform better over a wider range of terrain~ go for the bandits or defys.    Contrary to other posters' experience with the stiff evolv midsole~ mine have been remarkably durable. I guess it all depends on how often you put them in cracks~ the size of the cracks~ what type of rock~ how well the shoe is fit in the first place~ etc.,Apr 2010,Mar 3 2014,0
7954,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,5, I've been climbing in the addicts for the last 2 weeks. I haven't had them long enough to comment on durability or how long the rubber lasts. I will say that I love the fit. They feel just like moccs with a heel that fits me better. If you like the sensitive leather slipper style and are looking to try a new shoe shape then go for it. I've been happy with them.,Dec 2013,Mar 7 2014,0

7956,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,7, have you noticed any considerable stretch? the 10's fit me well and and i feel like the stretch shouldn't be too bad. i have never worn evolvs before and don't want to end up with a loose shoe. i can hardly get into the 9 1/2 though,Dec 2013,Mar 7 2014,0
7957,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,8, I have also noticed that when someone posts up asking about an inferior product~ most times~ their mind is made up and they do end up buying the inferior product.   I've done it~ you are about to do it.   In 6 months you'll go buy real shoes.,Oct 2012,Mar 7 2014,0
7958,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,9, I have a pair and don't love them. The edging is poor~ and the tongue comes to far up restricting the motion of the foot. They will probably become my go to for long easy moderate multi pitch~ slab climbing and the like~ but I still like my muiras~ 1/2 a size bigger for that anyway.,May 2012,Mar 7 2014,0
7959,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,10, Wanting to grab a pair of these. How do these stretch if any? Any feedback is appreciated~ thank you,Feb 2014,Nov 13 2014,0
7960,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,11, Maybe 1/2 a size at most so far. I sized these down a full size~ and I've found they're pretty damn good for edging actually!    Got these for gym climbing~ and sized them small for edging and face climbing. I've actually really enjoyed them so far. There was a hotspot in the heel for the first few weeks.,Dec 2012,Nov 13 2014,0
7961,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,12, Are they made of leather? Or the synthetic material Evolv uses on all their other shoes?   I've always thought evolvs are well made~ but I've got sweaty feet and the synthetic material doesn't absorb sweat well and always leaves my feet wet and clammy.,Nov 2006,Nov 13 2014,0

7963,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,14, I am pretty psyched on the addicts. Pro:    They are the best slab shoes I've worn. They're really~ egregiously sensitive out of the box and only get better as you wear them in. They edge well enough~ but in a somewhat counter-intuitive kind of way. Since they have a super flaccid mid-sole (which you'd expect would make them suck at edging) I feel like the gained sensitivity allows me to know exactly how far I can push the envelope on smearing or balancing on a dime edge or crystal. Though comparatively~ this may ask for increased foot and calf strength. To bang the sensitivity point just one more time~ my footwork in general feels super clean in these shoes. At least as good as any other I've tried.   They're also more than comfortable enough to be a solid candidate for an all day~ multi-pitch shoe.    Lastly~ I found these to fit near perfectly in the toe box and heel as compared to Mocs. That's obviously a subjective point~ though~ since all our feet are different.  Con:   I didn't find them to be especially good in cracks~ but YMMV. The lack of laces (can~ at times) allow them to rotate slightly around your feet on really strenuous jams. This has only been an issue a handful of times~ but I've seen that negative effect amplified when I'm climbing in hotter weather as sweat can lubricate the rotating action. I chalk it up to being a natural trade off/disadvantage of lace-less/velcro-less shoes~ though.    Over-all~ they're pretty superb~ 'all-round' shoes. Especially for being on the more affordable end of the spectrum.,Nov 2013,Nov 13 2014,0
7964,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,15, so i've been climbing in these for quite some time now and can't say enough good things about them. they edge exceptionally well~ are awesome at smearing~ jam like a dream (even on thin cracks) and they didn't bag out. i also have a pair of moccasyms now that don't even compare. they are pretty good at smearing and jamming in cracks down to #1 BD~ but can't edge at all are aren't very good at thinner crack. they also fit really wide and just feel loose and floppy. good for moderate/easy multipitch outings though,Dec 2013,Nov 13 2014,0

7966,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,17, i'm not exactly sure~ but i would think so since they're much stiffer than the mocs,Dec 2013,Nov 14 2014,0
7967,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),1,18, I had climbed in nothing but 5.10 moccs for 12 years~ and I headed out to Yosemite late this august. Nobody in climbing town USA had moccs in my size so I tried on the Addict and was immediately impressed. It was just like the mocc~  with a superior fit and inferior rubber. The fit was better in the toes and far better in the heel. It took much longer to break in the Addict and there was~ as one commenter above stated~ a wicked Hotspot in the heel. Now I have had them re-soled with stealth C4 and they are the cats ass~ cooler than sliced bread. I put them through the wringer in the valley~ I feed 16 pitches on the Nose with them~ freed those scary slabs on the FreeBlast with them~ Bouldered with them~ and I've been able to clip up steep routes with them. Technique is my strength and I am light on my feet and easy on shoes so I can't yet say how durable they are but so far so good and I certainly would recommend them.,Jan 2013,Nov 14 2014,1

7978,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),2,8, Thanks all for the input. I placed my order.   Yes~ of course better to go try on. No argument there for those of you near shops to do so. I don't have that luxury.,Mar 2009,Nov 19 2014,0
7979,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),2,9," So far they seem moccasym-ish. I've mostly gym climbed and sport climbed outdoors with them though~ and they have been great for that. I wouldn't expect them to be edging masterpieces~ obviously~ and I've only climbed one crack.   I had an REI gift certificate and they didn't have my moccasym size~ so there ya go. I'm reserving complete judgment as I've only had them a month now~ but they seem fine so far and more than adequate as a ""stop gap"" shoe while I get my work horses resoled.",Sep 2005,Nov 21 2014,0
7980,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),2,10, Earth Treks had a Evolv demo night last night so I tried a pair of Addicts. My shoe size is 11.5 so I tried on 11.5s figuring they be too tight. I ended up with 12s after i couldnt get the 11.5s on my feet. The 12s climbed great. I felt more comfortable climbing the fake crack at the gym than my Muiras. I thougnt you mignt wanna know.,Jul 2012,Nov 21 2014,0
7981,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),2,11, I have climbed with the Addicts on about 15 multi-pitch trad routes from 5.6 to 5.10 and in the gym.  I love them for trad climbing that has a lot of cracks to conquer.  They are fantastic for jamming in to hand and fist cracks.  They also do really well with smearing.  They can edge relatively well for what they are~ but they aren't great at it compared to something like a Katana or Muira designed primarily for edging.  The flat construction and lack of stiffness won't allow it to ever be a great edging shoe.  On overhanging routes they just don't hook to things like a downturned shoe will or have any where near the power.  However~ I felt that they edge a lot better than Moc's do because the addict's toe is more pointy and it has a small edging insert in it.  I personally like these a lot more than 5.10's Moc.  They definitely got me through some hard edging on less than vertical to vertical~ but they weren't optimal for it.,Oct 2013,Nov 21 2014,0
7982,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),2,12, I demo'ed a pair a couple nights ago~ mostly in the gym's wooden finger-crack~ and I can say that they were far more confidence-inspiring than the evolve Quest AF shoes I so love for all-day wearing and general use~ and wish they still made...as well as the random 5.10 shoes I got on sale to salvage what was left of the quests while I get back in shape. The fit was equally as good as the Quests~ though I think a half-size smaller than my shoes (also climb in them with socks in just above freezing weather~ hence the fit).  Narrow in the toes for tight cracks~ generally good-feeling last and upper. I tried on a pair of Mocc's in the same size and they were off in every dimension for my feet.  I'm actually very tempted to pick up a pair if I can find them reasonably priced in my area.,Dec 2014,Dec 13 2014,0
7983,evolv addicts (climbing slipper),2,13, Defy works pretty good.  Can get a tight and loose pair for @170$. The heel isnt much but these work better than shamans or solutions in many situations,Mar 2004,Sep 17 2015,0
7984,Review: Arc'teryx Acrux FL Approach Shoes,1,0, I haven't seen too many folks on here talking about these shoes~ so I figure I'll start it up with a quick review of my time using them.    Disclaimer: I work for an Arc'teryx store and did get a deal on them~ but damn I love these shoes.    I've owned so many different approach shoes in the last two years. Sportiva~ Scarpa~ 5.10~ the works. All didn't fit my feet in some way or another. Blisters with 90% of them.    When these were coming out and I got to learn more about them~ the more I was excited to try them~ and of course nervous about fit.    I own the basic non-gore-tex ones. Although after this review you'll see why I wouldn't mind a pair of gore-tex.    These shoes are made with a seamless~ clean construction. The main upper is a series of layers of fibers~ individually soaked with DWR~ and another hydrophobic super durable outer. No tongue~ or stitch lines. There's even a micro shank type piece in the shoe to give it some stiffness that won't wear out. No compromise in walkability.    The rand around the toe and the heel is uniquely made for each size shoe~ not just a one size fits all piece that'll eventually delaminate. +1 durability   Arc'teryx uses a unique Vibram sole pattern~ similar to that of the BoulderX~ but slightly different. Mixture of two different types of sticky dots~ great climbing zone~ and the great heel lugs for downhill breaking.    The liner is an incredibly comfortable mesh type fabric that moves very well with your foot. The idea is that your whole foot is covered by this fabric~ like a sock~ so it allows for better breathability with no dead air pockets. Similar thing by having no tongue; increased breathability. In Gore-tex models~ this liner is where the gore-tex lives.    Performance:   I eagerly took these to Rooster Rock~ outside of Portland on the first day I had them. It's a simple 5.4 scramble~ easy downclimb as well. It'd be a good place to become aquatinted with my new shoes. I cranked them tight before the climb~ because that's what I'm used to doing. Right away they stuck to rock well~ held an edge very nicely. I made another trip here a few weeks later and didn't feel the need to crank them down as much~ and I still got the same level of performance.    I'm in the Tetons now for the summer and have had a few long days out with them. Mt. St. John via the east ridge and over all the summit pinnacles~ and a few days later on the East Ridge on Buck Mt.    Conclusion from both of those days:   Wow these things are amazing. They take a strap on crampon very well~ I use the BD Contact. Kick steps well~ and basically handles snow well in all ways a shoe that's not a dedicated mountain boot does. As mentioned I do not have the gore-tex model~ and had some bread bags for the sloppy snow decent. The whole way up going from snow to rock to rock to snow~ they got wet~ but dried out incredibly quickly. Like stupidly quick. I also noticed my socks getting drier quicker and I'll credit the liner design to that one. On the way to Buck I even stuck my foot right through the snow into flowing water~ and no more than an hour later you couldn't tell that it happened.    Both of these climbs involved going from snow to rock and back again~ and every time I did a quick kick to get some moisture off the bottom~ and I was good to go. I noticed no real decrease in climbing ability with wet soles. St. John involved quite a bit of technical climbing terrain~ and never once did I wish I had different footwear on. 100% trust in these shoes. The rubber is great and very sticky~ and they hold an edge incredibly well.    These shoes are also just plain comfortable. I usually go with varying tightness of the laces throughout a day~ and that makes these shoes super comfy on the trail up~ the snow up~ scrambling a ridge~ snow down then trail down. Even after a 11 hour day~ I felt as good as one can after a day like that in my shoes. The only discomfort experienced was when my socks were quite wet on the hike out~ because I didn't put my bread bags on during the boot-ski down (these also boot ski super well!).    The huge advantage of the inner liner construction was that there are no rub spots anywhere on my foot~ because the liner takes that burden instead of my feet. Days where I know other approach shoes would have destroyed my feet~ I had no doubt in these that I would get home blister/hot spot free. New shoe modeling @ Rooster Rock BD Contact strapped on  On top of Buck~ excellent ridge scramble up With a view.    That's a quick rundown of how I feel about them. I really do love these things. I'd say the removable liner Acrux2 is next on the list~ if I want goretex.    Acrux FL~ non-Gore tex: $190   1lb~ 14oz for the pair   Two thumbs up from me. Anyone else used them? I'd love to hear more thoughts! Shoes are a pretty individual thing and I'm aware of the good and bad that comes with that.,Jul 2014,Jun 18 2015,0

8003,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,0, Shoes seem to be discussed a lot. I've been doing a lot of reading but still not sure where to look. Application is~ for the immediate future~ 100% indoor gym climbing as I'm just starting out. Been using the gym's rental shoes (Evolv lace-ups of some sort~ they're green and brown) in size 13.5. My street-shoe size in typical sneakers is like 11.5 US or so depending on the brand. I tried on a bunch of shoes at my gym and none of them really felt good.   I've read that you're supposed to size down a little from your street shoe. But I can't even get my foot into an 11.5 climbing shoe~ let alone an 11 or 10.5. I don't know how y'all do it. The best I found so far is the Evolv Spark in size 13.   I'm looking for something that's comfortable and not super arched and curved. I have wide~ flat feet. And I want something comfortable so I can actually climb and enjoy myself until I start getting better. If climbing is painful~ I probably won't want to continue to do it... I can deal with something that's tight. But if my toes are curled under a lot~ then it's way too painful.   So any recommendations on some shoes to try on? There's like a million options so it's hard to know where to even start.   The Tenaya Amigo look like they might be a decent choice. But I'd have to order them online. No stores in my area carry them.,Mar 2015,Apr 3 2015,0
8004,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,1, Try the Scarpa Force X you should be able to size it your street shoe size or a 1/2 size down. Awesome shoe.,Aug 2006,Apr 3 2015,0

8006,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,3," Some shoes I've tried on are way off from my street shoe size. Try on a bunch and find a pair that's comfortable~ without too much hanging past your toes. Don't worry about any ""rules"" like sizing down a half size from your street shoe size. I wouldn't get stuck on a particular brand or model of shoe.   You want to enjoy your climbing experience? Wearing comfy shoes is a good start.   Edit: Do you have a climbing shop near you where you can try on different types of shoes? That would probably have a better selection than a climbing gym.",Nov 2009,Apr 3 2015,0
8007,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,4," I'm in San Francisco. Only shops here are my climbing gym~ REI and a local sportswear shop. None of them have amazing selections.     At REI now. Trying a few shoes. La Sportiva Nago and Scarpa Helix. If a shoe ""farts"" when you walk/move does that mean it's too large? Like farting with your hand and arm pit.    The Nago seems decent. I'm sizing down in that and I'm at a 45. I think I can go smaller to a 44.5. But they don't have one to try. Scarpa seems ok too but it farts a lot haha.    Still trying more. They have an ok selection but not a lot of sizes.",Mar 2015,Apr 3 2015,0
8008,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,5, At least if you climb in new shoes from REI and they hurt after a while~ you can return them within a year. They do have a limited selection. Go for comfort!,Nov 2009,Apr 3 2015,0

8010,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,7," I agree about going for comfort first. Just a far warning though~ all shoes~ especially leather heavy ones like la sportiva and 5.10~ will tend to break in significantly after about a month of moderate climbing~ usually up to at least a half size (US). Also~ My nagos ""farted"" a lot too~ I think it was a common problem~ but while its not ideal I still really enjoyed that shoe and it worked great (It does make your feet red for some reason). Good luck and happy climbing!",May 2013,Apr 3 2015,0
8011,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,8, If you're looking at the Mythos~ size them a little small. They'll stretch to fit your feet perfectly. They're not a top performing shoe~ but not bad at all either~ and (especially once they stretch to fit your feet) they're very comfortable.,Jul 2012,Apr 3 2015,0
8012,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,9,,Mar 2014,Apr 4 2015,0
8013,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,10," After trying every shoe they had (REI)~ I went with the Mythos Terra. If they ""break in"" and stretch too much~ I can exchange them for a half size down thanks to REI's awesome return policy.   The Nago and Helix were the others that seemed to be pretty good.   For a more aggressive shoe~ the Testarosa was surprisingly comfortable.I think I needed to go up a half size. But they didn't have any to try. So I'm sticking with the Mythos for the time being. I can see myself going to the Nago after the Mythos and then to the Testarosa. Sorta getting more aggressive over time if I stick with it.   Most of the La Sportiva shoes I tried on seemed to fit me better than Evolv or 5.10.",Mar 2015,Apr 4 2015,0
8014,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,11, Yeah. You just have to try on different shoes to see what fits. If they hurt don't get them.  You want snug not toe crushing. Sizing can be a pain from company to company. I originally climbed Sportiva but later found Evolv had shoes that were cut much better for my foot.,Aug 2011,Apr 4 2015,0
8015,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,12, The force x is a much better shoe then the helix from Scarpa. The rubber between the 2 is vastly different,Aug 2006,Apr 4 2015,0
8016,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,13, Though you already got some shoes~ I recommend trying on the LS Tarantulas.  They were my first beginner pair and I can't vouch for them enough.  They preform well in every gym scenario that I've encountered.  For comfort~ top-notch.  My gym had a shoe demo day recently where I tried half-dozen shoes on and my Tarantulas were the most comfortable by a good margin.  Sizing will be as you hear~ try one or two sizes down.  I got mine one size down which was fantastic to start~ but they did stretch~ leaving space in the heel for me to go down another half size or full.  From what I remember of the Mythos is that the lacing can take a pretty long time compared to other laced shoes.  The tarantulas do have laces~ but less sets of them to tighten~ saving time getting them on and off.  Yet another positive note I have is the price~ $80~ $60 less than Mythos.  Enough for a new harness if you don't go crazy.     Just go to REI and try a pair on.,Mar 2015,Apr 5 2015,0
8017,Beginner Shoe Suggestion  Where to start?,1,14," The best shoes are for shit if they don't fit. First and foremost is fit and comfort.    Second~ don't fall for all the hype of the supposed ""New and improved"".   Third~ don't be foolish and buy online. Go to a shop and actually try them on to make damned sure they fit right.   Forth~ if they're not made by Five Ten~ after a few outings send them in to your preferred resoler and have that for crap rubber replaced with the good shit~ Five Ten C4 or Five Ten Onyx.",Oct 2002,Apr 11 2015,0

8032,Good alternative to overpriced Goal Zero Solar,1,1, I've been using that same solar panel and quite happy with it. The same company (Anker) makes pretty good external batteries as well in variety of different capacities which are a great way to capture energy so you can use devices during the day and recharge them at night. I still haven't found a good battery to pair up that allows recharging my camera's batteries.   I would also note that it's helpful to know what your amp hour needs are for a given trip. You might find bringing p[re charged batteries a better option to recharging devices.,Jan 2011,Jul 14 2015,0
8033,Rab alpine bivy or OR helium bivy,1,0, I need to get a bivy fot a summer mountaineering trip. I am looking for light as possible. Both of these are around 18oz. I have no experience with bivys. I would think the Rab would be a little more breathable being 3 layer event. However~ it does not have a pole to keep the bivy off your face. Is this not a big deal or is it worth getting a bivy with a pole to keep it off your face? Also~ the alpine bivy has no bug netting. I have read the OR bivy has a few issues with condensation~ but if you vent the opening around 5 inches it helps. It seems that no matter what the material all bivys seem to have condensation issues. Anyway~ any feedback would be great.,Dec 2012,Jul 9 2015,0

8036,Rab alpine bivy or OR helium bivy,1,3," Yeah~ condensation is always an issue.  I've even known someone who died on a clear night sealed up in a bivy some time ago testing it.  So be careful out there.     Bug netting is real nice if you are ""needing it"".  Poles are really a judgement call depending on how you sleep with stuff in your grille...   My current bivy is an older Bibler~ works okay and has some good features like full strength sling integrated for big walling.  The bug netting is wonky though and let's in plenty of buggers..",Jun 2015,Jul 13 2015,0

One nice big roomy pocket for gear harness shoes a jacket~ whatever and a small brain pocket for snacks~ a guide book~ and wallet phone keys etc. Its perfect for an easy day cragging. Also it's got gear loops and the waistbelt tucks out of the way if you're going to wear it climbing. The material is pretty burly and totally waterproof. The closure is a neat little cinch that is easy to open and close one handed or while wearing big gloves and the brain lashes down with a nice~ metal hook closure so no risk of a buckle breaking or a zipper wearing out and the pack spilling open.    The only downside is that its not as compressable as some other packs and if its not mostly full it gets a bit floppy.,Aug 2011,May 4 2015,0

8053,Pack for day use?,1,14, (Disclaimer: I've been a loyal Osprey fan for a long time~ so I'll self-identify as a fanman)   If it's just a day trip for sport cragging or light trad~ I'm really happy with my Osprey Kestrel 32.   If I'm going to be hauling more serious gear~ I use my Osprey Atmos 65.  I just upgraded to the new AG model a few months ago~ and it's easily the best backpack I've owned in the last 15 years.  If I remove the top compartment~ it reduces the capacity slightly~ but I've never had an issue fitting a full trad rack~ shoes~ harness~ snacks~ runners/cord~ etc.  The sleeping bag compartment in the bottom also fits my rope bag quite nicely~ and there's enough external pockets for all that other random stuff I take.   Both can fit up to a 3L hydration bladder~ I should also mention.   I've also had good luck with the REI daypacks~ for what it's worth.,Jan 2015,May 4 2015,0

8065,Pack for day use?,2,5, Been using the Mammut Neon 28~ which I love. It's a touch on the small side if you have a lot of stuff~ but it works great for me 90% of the time if I don't need a ton of gear for the day. It's also pretty slick looking—I swear I've gotten more compliments on that pack than any other piece of gear I've ever owned!

8066,Pack for day use?,2,6, I see alot of people with little 20-25 L packs with harnesses~ shoes~ helmets~ etc hanging off of them on approaches. Get something in the 30-50L range. I use a 45 L pack for most of my cragging. It is way too big for sport climbing when I am just carrying a rope or draws~ but I can fit an entire double rack in it for trad days~ while still carrying food/water~ harness~ shoes~ helmet~ etc.    If you are just sport climbing~ a 35 L pack will almost certainly be sufficient. Brands like Gregory~ Osprey~ BD~ REI~ Kelty~ and Mountain Hardware abound~ but most any pack you find in that size will do you fine. Get something with an internal frame for comfort. Or don't. Crag approaches don't typically top 30 minutes.    Watch the sales on the outdoor gear sites. People on MtProj are always selling lightly used gear too.

8075,Problems with Miura VS breaking after a few weeks,1,4, Ive owned half a dozen pairs of VS's. On every single one of them~ the first part to give up is the velcro. Either the velcro separates from the leather or the strap tears completely. I do not use these for crack climbing. Sport only. I have managed to get a resole out of each and then relegate the old pair to gym use~ so I've not had any go as quickly as you describe. I have also made minor repairs to get the velcro straps to last though the life of the resole. But I still feel like the velcro tabs are a weak part of these shoes.   In general~ I love LS shoes~ but I feel like they are not the heartiest of shoes. The upper rubber on TC Pros is notorious for peeling off. The velcro on the VS's is weak. Several pairs of Myhtos delam'ed right out of the box. IMO~ great fitting and climbing shoes~ but not built for longevity.,Dec 2009,Jun 29 2015,0

Good question.    Personally~ I do not believe that shoes make a real huge difference in ones climbing ability and feel that MOST of the hype is to boost sales.   But then I can't and never could climb the big numbers~ soooo... And now I will have to be more aware of the VELCRO ISSUES and see what gives.

8103,Mammut smart belay device,1,1, For single pitch sport or trad they work great but it's a bummer to not have the two rope option when you are doing rappels or setting up an anchor to bring up a second if you don't have the alpine smart.  As far as I'm aware you can't put the normal smart in guide mode.   Really depends on your purpose.  I've been using mine for a couple years now and it is a great alternative to an expensive grigri (I got my smart for around $15 which is about what you'd pay for an aperture style device anyways).  That said it does seem to be a lot less reliable than a grigri in biting down on the rope.  This is my preference because it requires your belayer to be more attentive  than many get in the habit of being with a grigri.   Problem of course is I know plenty of people who treat a smart like a grigri.  Not that a grigri is auto-locking either but they don't seem to understand that no matter how many times I tell them they can't take their hand off.   Regardless~ if you use it correctly I really like the little bugger.,Mar 2013,Jun 9 2015,0
8104,Mammut smart belay device,1,2," I have one and I like it for most purposes. It is an ""assisted"" locking device vs. autolocking but I find it locks up quite well when using our 10 mm rope. I have not used it on smaller ropes. It is a little awkward at first to feed rope when belaying a leader but improves with practice. Works great with toproping & for gym climbing. I use it to belay my son~ who outweighs me by 30 lbs & it helps me hold him with very little effort.    I use a BD Guide ATC on multipitch climbs (more versatile~ lighter-can use in guide mode to belay off gear~ can rap with it~ etc) but use the Smart for single pitch stuff and in the gym",Jun 2014,Jun 9 2015,0

8106,Mammut smart belay device,1,4," just ordered the new one as it was on sale on steep and cheap. there are two sizes for rope diameter and i got the smaller one which is designed for ropes 7.5-9.5 -- my rope is 9.2; paying out slack for belaying the leader is really smooth.    there was no ""rope slippage"" that an ATC provides (to reduce forces on gear in the event of a fall). maybe it would be impossible to design a device that could give you just a bit of slippage and then suddenly lock into auto block mode. granted~ i was using a rope at the upper end of the size range for that model. in other words it might give you a bit of slippage with a smaller rope diameter.   i belayed my second up using the auto block like i would with an atc guide with a very important difference regarding where you put your biner. without trying to explain it on here i will say just make sure you watch an instructional video before giving it a test run: youtube.com/watch?v=tw551l0…   if you fail to put the biner where you need to~ it is a huge pain in the ass to bring in slack to bring your second up.   rappelling was really nice because the device auto blocks there~ too. the new model has the ability to do a double rope rappel so no problems there. setting up my prussik seemed kinda pointless.   the safety~ versatility~ and overall ease of use makes it an easy buy.",Jan 2012,Jun 9 2015,0

8115,Mammut smart belay device,1,13, I agree with Bearbreeder completely. His posts are some of the best and contributory on MP~ so take his advice. If you are new to climbing you should be 100% proficient with a normal tube style device i.e. ATC~ BEFORE you graduate to an assisted braking device.    Get an ATC Guide on sale~ it will serve you well for years~ it is more durable than some of it's competitors (i.e. Petzl Reverso)~ and you will never grow out of it. It is an extremely versatile belay device that you can learn sound belay techniques on~ including TR~ lead belaying~ multipitch~ belaying from the anchor~ swinging lead efficiently~ etc~ and these same skills can be translated to more specialized devices like a Mammut Smart~ Click-Up~ etc.,Aug 2011,Jun 10 2015,0
8116,Mammut smart belay device,1,14, I picked up a smart alpine a few months ago when I saw it on sale at EMS. I think it works really well.. It's takes a little bit of practice to get smooth at lowering or rappelling but the assisted breaking is a nice backup. It's become my go to device for cragging.. I still bring the ATC- guide when I go into the backcountry though.    Having the built in backup when rappelling is really nice when you're trying to untangle ropes..,May 2014,Jun 10 2015,0
8117,Mammut smart belay device,1,15," I second bearbreeder.  Learn competent belaying (from above and below) with a tube-style device before ""graduating"" to any of the ""assisted"" braking devices. Doing this guarantees that you will learn the right attitudes and procedures and will have solid transferable skills~ regardless of what gadget you ultimately adopt.     This is most definitely not the case if you start with one of the ""assisted"" braking devices.  These gadgets can and do create a sense of complacency about braking that is not always warranted~ and all require special hand motions that may not be transferable from one device to another.",Feb 2008,Jun 10 2015,0

8120,Helium friends,1,0, Love my C4's but the helium cams are really nice pieces. They are longer and seem a bit lighter.  They do not have as much surface contact for lobes than the C4's though.  Anybody have more expierience with them or have more info for me.,Sep 2011,Mar 7 2012,0

8122,Helium friends,1,2, The cams are good but I really dislike the way WC has sewn the slings. The sling is really tight around the thumb loop.

Read through the other forum also~ thanks for that Ryan~ should have looked harder than i did when checked to see if there was already a discussion on them.   Rafael~ didnt notice about the sewn slings but will definately look at that now.  Maybe just have new slincs placed on them that adjustable but i am good about leaving enough slack in the runner to keep em from walking.

8127,Helium friends,1,7, None of the following is extraordinary in any way~ but in case you were curious about their performance~ I fell on a Helium cam about a week ago.   I took a very short fall onto my Helium 2.5.  The cam was in solid rock and a good placement~ and of course held all 200+ lbs of my racked up weight and did not budge; there was no damage or deformation afterwards.  Interestingly~ someone snapped a photo mid fall~ and you can see the thumb loop deforming (stretching) as it absorbs the weight of my fall.  I never would have known had I not looked at the photo~ because there is no evidence of it on the cam (it sprung right back to its proper shape).,Sep 2011,Apr 19 2012,0

8130,Helium friends,1,10, Thanks Bowens.  Those are great photos that illustrate your point perfectly.  I appear to have been mistaken regarding the contact area of the Heliums vs C4s.   Regarding the sings~ I am just not a fan of dyneema.  I do not think that it is as durable as nylon.  I know that there is nothing wrong with it and that it is perfectly functional.  It is just a personal preference.   Other than that~ the heliums look like great cams.,Dec 2009,Apr 20 2012,0
8131,Helium friends,1,11," Interesting to read the replies. I've been using the new Helium Friends since summer 2011 and love them. They are (1) light~ (2) almost the range of typical C4 camalot (ie a few mm difference in most sizes)~  and (3) the longer stem makes for deeper placements. In terms of ""concerns"" - these are Friends folks - the original cam. Been in use about 30 years and the 13.75° camming angle has been well-proven. C4's are great~ but the new Helium Friends are better. Check out my review from neclimbs.com: neclimbs.com/index.php?Page…",Jun 2012,Jun 1 2012,0
8132,Helium friends,1,12, I got a full set of these and climbed with them a good deal~ but still preferred my C4's.  It seemed that every time I placed one I felt like I wish I had used a C4.     I guess that mostly this was because we were climbing trad lines that were steep and close to my limit or at my limit~ which isn't the best time to learn the sizing for new gear.  Quality gear~ just once I got them I didn't find they were that different from my C4s~ which I had wired for the sizes.,Jan 2011,Dec 24 2012,0
8133,Helium friends,1,13, How much would lobe width really matter?  I would imagine that with most cams on the market~ differences in lobe widths would come down to fractions of millimeters.   Since the force applied to the cam doesn't change~ the difference would come in the area over which that force is applied.  A smaller lobe width would have a smaller contact area~ so the applied pressure to the rock would be slightly higher to balance it out~ leaving the holding power unaffected.     Maybe it's only a problem in softer rocks?  I haven't done any calculations~ but I can't imagine a 0.5 mm difference in lobe width would make a non-negligible difference in the pressure applied to the rock.   Edit: rudimentary calculation   Assume 5 kn generated in a fall   Assume square contact area (not realisticc) of 0.5 mm by 0.5mm   P = F/A = 5 kn / 0.25 mm^2 = 20 kn/mm^2   if we increase the contact area to 1 mm width   P = 5 kn / 0.5 mm^2 = 10 kn/mm^2   which decreases the pressure the rock sees by half.  I suppose this could be the difference between the piece holding or the rock failing in weak sandstones~ although I don't have any rock strength specs immediately on hand.,Jun 2009,Dec 25 2012,0

8135,Helium friends,1,15, as a owner and user of both C4's and Helium friends. I can throw my two cents in. As it has been stated~ Helium friends at the very tips of the lobes are slightly more narrow than C4's. However~ the lobes at around 50% Closure are up to a third wider than C4's in the wider sizes. They are wider than C4's at 50% cam closure until you get to sliver 1.5 which is roughly the same for lobe width as the .75 C4. The one has noticeably thinner lobes than a point five and is the smallest Helium I care to own. Even then the one rarely gets racked. I have better finger sized cams. For fingers I prefer Aliens~ Fat Cams and TCU's. However~ when it comes to lobe width in practice in soft sandstone. more is definitively better. when you climb in Zion you can see cam tracks in most single pitch and multipitch cracks. where units just slid right out of the placement. Nothing is more likely to catch you than a fat cam or an alien. aliens have very wide lobes for most of the sizes they come in and fat cams are impressively tenacious for holding falls of all types in soft stone. They are a trick piece that's pretty much only useful in sandstone~ but that's what I climb and I like my gear holding when I get extra bold and fall farther than 8 feet.,Dec 2011,Dec 28 2012,0
8136,Helium friends,1,16, I have been using my heliums for some time now and really like them. I've taken falls on most all of them. Haven't noticed any deformation of cables or lobes. The 1 is the smallest I own. Really don't care for the action of anything smaller. I go with the power cams for anything under that.Tends to work out good because the powercams tend to be a bit wobbly over the number 3. Use em and love em.,Jan 2012,Jan 6 2013,0
8137,Helium friends,1,17, I got the mid to larger size Heliums to replace my doubles of similar size C4s because I wanted a lighter set of doubles. I'm really happy with these. I agree that the pros include them being lighter~ a bit longer~ and having a nice overlap between sizes which may sometimes eliminate the need to carry doubles. It's also kind of cool that the sizes are a bit different from the C4s. The cons I've heard and read mentioned by others are in regard to the range and the slings. However~ I did not find these things to be a big deal. Although the range is a bit less than the C4s on paper~ in actual use I didn't really notice it. Even tho I agree that the slings are sewn on too tightly~ the springs are kinda stiff. So I really didn't have any problem with walking and most of my placements this weekend were not extended.,Mar 2009,Jan 21 2013,0
8138,Helium friends,1,18, The heliums are great~ I love having both brands in my rack.    To the point made above regarding increased length over the c4's:     pull the trigger on both cams and look at them. The distance from the lobes to your fingers is the same. Your fingers are what determine how far into a crack you can jam the cam. The longer stem in the heliums just results in more stem sticking out of the crack than on a c4~ but the cams are likely contacting the rock at the same depth.    Thats my experience anyway~ Ymmv.,Sep 2011,Mar 21 2013,0
8139,Helium friends,1,19, I'm looking to get some helium friends for my wife's rack but everywhere seems to be sold out on sizes I need or they're way over priced. Any chance people have doubles they want to sell?,Feb 2014,Jun 10 2015,0
8140,Patagonia RPS Rock Pant,1,0," The old ""Rockcraft"" pant was my favorite~ but was discontinued~ this seems to be the replacement.  I picked up a pair and just climbed them at Shelf in it last weekend.  Of course~ those of you anywhere in front range Colorado or Wyoming know that the rain has been a constant problem/distraction~ which is mainly why I chose to post a review...   I'm a kinda skinny guy~ wearing a women's RPS.  In black.   Generalities...   This pant is a very lightweight and stretchy pant~ with a generous cut~ mostly (or entirely) straight leg~ no taper.  Did I say stretchy?  Love this sort of material for those sport climbs where you need to step up to waist level or wide stemming.  Fast drying~ airy for those hot days.  Unlike the old Rockcraft pant~ the cuffs have cinch cords.  They have also added a adjustable system for the waist sizing.   In the field...   The water was flowing through all those riverbeds in Shelf~ which is rare apparently.  We waded across the water~ the pant cuffs with cinches did a REALLY excellent job of keeping the pants capri length.  Since the legs are pretty straight~ I'm sure you could keep the pants up on your thighs if the water was that deep.  I'm quite grateful for this feature because I often opt to wade instead of tyrollean.  There's no hardware for the cinch~ it seems to be done with an internally contained friction knot - very nice and it works.   It rained on us.  See the attached pic~ impressive water repellency for such a light summer pant!  I was super happy to not have wet pants after the rain rolled over.  This is a really thin pant~ the wind before the rain arrived was fairly uncomfortable to experience in these pants.  I would probably not wear these on the mountain if cold winds were possible~ although...I have worn my old Rockcraft pants with the thinnest Capilene underneath~ that worked well.   Under a harness I found the pants very comfortable~ with a very flat fit.   While climbing~ I never noticed that I was wearing the pants~ even for those wide stems (climbing Killer Queen).  I look forward to many summer days in these!  I stopped wearing shorts because of my poor legs - so much shin and knee skin damage.  I see no mention of SPF on the website~ I wonder what it achieves~ and too bad it wasn't designed with SPF 50 or something...   This really is my favorite light climbing pant indoors and out~ primarily because of it's light stretchy design and good function underneath a harness.  Additionally~ it is available available at a price point less than some other climbing pants you might be considering.   And so far~ I have a good amount of faith that this pant will last long enough to justify owning it.  Patagonia RPS rain",Apr 2012,May 25 2015,0
8141,Patagonia RPS Rock Pant,1,1, I also bought a pair of the men's RPS pants~ and I have a few generations of the older Rockcraft pants to compare against. The RPS are nice~ but I've noticed that mine seem to have perpetual static cling. First world problem~ I know~ but it kinda bugs me.   Another minor gripe is that I've found that the pant leg will sometimes twist around my actual leg. The Rockcraft pants didn't. I think that there is a bias created by the articulated design/construction of the RPS that causes this.   And my last nits to pick~ the adjustable webbing slider that is integrated with the waistline button tends to work its way loose~ and the waist adjustment webbing would have been better if it went all the way around. That said~ this is a great feature in principle that just needs some minor tweaks.   Caveat: I design products for a living so I am prone to obsess over details. Plus I am extremely particular when it comes to climbing gear and clothing.    Most folks will love these pants.   Alex,Jun 2011,May 28 2015,0
8142,Tufa Climbing Chalk Bag,1,0, I know~ a review on a chalk bag?! Damn Straight! I came across something about Tufa Climbing's chalk bags roaming around the forum one night and had a look at their site. I guess this all really starts with the fact that I've spent the spring climbing in fear of the wispy loop that holds my windshirt to my harness breaking right before it gets cloudy~ cool and windy (I've been snowed on on Lumpy and Castleton tower) leaving me to shiver (even more) at belays. Enter Tufa Climbing's Houdini bag~ it has a waterproof zip compartment at the bottom that fits a windshirt. I noticed they do custom work too so I inquired about a Houdini with an additional zip pocket for a phone. In anticipation of upgrading to an iPhone6 after I completely annihilate my current phone (I can still kinda read the screen) I asked for a pocket that would accommodate said phone. I just got it the other day and am super stoked about it! It is a little bit long with the bottom compartment and longer upper pocket but it sure beats the hell out of a pack or living in fear of losing my windshirt at an inoppurtune moment. It's still pretty light too~ I have a hand held hang scale that weighed it in at 3.84 oz (110 grams) including the waist strap. While I'm not a seamster it appears to have bomber stitching and is a nice clean design. The phone pocket is wider than a phone as its half the curcumference of the bag so there is no problem slapping an extra bar~ keys or whatever else in there. It also has a loop by the zipper where you could attach it to a harness with a biner. While it's certainly not the cheapest chalk bag out there it's also not the most expensive and it is the most versatile and well thought out I've seen.

8143,Tufa Climbing Chalk Bag,1,1, What the... daaaaaaaaamn! Edit: Can you feel all the crap when you reach inside to chalk up?

8144,Tufa Climbing Chalk Bag,1,2, Yeah~ I mean you can kinda feel the stuff but it's more like it forms a wall rather than an obstruction~ there is still plenty of room~ I definitely don't feel like I'm in any way fighting to get past the keys phone bar to get to the chalk. The pocket is actually a self contained pocket~ not just an opening to the bag on the other side of the fleece where the chalk is held~ also keeps the chalk off your phone bar keys whatever... I just realized I could put some mini liquor bottles in there! Descents have never been so exciting! Could probably fit a good five or six in there if you want to make things really interesting.

8169,Metilous Mastercam,1,0, anyone have any experience with these? What other cams would you compare them to? And advice is greatly appreciated!,Feb 2015,Mar 13 2015,0
8170,Metilous Mastercam,1,1," You're gonna get flamed for this question. Mastercams are so popular; it's like asking ""Anybody use Black Diamond products?""   Edit: Are you new to climbing? That would explain the question.",Nov 2009,Mar 13 2015,0
8171,Metilous Mastercam,1,2, Idk that I've used any Metilous products at all.  I do have a few Metolius Mastercams though~ and they are the duck's nuts.  Never used Aliens.  I have BD C3s and X4s though.  The Mastercams~ in my opinion~ are less flexible than the X4s and more flexible than C3s.  Differences in head width between all of these is negligible.  Solid construction.  I have fallen on a blue one~ but nothing smaller~ though I'm sure they'd hold in a proper placement. They work better in vertical orientations as opposed to horizontal because of the mechanism that attaches the trigger to the lobes.  Good small cam.  Get some~ you won't be disappointed.,Jul 2011,Mar 13 2015,0

8175,Metilous Mastercam,1,6, I'd take an Alien or X4 over a Mastercam. It's not that Mastercams are bad per se~ just that Aliens and BD X4s are both a little bit better.,Jan 2008,Mar 13 2015,0

8177,Metilous Mastercam,1,8, In the smaller sizes~ i have a set of mastercams & a set of x-4's. The x-4's are my go-to pieces but they place pretty similar.

8178,Metilous Mastercam,1,9, Thanks for all the feedback guys~ I'm new to read climbing and I know that c4 and x4 are like the king of the cams apparently so I just wanted to make sure the METILOUS cams were trustworthy and it sounds like they are,Feb 2015,Mar 13 2015,0
8179,Metilous Mastercam,1,10,,Feb 2006,Mar 13 2015,0
8180,Metilous Mastercam,1,11, I like the Master Cams in the small sizes (#1-#4).  I have found that the larger sizes (#5~ and #6) can tend to get stuck easily when over cammed.  I know you aren't supposed to over cam them but many new climbers tend to do so during their learning curve.  The reason seems to stem from the fact that the back of each cam lobe has a curve on the outside edge (unlike BD C4's which are straight).  Also just FYI if you plan on getting into winter climbing get something other than Metolius master cams.  I have personally had them freeze so you couldn't pull the trigger to activate the cam.  This happened to a friend of mine as well and he called Metolius to talk about it.  They offered to exchange all his Master cams for power cams which have a different trigger wire (a 2 stem action).  He has never had an issue since.  All that aside I love my #2 and #3 master cams.  There is hardly a rock route I go on where I don't take them.  I would say they are 2 of my most often placed cams.,Oct 2011,Mar 13 2015,0
8181,Metilous Mastercam,1,12, I climb on granodiorite and love the Mastercam. I prefer Black Diamond C4s for everything bigger than the orange Mastercam~ but love the action and dependability of the Mastercams for little stuff.    My project last year required a purple (0) Mastercam for the crux~ and I whipped on that thing a ton of times and I always felt confident above it. No kinks in it yet~ still in great working condition after five years. The C3s are really good too if you're shopping for tiny cams.,Oct 2009,Mar 23 2015,0
8182,Metilous Mastercam,1,13, I have powercams not mastercams~ but if you haven't heard of metolious then the subtle differences between these two models (both made by metolious) you might not even notice. I'm a new trad leader but surprised others haven't said~ so I will~ correct me if I am wrong. ,Feb 2013,Mar 23 2015,0
8183,Metilous Mastercam,1,14, #1-#3 (Blue through Orange) Mastercams are definitely the thing I like to place most if I'm cruxing. Totally mental~ but they always feel bomber. I have a full set of X4s as well.    Actually~ come to think of it~ if anyone found a yellow mastercam around Moab or estes park last spring~ let me know! hahahah.....,May 2011,Mar 23 2015,0
8184,Metilous Mastercam,1,15, I've fallen on both metolius and bd. I've had both pull and both stay put. It depends a lot on where you climb and the type of climbing you are going to do. I would suggest buying a single set of each.    Walk into any reputable gear shop and ask for an experienced climber that works there. He/she should be able to answer all of the questions you have.

8202,New for 2014: Five Ten Guide Tennie,1,7, Don~   New version:   Better built~ higher quality materials   Stiffer (I mean wayyy stiffer)   Less useful as a climbing shoe~ although they do edge well because they're stiff   Feels more like a boot at first until you break them in   Improved rubber patch at the front for where the old ones blew out   Harder to resole now~ due to the outsole design   Better ankle support   Personally~ I think FiveTen went too far with this shoe and made them too stiff. My old pairs I would climb easy sierra routes in. I'm not sure I would do it in the new ones.    Hope this helps~   Aaron,Jul 2009,Apr 2 2015,0

8205,Scarpa VS La Sportiva Sizing for Mountaineering Boots,1,0, So I have an opportunity to obtain some Scarpa Phantom Guides at a deal I can't pass up~ but no where around me has Scarpa Mountaineering boots. I figured I'd pole here before bothering a rep.    2 Options in my mind   1)Anyone know how close the lasts in say the Phantom Guide to some of their hiking and backpacking boots? There are REI's around that stock those. Or even how different is the lasting from the Inferno to a Phantom Guide.   2)I know my La Sportiva sizing in the Batura 2.0~ Nepal~ and the silver Trango. How do they compare to the Phantom Guide?    Thanks,Oct 2011,Mar 24 2015,0
8206,Scarpa VS La Sportiva Sizing for Mountaineering Boots,1,1, I'll try to answer your question but I am not quite sure as I have never worn Phantom guides.   I'll start out by saying that I wear a 9 (42.5) wide in Asics   I've worn the Nepal at 42.5 and they are super narrow on me.   I switched to Mont Blancs at 42.5 and they are a slightly tight but seem to work really well.   I just bought a pair of Rebel Pro Gtx at 43. The last compared to the Mont Blancs is definitely a bit more narrow but also the shape is a little bit weird compared to the Mont Blancs at least on my feet. I have yet to really go out and test them though.,Nov 2012,Mar 24 2015,0

8237,Petzl Sirocco Helmet Review,1,1, Nice write up Avi~ just one comment if I may.  The helmet is made of expanded polypropylene (EPP) which gives it a lot of its characteristics (weight~ rebound~ etc.).  Polystyrene is found in the Elios and the Meteor helmets.,Feb 2008,Dec 24 2014,0
8238,Petzl Sirocco Helmet Review,1,2, After lots of attempts~ I've been unable to configure the straps so that the Scirocco doesn't flop forward or backward on my head. It's one or the other. A helmet should stay firmly on the head when you try to move it from side to side~ front to back~ or back to front~ or it may be pushed aside by the rock wall or ledge that you may crash into. A bike helmet would provide much better protection.,Oct 2008,Dec 24 2014,0
8239,Petzl Sirocco Helmet Review,1,3, Thanks Arthur!   George~ are you wearing the correct size? I had some success moving the chin straps further forward and tightening the back strap a little.,Sep 2010,Dec 24 2014,0
8240,Petzl Sirocco Helmet Review,1,4, I would agree with George:  took a look at this helmet and couldn't get it to seat correctly on my head while just playing around in the shop.   Especially with impact protection from a fall I expect a good fit and lateral protection~ seems the bulk of this might be prone to catching and being knocked around on one's head.  Will trade a few grams for avoiding a skull fracture any day (and ease of use).   Found the straps to be a PITA~ ease of adjustment being nice if one is adding layers under the helmet.,Oct 2010,Dec 24 2014,0

8242,Petzl Sirocco Helmet Review,1,6, The magnet closure is way too clever for its own good- a solution in search of a problem.

8246,DMM Dragon Cam Review,1,0, I know the DMM Dragon isn't exactly new on the market. But I've read enough flaming comments on the Dragon cam and its comparison to the Camalot that I decided I would do my own review.   I own a set of #2-6 Dragon Cams (couldn't justify the #1 expense) and a set of .5-3 BD C4s. I've taken a few of the comments I've read about the possible negatives of the Dragon cam in comparison to the Camalot and tested them out on both sandstone and granite.   One of the first comments I read was the dislike of the obvious lack of a thumb loop. Many people said they would never use a cam without a thumb loop. My opinion: I love my thumb loops~ but the metal endpiece on the dragon is so large that I think a thumb loop wouldn't have made much difference (in terms of how easy they are to handle~ I'll touch on aid climbing preferences in a minute). There is also a slight indentation in the endpiece that makes it quite ergonomic to hold that the pre-C4 single stem Camalots didn't have. One can also have the option of palming the cam stem~ but I don't do that much. See picture for thumb piece comparison.  Dragon Cam thumbpiece vs BD Camalot thumbpiece   Another problem most people had with the Dragon cams' lack of a thumb loop was the inability to clip high while aid climbing. This was a quick fix with an overhand knot near the thumbpiece after extending the sling~ and I actually found myself being able to clip in about an inch to an inch and a half higher on the Dragon due to the shorter stem and my knot being higher than the bottom of the thumb loop would be.  Overhand knot with an extended sling to clip in higher than with a Camalot   Yet another problem people had with the Dragons were that they thought the way DMM shaved weight off of the cam was to make the lobes thinner~ which would increase the force on the rock in a placement. This is both true and untrue. It is true in the sense that~ yes~ the lobes are thinner~ but untrue in the sense that they are not thinner on the outer portion of the lobes that contact the rock. The thinness comes for the middle of the lobes (where most companies would punch holes in the metal to cut weight. The lobes are the same thickness on the outside but thinner on the interior~ meaning the same force is exerted on the rock with respect to the thickness of the cam lobes(not taking into account the cam angle just yet~ I'll talk about that in a little bit)  Lobe thickness   I read on a couple websites that some people were concerned that with an extended sling a lot of the weight would focus towards one side of the cam because of the twin holes in the thumbpiece. I initially had this concern~ but when I got my Dragons and extended the sling for the first time I saw how this problem was solved. Due to the way the sling is inserted through the thumbpiece to avoid girth hitching~ the sling goes in one hole and exits another~ equalizing the force. See the picture to know what I'm specifically talking about~ it is a little difficult to explain.  Sling spreads the load between the two holes when extended   Now for the practical application. One point that DMM says really shines in their cams is the extendable sling. Now I found this to be either good or neutral. The extendable sling is supposed to be able to save the climber the weight of carry an extra draw for extending a piece. I found that on climbs that don't wander that much~ this is a savior of weight~ I only had to carry draws for my cams that weren't Dragons. However as most know~ there are many routes that do wander. This is where my neutral opinion is. The extendable sling really doesn't do that much for these types of climbs~ and you almost always have to carry an extra draw anyway to extend the piece. However~ it doesn't hinder the climber in any way~ because they'd have to be carrying those draws anyway~ thus~ neutral. See the picture for the length of the sling when extended  extended sling   The 13.75 degree cam angle is another bragging point for DMM~ as they say that it creates a greater holding power. Holding power is a very subjective term~ but it does create a greater outward force. This can be either good or bad for a climber. Like I previously said~ I tried these cams out in both sandstone and granite. In my opinion~ the dragon cams felt more bomber than the Camalots in granite~ but were a little sketchy in sandstone. As most know~ in sandstone the rock gives a lot more than granite~ and the greater outward force of the cams creates a shifting sound of the rock when the cams are weight/fell on. A comparable situation would be Metolius's line of cams~ which have a similar camming angle~ and I've found do almost the exact same thing in sandstone. That said~ I didn't have any of the cams fail when fallen on (however~ the falls weren't that large). The smaller camming angle does give for a greater potential of failing rock in sandstone though. However they will still perform very well in that rock type~ and perform as good if not better in granite than the C4s.   Due to the smaller camming angle~ the range of the Dragon cams is slightly less. But when climbing I didn't really notice this too much~ the ranges are so close it didn't make a difference in placements.   While Dragon cams do weigh less than the C4s~ the weight is not much less~ and with a full rack it's hardly noticable. So in the race between C4s and Dragons~ for the weight aspect I'd say it's a tie. No distinctive winner.   Overall~ you can't go wrong with either cam. Price will be an issue~ but if you're willing to shell out Dragon cams will serve you well. In the largest two sizes they are slightly cheaper than the C4s~ but much more expensive in the smaller sizes. So my recommendation for someone who was looking to save money but still have a quality rack would be C4s up to #2 and then dragon cams (until you get to sizes larger than DMM makes)   PS-sorry for the lack of pictures while actually climbing~ I didn't bring my camera out. Next time I go out climbing I'll take more pictures of the cams in action.,Dec 2010,Mar 7 2011,0

8252,DMM Dragon Cam Review,1,6," It's funny; my findings with the Dragons were almost exactly opposite of yours.     The lobes are most certainly thinner where they contact the rock.  A single fuzzy picture is no way to compare the widths.  In real life~ there is a difference~ and I'm not sure how anyone could miss it.     I felt that they were OBVIOUSLY lighter than Camalots when holding the units and when they were on my harness.  If I were on a big wall or in the back country or alpine environment it would be nice to have an option this light.      I haven't climbed with them so that's about all I can say~ but after handling them in the shop for 10 minutes I decided that I would never own one.  They felt like toys.  I don't see them being as durable as BD's but only time will tell.       How exactly did they ""feel more bomber in granite"" than Camalots?  How did you come to that conclusion?  And how could you hear a ""shifting sound"" in sandstone when you were falling?    What kind of falls did you take on the granite and sandstone?  Did you notice movement/slippage in either medium?  Did they open up at all in sandstone?  What kind of sandstone was it that you were climbing on?   I don't mean to be contradicting your review or arguing with you... I'm just generally curious since we seem to be very far apart in our findings and I've met more than a few people on both sides.  Thanks for your input.       I remember when these first popped up on the net.  They were so hyped but haven't done particularly well in the US or the UK.",May 2009,Mar 11 2011,0

8260,DMM Dragon Cam Review,1,14, I am an engineer and a metal-worker so let's see if I can put this machining vs. forging discussion to bed with a simple question:   For the applications in which we use equipment; would you rather have a forged aluminum carabiner or one machined form a solid block of aluminum?   After reading the comments about inferior quality~ or feeling like a toy~ I went out to my garage and checked my Dragon cams and they seem to be of extremely high quality~ there was no remaining flash evident~ in fact I'm fairly sure they tumble-deburr the individual parts so perhasp a few got through without this process? I find that hard to imagine since DMM is BS EN ISO9001:2008 compliant.   I'll admit that I'm biased in favor of climbing equipment manufactured in the UK~ but I happen to believe that the originators of this type of equipment~ plus the workshop methods to manufacture it should be (as long as they continue to innovate) rewarded with my business.,Jan 2002,Apr 30 2011,0
8261,DMM Dragon Cam Review,1,15, I also looked at these in the shop yesterday and the lobes of the dragon are visibly narrower than the C4 where they contact the rock. That means that the reduced contact area will exert more concentrated force on the rock where it is placed.,May 2009,Apr 30 2011,0

8263,DMM Dragon Cam Review,1,17, I bought a dragon in the .75 camalot size (green) of these shortly before heading to Joshua tree on a trip. I hated the way cam placed so much that I gave it to a friend who exclusively topropes.   I simply couldn't get the cam from my harness to a solid placement in a reasonable amount of time. I'm sure they're really wonderful if you want something to shave grams or if you only put in gear from ledges~ but in my opinion they are poor lead protection when pushing your trad redpoint grade.   My opinion has nothing to do with strength~ it is simply a matter of one handed usability compared to bd c4s. I will not purchase another of these overpriced knockoffs and I would suggest that you don't either.,Jan 2009,May 1 2011,1

8272,DMM Dragon Cam Review,2,5, I find that the metal thumb stud is a step backwards from the coated thumb loop on most modern cams. Also it's bigger than the one on the older c4s making it that much more annoying.   Even if they changed it to a real thumb loop I still wouldn't think the price difference was justified. (I just realized the irony of my stance here~ I'm advocating bd cams because they're cheaper; that's not something I ever thought would happen.)   Yes~ Manlove... It was irritating in highschool~ but has actually been relatively chill since.,Jan 2009,May 2 2011,0

8274,DMM Dragon Cam Review,2,7," Thanks for the review (and comments). I've stated this before somewhere but I own but 2 sets of C4's (not to mention previous versions going back to V.1) and 1 set of Dragon cams. I LOVE C4's and for the larger (.5 - 4) sizes they tend to be my go to cams. I bought a set of Dragon cams last year and have used them a fair amount both front and back country. While the weight savings is nice~ it in itself isn't enough to get me to sell the C4's. The Dragons seem/act incredibly well made and I have no extra perceivable trouble placing them over a like sized C4. Having said that I think they complement the C4 well.    Were I to own 1 set it would be a C4~ 2 sets I'd have no issue mixing them.   As to Customer Service~ the experience I've had lately around the recalled #4 & 5 was stellar. Great communication~ fast turnaround~ extra ""sorry for the hassle"" phantom carbiners.   All is right in the world again.   marc",Jul 2008,May 8 2011,0

8281,DMM Dragon Cam Review,2,14, Does anyone think it would be kosher to resling these with some kind of high tensile cord (like sterling powercord) instead of getting them reslung with 8mm webbing?  Pros/cons?,May 2011,Aug 10 2011,0
8282,DMM Dragon Cam Review,2,15,,Sep 2008,Aug 10 2011,0
8283,DMM Dragon Cam Review,2,16, As far as thinness in lobes:   In an ideal situation~ the lobes load lineally across the contact point of the rock. Rounding the edges~ does effectively reduce that distance~ which in turn increases the force exerted on the lobe/rock surface connection. This is fine in dense/hard rock~ and not as acceptable in soft or insecure rock. Obviously~ DMM designed these cams to accept whatever loads are anticipated~ so structurally there is no difference~ the cam just may not work as well in some sandstone or other soft rock.    Even that is debatable~ the round edge would gradually spread the force across the lobe essentially radiating load into the the stone and (this is without any calculations~ just thinking mechanically about the design) possibly reducing peak impact force in a way that flat lobed cams do not. In reality if you're that concerned about the quality of rock you should either a) run that shit out~ or b) buy some fat cams.   However~ the rounded edges provide a positive in that they are more likely to seat in a groove or between crystals. The rounded edge will push the cam to one side or the other of an unstable placement. This is not likely something that will make or break the cam though~ as any trad climber knows~ real-world execution is often far from theory.    This cam is probably not in any critical way different than a c4. What it comes down to is whether or not you want lighter cams~ with no thumbloop~ and dyneema slings~ or~ heavier~ with thumb loops~ and fatty slings. I personally find myself using the outer part of the loop on my c4's more often than the loop itself so a cam with no loop could be nice. If I see them on sale somewhere I'd probably pick up a couple for long approaches and wide cracks~ both of which I love.,Mar 2011,Aug 12 2011,0

8292,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,5, I've climbed for two years on a set of Dragons that I pair with C4's. I like the Dragons just as much as the C4's - Sometimes more~ sometimes less. Really there's not much difference when you use them. The extendable sling can be nice as a leader and bit of a pain as a follower. Dragons do feel better built with a bit more quality. I don't know if that's the forging~ the stiffer springs or what~ but the manufacturing does seem better.    One great thing about the Dragons is hardly anyone has them so you never have to bother getting your gear back from your partner when you mixed up your racks.,Feb 2012,Nov 13 2013,0
8293,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,6, Not sure how this thread got resurrected from 2011~ but I figured I'd throw my 2 cents in.   I have been accumulating Dragons over the last 6 months or so as doubles to my existing rack of C4s.  I now own the #2-#6. ,Apr 2013,Nov 13 2013,0
8294,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,7, I'd also state that using both Dragons and the current iteration of the Camalots that the Dragons are actually much more durable.  I've not broken a single wire on them whereas I have broken a couple of the Camalot wires and the cams are in much better shape than the Camalots (which seem to be made of a much less durable metal).  On the wires~ I'm always having to re-bend my wires on the current camalot so the action is smooth.  I have not had to do that once on the dragon.  That said~ the new camalots are nowhere near as durable as my older single stem camalots either.,Oct 2011,Nov 13 2013,0

8296,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,9, As someone w a double rack of C4/Dragons I feel like my experience is valuable.   First off I climb in desert sandstone. Generally its a choss party.   I always rack my Dragons on my right and my C4s on my left. I am definetly biased towards placing the Dragons.    I love their aggresive lobe angle. Not sure if this is science~ but they seem to place easier in pods and constrictions. I have noticed that like OP said they tend to crunch the rock a bit when fallen on (only small falls here!)   I also really like the thumb stub for placing. I find it fits real nice on my finger. I also dig the extendable sling~ as more often then not its one less awkward move to my harness to grab an extra sling (I tend to rack my slings separate from my cams)   As for their appearance~ before I bought my dragons a friend showed me the slate Dragon (#4 C4) and I thought it looked like a toy. But now that Ive owned them for a while I think they are fairly durable.   As for their price~ I found a killer deal on them~ that made them cheaper than C4s. I think the lesson here is dont buy full price gear~ thats stupid ;)   All in all I really like pairing my dragons up with my C4s. The small variation in size has come in handy more times than I can count. Why have everything the exact same size? Why not introduce that tiny amount of variation?

8297,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,10, My only issue is going to be the longevity of the sling on the dragons ~ I pulled the trigger on a 1-3 dragon so I can make my own decision wether I like them or not .    As far as anything other then the sling I can see no need to bother worrying about width of the cams or thumb loop or springs ect ect ect . I'm quite sure they will hold up to whatever I subject them to ~ just as my 3 generations of c4s have.  it will probably end up being a situation where I will get dumped when the sling breaks rather then the cam walking or pulling out or some such nonsense .    I can honestly say if it ends up where I have to ship them overseas to have them re slung then they will become very expensive wall hangers ~ set in a spot where I have to look at them every day to remind me why I should never spend good money on another set.,Oct 2007,Dec 6 2013,0

8300,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,13, Dragon cams are super solid.  Been using them for 2 years now.  I pair them with borrowed bd's C4's and both cams slam into place.  I still prefer the dragons and keep buying them over the Camelot.  Partly because it's easier to separate them from my buddies rack.  I haven't seen a single person out in the wild with the dragons.  Good climbing gents!,May 2010,Dec 5 2014,0
8301,DMM Dragon Cam Review,3,14, I've been climbing on Dragons for a while now and have C4/X4s as the other half of my double rack.   (all sizes below are C4~ no need to speak weird Dragon numbers)   I am really happy with the usability and wear on sizes 0.75-2 (I don't own Dragons below 0.75).  BUT~ I've pretty much decided that I prefer C4s in the large sizes blue and grey (C4 #3-4).  Things are getting pretty wide when you're using #3-4~ I find that I can maneuver and push around the larger cams better with the longer rigid stem. Also the big lobes seem to settle better/faster when placing the C4~ I think because of shape of the lobe edges (not so rounded).   Haven't been to The Creek for a while~ but I think I prefer C4s entirely there.  Harder to bury and clip a Dragon in those sustained vertical cracks.   Anyways~ there's my opinion.  Dragons are great in all but the big sizes.,Apr 2012,Mar 21 2015,0

The Katanas returned yesterday with a nice little downturn and much more precise looking shape in the toe. they are better than when I first bought them. If I had thought to ask for this I would have.,Jul 2010,Mar 6 2013,0
8345,.,3,2, Just got my Katana lace back from Rock & Resole. As long as I live around the area~ this will be the only place I'll do resole business with. What sets R&R apart~ IMO~ is they can return shoes back to you as close to the fit/shape of a new pair as possible. I know I've flatten & slightly stretched this pair by climbing thin cracks~ but I was amazed that after the resole~ the toe box almost feel exactly as a new pair would (although experience tells me they'll go back to the more stretched feel much quicker than a new pair).

8355,.,3,12, I've used Rubber Room for years and never had trouble with the time it took~ although I would take the shoes in to the shop directly and they give preference to walk-ins.  They post their shop time generally.  It's not a very big place and they get a shit ton of shoes in the busy season.  Their work has suited me well.   I used Rock and Resole a couple times in the past.  The last time they screwed up 2 pairs of shoes so I couldn't even use them.  The owner was really rude and treated me like I was an asshole for questioning the work~ which was obviously not done well.  Maybe things have changed because that was years ago~ but I won't ever go back there.     Rubber Room!,Jul 2011,Oct 4 2013,0

8357,.,3,14, I've had mostly good luck with R&R. Quick turnaround time (~2 weeks avg~ door-to-door)~ and they do a very neat~ clean looking job. The last pair I sent in to them was disappointing though-- the shoe began delaminating around the instep after about 10 sessions. They'll be going back for a  fix~ hopefully.   I had a pair resoled by Crescent recently. So far so good~ although the job was not quite as neat as R&R's. Still~ they climb well and that's what matters.,Apr 2010,Oct 4 2013,0
8358,.,3,15, Rock & Resole has been great for me.  I've gotten shoes resoled by them since around when they opened up.  I've probably had 12-15 resoles there.  Never had a problem.

8370,.,4,7, @Locker : I'm trying to find out. I remember someone telling me the turn around time through Nomad's was about 3 months so I had always sent mine to R&R. I have a pair of 5.10 Blackwings that came with the HF rubber so I was looking to get them resoled with the same. Otherwise I'd settle for the Onyxx~ but ultimately I just wanted a stiffer rubber then the C4 to keep it a more aggressive shoe.,Mar 2013,Nov 1 2013,0

8373,.,4,10, Your saying the Stealth HF rubber is not stiffer then the C4? C4 rubber is generally the go-to rubber out here in Joshua Tree for slab. Blackwing is a down-turned aggressive shoe. I would imagine it'd be more of an edging shoe thus harder rubber. Right?   Then again shoe rubber is not my area of expertise.

I've had great luck with them. probably 7 or 8 resoles over the last five years on various shoes~ only one of which didn't come out great.   I was having trouble with the sides of my TC Pros blowing out (a design flaw with the shoe~ made worse by lots of jamming)~ and when I brought them in the last few times they told me it was tough to fix. But this last time~ they seem to have come up with a good solution which involves some thick shoe rubber melted over the weak spots. It's ugly as hell~ but it's held up quite well so far. - there was a hole right through the leather on one shoe~ so I wasn't too optimistic~ but after seven days in Yosemite~ three in the Creek~ and a few other days out~ it's still showing very little wear in that spot.,Jul 2009,Nov 1 2013,0

8391,.,5,8, I've had resoles done semi-recently from Plattsburgh Shoe Hospital~ Positive Resoles~ and New England Resoul.  As far as quality goes~ I thought all of them did a good job [see edit below].      Positive Resoles turned out to be the cheapest and had the quickest turnaround time by a full week.   That works for me. Jim    Edit: Since writing this~ the resole from New England Resoul has come undone.  The rubber is fine but top section is delaminating from the bottom section (the toe from the sole) at the join around the seams.  Looks like they weren't glued properly.   This was the second time I have had these particular shoes resoled so take that into account but I have also never had a shoe come apart this bad.  I will try to reglue it myself.,Jul 2011,Jan 6 2014,0

I live in town~ and wasn't in a rush - I dragged the turnaround out to two weeks;  I think they called to let me know my shoes were done about 5 days after I dropped them off.     One suggestion from a friend:  If you live within cycling distance~ pedal or messenger your shoes - parking in the Fremont neighborhood is pretty tough.  If you live within reasonable driving distance of Seattle~ don't.  Mail your shoes.  It will save you time~ frustration & gas money.,Nov 2012,Jul 5 2014,0

8481,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,0, (Post edited 4Aug2014 to correct some sizing info)   I have been psyched on the renaissance of high performance~ all day trad shoes over the last few years – especially high tops and have been patiently waiting for someone else to pen the review comparing all the various high tops out currently. But~ I have slowly acquired all three of the current crop and now have no need of a review so here goes mine. Warning~ this review is LONG-winded and very subjective. I paid retail for all these shoes~ have at least 20 days in all of them and make no attempt at one of those “objective” but boring reviews that drop a lot of tech specs but do not really say anything useful.    Since all gear reviews are inherently subjective and biased~ here is my deal: I am a gear whore who considers rock shoes and ski boots my most important pieces of gear. Been climbing for 25 years and love all types of climbing but really like long alpine rock and ice routes. I have a med-wide forefoot and a medium-sized ankle and prefer stiff and flat-lasted shoes. Started climbing in Boreal Aces and Ballet Golds (how the times have changed that someone could have actually attached “Ballet” to these board-lasted beasts!)~ moved to Five Ten Ascents~ and then have happily settled into the Five Ten Anasazi line for most types of climbing. With the discontinuation of the Five Ten Southwest~ I have been actively searching for the perfect all day trad shoe for the last six plus years. Moccasins fit my foot the best but are too soft for my liking to use outside the gym. Mythos are too narrow and too soft for me. The Anasazi VCS is my all-time favorite shoe but has too much heel tension to wear for more than a few pitches. Hence my long~ sordid journey into the new crop of high tops. Taking the discontinued Five Ten Grandstone and the somewhat dated but still manufactured Boreal Ballet Gold off the list~ the three current shoes in this category are the Evolv Astroman~ Five Ten Anasazi High-Top and La Sportiva TC Pro. Evolv Astroman – Designed in collaboration with Peter Croft~ these “PC Pros” definitively best mimic the appearance of a throw-back high top from Croft’s heyday - in a good way. Of the three shoes~ they are the stiffest~ provide the most support and ankle protection and appear to be the most durable (but I only have 20 days on them); but not surprisingly~ also are the most insensitive. The microfiber lining and the split padded tongue make them the most comfortable of the three shoes for me. I am impressed with the stickiness of the Trax rubber (I am a C4 snob)~ not as sticky as the Anasazi’s C4 but way better than the TC Pro’s Vibram XS Edge – probably most similar to Stealth Onyx = durable and relatively sticky.      They are relatively wide-lasted and have the highest toe profile so thin hands and smaller cracks are not ideal for this shoe. This shoe starts to shine on #1 Camalot-size cracks and wider. They are the best shoe for heel-to-toe jamming in wider cracks since they are so stiff. They also edge the best of the three~ especially after the the TC Pro’s break-in and round down~ these seem to maintain their stiffness and edging ability. Conversely~ they are the worst at smearing or anywhere you really need to feel the rock.  At $145 and durable~ this shoe is value sweet spot of the three. Five Ten Anasazi High Top – Oh~ where to begin my relationship with this shoe? As I stated in the intro~ I am huge Five Ten Anasazi guy (and own more Five Ten approach and Mtn bike shoes than I care to admit; Charles Cole should give me a dividend for the acres of Stealth rubber that I have purchased over the past 20 years). I love the fit~ the rubber~ the synthetic material~ the made-in-America bit and have been longing for Five Ten to finally make a high performing but comfortable all day trad shoe. So many misses in this department for Five Ten recently including the Piton~ then the revitalized but beginner-performing Newton~ then the Grandstone~ and currently the Anasazi Guide. When the specs on the Anasazi High Top were leaked a few years ago~ they seemed too good to be true: C4 rubber~ ankle protection and Velcro for easy off.  Then came an early~ mid-production shift from the original synthetic upper in a garish yellow to a more classic grey leather – for a nod to more comfort. Be still my beating heart~ it looked like Dean Potter and the boys in Redlands had me in mind when they designed this shoe! Unfortunately~ the reality was nowhere near the fantasy.   “Anasazi” is a very confusing and overused model line name since it refers to the last shape but can mean something as soft as the Moc to as stiff as the Blancos or Guides (and the Guides seem to have a much different toe shape compared to the rest of the line). I wrongly assumed that the High-Top would come in at the stiffer end of the spectrum but really feel close to the soft Mocs (or discontinued Piton). I bought them in my normal~ all-day size and they felt sloppy and edged poorly after a quick break in period of a few days. These need to be sized tight to perform well which is not how I want to size an all-day shoe. The three Velcro straps are both long and bulky and make for a somewhat awkward fit because they define where the upper flexes or doesn’t flex (again~ the low-top VCS fit me like a glove). High tops are~ by their nature~ harder to get off at the belays and although the Velcro makes it easier~ the weird fit the straps cause makes me think laces are better for high tops.    They are softest of the three shoes with the best rubber so smear the best. They have a relatively low-profile toe so work well in narrow cracks~ maybe .75 and up. They do cover your ankles but offer the least overall support and ankle protection of these three shoes. If you love the Mocs but want ankle protection~ this could be a great shoe for you. If you prefer stiffer shoes for cracks~ I would look elsewhere. I somewhat assumed this shoe would come and go from production very fast given what I thought was a tiny market~ but REI started to carry them so I am actually starting to see them out and about now. However~ they may already be discontinued based on a quick internet search.  Sportiva TC Pro – This is the shoe that started the revolution and is clearly the sales leader in the high top category. Designed by Tommy Caldwell and loosely modeled on the Muira (I assume)~ this is shoe seems to be one of the most common shoes used by big boy climbers in trad bastions like the Valley and Squamish. Several climbers I know consider it The.Best.Shoe.Ever. If this is you~ I am a little envious but also assume that you may have not owned a really great shoe. Of about every 10 climbers that have used this shoe~ 9 love it and 1 considers it overrated. I fall in the overrated category. But~ and this is a big but~ if I had to climb in only one of these three shoes~ this is probably the one I would go with because it is the best all-arounder – good at everything but exceptional at really nothing except mid-sized cracks.  At $180 and based on my experience with their durability~ this is the worst value of the three.    I was an early adopter of this shoe and bought my first pair within a few months of their release. I was immediately underwhelmed~ to put it mildly~ with the performance of their hard/non-sticky Vibram XS Edge rubber. The idea seemed to be to have a shoe that can stand on small edges without rolling by using a stiff midsole coupled with hard rubber. I would have to go back to Boreal Aces from the early 90s to find rubber that performs as poorly as these. I couldn’t wait to get to my first resole to repave them with C4 but right before I could justify a resole~ the liner split at the seam going up the heel making them unbearably uncomfortable. The rands around both sides of the mid foot also started to delaminate too. Sportiva was great about a warranty replacement but buying the most expensive shoe on the market to have it fall apart before the first resole was a little disappointing to say the least.  As soon as I got the replacements~ I did have them resoled with C4 which essentially made these shoes cost close to $220!   The tongue is a comfortable mesh-covered perforated foam that breaths well~ but other than the tongue~ there is nothing innovative I can see about this shoe. Even after many~ many all-day routes and after my second resole~ I still find the shoe a little uncomfortable probably due to the plain lining but especially due to heel discomfort. A benefit to high tops is~ since they extend well above the heel~ there usually is very little pressure on the Achilles tendon (which is a common complaint against low top Anasazis). I find the sling shot type rand crossing over the heel on the TC pros starts to really hurt my Achilles. The fact the lining stitching goes right up the back of the heel doesn’t help either (which is where mine split on my first pair). Usually I need to take off other rock shoes after a few hours due to toe pain~ but it is heel pain in my comfortably-sized TC Pros that causes me to need to rip them off after a few belays. I am not a fan of the modified Mythos-style lacing where the lowest-most eyelets are missing and the lace wraps around itself which makes replacing the laces such a pain (and a shoe designed for cracks will always need to be re-laced). Also~ since high tops are harder to get off~ a speed lacing system or metal eyelet for the top few holes (like the Astromans) would be a nice improvement. No one would call my ankles flabby (I think)~ but in some positions I find my flesh rolls over the top of the shoe which is really a ¾ top~ not a full high top. I know~ I know that I am really piling on the abuse here~ but the “sage” color just adds to the overall uninspiring package for me – it appears tired and faded when brand new and just gets more sickly-looking with age.    So~ how the hell do they climb? Like the Astromans~ jamming mid-sized cracks is a pleasure. The TC Pros have an impressively low toe profile which make them work well in cracks as narrow as 0.75” – not as good in thin cracks as a Moc or Mythos but still impressive. They are touted as being incredibly good at edging which was relatively true at first~ but I feel the Astromans are a tad better at edging (neither are nearly as good as Anasazi VCS or Blancos – RIP). After a long break-in period~ I feel the Pros became less and less good at edging and the “Permanent Power Platform” didn’t really feel all that permanent meaning they are getting a little sloppy (meaning their performance~ mine still fit relatively tight and did not stretch all the much although others have reported a fair amount of stretching). Although they are “asymmetrical” the toe shape is the closest to being symmetrical (point closest to the middle of shoe) so I feel like my big toe is the least “powered-up” of the three (toe position is a huge part of a way a shoe performs but entirely personal). New and with the original rubber~ they were insensitive and not good at smearing but after resoling and with some break-in~ they smear adequately.  Sizing (all three shoes) – (Note - I originally posted an incorrect size for my TC Pros and edited to correct so posts that follow will make less sense now). This is the question that always gets asked following internet shoe reviews~ so here goes – I am a 9.5 in street shoes. I own a 9.5 in the Astromans but maybe could have gone with a 9. I own a 9.5 in the Anasazi High Tops but a 9 or even an 8.5 would have been better. The 8.5 (41 Euro) TC Pros are still pretty snug but are sized perfectly after a year break in although I wish they were a little bigger for long routes. For comparison~ I am an 8.5 in Mocs (a little tight)~ 9 in the Anasazi VCS and Blancos (performance fit)~ 9.5 in an Evolv Pontas and Scarpa Techno X (both multi-pitch fit). All three of the high tops fit my med-wide foot well. I assume someone with a very narrow foot would not like any of them. It would be hard to differentiate which is widest or narrowest in the forefoot or heel so I will not even try. I feel like the heel fit and the position of the toe in the three shoes is bigger differentiator in these high tops than the volume/width. Summary (and plot twist) – Instead of one of the typical magazine-style “all these shoes are awesome!” assessments~ I feel that all these shoes are good~ not great~ and none are perfect. I kept buying the next high top that came along with the hope of ending the madness and living happily ever after with one. When I got to the point of needing to replace my second pair of TC Pros~ I could not really see myself getting a third pair so I took a sight-unseen shot at the new Scarpa Techno X. It is not a high top but as close as I have found to the best does-it-all shoe out there for my foot shape and it is so comfortable! It has a sweet micro-plush liner and some extra padding above the toe which makes them comfortable at jamming even though they are less stiff than the TC/PC Pros. I love Scarpa ski boots but hardly ever see their rock shoes in the states. Given their lack of market penetration in the US~ the Techno X probably will not become a widely-used classic here but after only about 10 long days so far~ I think the high tops will now only come out on routes with chimneys and off widths and the Techno Xs will be my new go tos on all other multi-pitch routes.,Apr 2014,Jul 14 2014,0

8486,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,5, Your TC Pros are losing their edging ability because they are sized way too loose and are stretching out.  I am surprised they didn't feel floppy after just a couple days.  Everyone I know with TC Pros size them at least 1.5 EU sizes down~ including myself.  The break-in period is long and hard~ but necessary~ and over time they will stretch enough for your toes to fit flat.  TC Pros stretch a TON.,Dec 2011,Jul 16 2014,0

8488,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,7," A big problem for me is the slingshot rand - why do they have to be set so high that they bite into the achilles and then also ""bag"" down on the actual heel? Does anyone really have a heel shaped like this? On flat toe fit shoes I'm not sure there is a real need for an aggressive heel rand at all. On shoes fit very very tight for maximum performance I understand but an all day trad shoe can (and should) be more relaxed and still climb well for all but the hardest of hard men.  Especially on what would be called ""alpine"" routes where one might be wearing socks this makes for an uncomfortably long day.",Jan 2013,Jul 19 2014,0

8491,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,10, Great write-up~ appreciated it.   I own the TC Pros and the Anasazi hightops.    I'd hoped that one would become my all-day shoe for the long stuff I like to climb in Yosemite (ranging from standard fare like Serenity-Sons~ Steck-Sal~ Freeblast~ the Cathedral stuff~ etc. to easier and more obscure stuff on less-visited formations).   After about a year with each~ neither is my go-to for all-day stuff. Just too uncomfortable to keep on for 12+ hr days. I still reach for the Mythos for most long stuff.    TC Pros main uses: anything that I'm going to be heel-toeing on; anything that is .10+ or more and less than 8 pitches; some winter days at the lower-canyon crags. The Miuras used to be my Cookie/Arch shoes~ but now it's the TC Pros because no other shoe I own performs better. The only reason I don't wear them on everything is because after 8 or so pitches~ they hurt if you don't take them off. Not true of my Mythos. I'd never wear these up~ for example~ the Reg on Half Dome. So much 5.9 doesn't really need it~ and I don't suffer at all in the Mythos. I'd never take them to the High Sierra. I'd definitely take them up~ say~ the Moratorium~ where I'd be at my limit and the pitch count isn't too high.   Favorite thing about the TC Pro: The performance. The fit~ for me~ is boner-inducing quality~ which makes the performance that much better. Like a glove. Also heel protection. I lead the Hollow Flake two summers in a row~ the first time in the Mythos~ second time in the TC Pros. The utter carnage made me queezy the first time~ bloodbath; not a scratch the second time (though admittedly I was less gripped and climbing better).    Favorite thing about the Anasazi hightops: still searching for what I like best. Perhaps they haven't broken in for me~ but they are painful after one pitch of climbing. I sized them at my street shoe size. I used them for four or five days at the Cookie + Arch~ suffered~ and have mainly used them at the gym since then to preserve my better shoes. They hurt if I try to use them on anything thinner than a handcrack. Bad toe-box for me. Luckily~ got 'em for about $49 at a Christmas sale.   My twist ending: I'd happily trade any pair of shoes I own for a new pair of Acopa Aztecs~ my all-time favorite all-day shoe~ but alas...

8492,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,11, thanks for the great review   just picked up a pair of TC pros - now I read your review and I'm wondering if I should downsize.  I have a wide foot so it's hard to find a good fit and these shoes fit really nice with no downsizing.   Question:   Once they get worn in~ will I feel too much space in the toes if I don't downsize.  They feel pretty perfect right now but the smaller size means I have bent toes in a new pair.  I'm less worried about some lateral stretching since my foot is so wide.     I already have a pair of tight katanas for when I need that kind of shoe.   thx in advance for any input.    edit:  got most of my question answered in this thread mountainproject.com/v/la-sp…,Jan 2007,Aug 21 2014,0
8493,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,12, Good - listen to what those other people said in that thread - not me!   I sized my TC Pros for all day comfort (used on the Nose~ Grand Wall~ Beckey Chouinard~ ) which is 1 full US size below my street shoe size and after many~ many days they are still a little snug because of the sling shot rand.    Sizing is so important and so personal!,Apr 2014,Aug 21 2014,0

8495,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,14, When you say Anasazi high tops are you referring to the Anasazi guide shoe?   Quick google says probably not. I wonder if that shoe is better.    Also pretty sure I've seen Alex Honnold climbing solo 5.11 in TC Pros so it should say something if a guy is willing to trust his life to a shoe that you claim doesn't perform well. I was told it's a modified katana lace which is known to perform well.,Jan 2014,Aug 22 2014,0

8497,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,16," DOUG: OUTSTANDING WRITE UP! Totally on the money as far as I can tell. I want to add that if you think your Mytos fit like soft silk (mine do)~ the TC Pros may or may not fit as well. They DO NOT fit me as well~ and I have pain in a few my toes. Pretty strange.   Next~ the Acopa JB~ the non-reviewed high top~ gives the Astroman a run for your money on stiffnessand insensitive. Jaybro loves them~ and he's an off width master. Buying the JBs won't make you a Jaybro though. The JB's tend to run small for the size. Note that they are still available used~ and the whispers are that someone is looking to ""get the band back together"" and we may see Acopas again soon...ish.    And as an aside since you mentioned Scarpa~ I have 2 pairs of Scarpa Thunders that fit as well as any all day trad shoe I've ever owned.

8500,Review of Current Crop of High Top Climbing Shoes,1,19, Larry~ I would say the TC Pro made a point of attempting to keep the toe narrow~ and it is definitely more narrow than some of my shoes. It's no moc~ tho~ in terms of narrowness~ and that's why I'm glad I also have the mocs. Also I can definitely recall getting my TC Pros into C4 #1 crack... Granted I climb pretty easy trad~ so maybe the general slabbiness of the routes I climb contribute to my ability to get the toe to work for me.,Jan 2014,Mar 15 2015,0

8537,Climbing Shoe Resole Links,2,14, A note about Berkeley resole:   On September 27th I delivered two pairs of climbing shoes and a hiking boot to Tom at Berkeley Resole. Tom explained to me that they would be mailed back to me in about 2 weeks. I paid $88 for the services.    About 3 weeks later I realized I didn't have my shoes yet so I called (510) 356-7601 and left a message. I did not receive a response so I called again. I left 6 message total over a period of 2 months. I did not receive a call back.     In November I emailed berkeleyresole@gmail.com asking for my shoes to be returned to me in whatever condition they were currently in and I requested that I be refunded. I received a response from Tom saying that my shoes were completed~ he apologized for not getting my calls~ and said he would refund me.    It is now December 27th~ about a month after that email~ and I have not received my shoes or a refund. I would like my shoes returned to me and to be refunded $88.    Update: Today I received one of the two shoes I gave Tom at Berkeley Resole to repair. I also received someone else's shoe in the mail. It has the initials MK on it. If anyone received a women's miura that is not yours I would love to trade.,Dec 2014,Dec 30 2014,0

8543,Edelrid Microjul,1,0," Just got a Microjul. I figured I would start a new thread for this as it's a different beast then the megajul~ and likely has a much more specific use - if you're using this device~ I doubt you are gym climbing or sport cragging.   All of these are comments paired with a Mammut Serenity 8.7. My goal was a device to use with these ropes safely - this includes on 1 rope~ as the Serenity are rated as singles as well.   While I've YET to use it outdoors - still a few months until then - I wanted to get this info out there~ as I really had a hard time finding feedback on the Microjul. The biner selection was surprising. I will update once I get back from a trip to Colorado and put it through it's paces.   Belaying is no problem. You don't need the thumbloop at all. You can push and pull slack just like a regular ATC.. The auto-lock is phenomenal. It would definitely make catching a big fall on skinnies much nicer.   Seconding - it feeds quite a bit easier then the Reversino. I would say the reversino is even borderline too much friction - with a ceiling anchor for testing it was manageable~ but if you had any other non-optimal anchor in real life~ you'd probably get more pumped then you wanted just belaying the second. Lowering a second with the Microjul would be much simpler~ if it had to be done. (Both lock off the second no problem.)   Rapelling - it's great~ and you can always switch back to a normal rap with a prussik. In blocking mode~ using the thumbloop is probably annoying~ but using a biner would be fine. The only caveat might be how hot it the biner ""handle"" gets? I think it's also possible to push on just the wire to get just enough force to lower.   Interestingly enough~ here is the result I had rapping with various biners (complete hanging rap)   Edelrid HMS Strike (RECOMMENDED BY EDELRID!) - does NOT lock off rapping. Some slippage just hanging in the air. I personally would not trust it rapping (vs prussik&non-blocking mode)~ I would just use a prussik most likely.   BD Rocklock - comparable to HMS Strike. Would not trust as above.   Petzl HERA - almost a full lock. I would probably trust it rapping.   Simond Spider HMS - fully locks. Bomber.   So not only does Edelrid have a shyte recommendation for the biner~ it actually performs worse then others.   I think for Multipitch~ it's king - it will excel at holding a fall~ especially bigger ones... Rapping - time will tell~ but I think it will be a great option to have~ especially on a non-overhanging rap.",Jan 2012,Mar 3 2015,0
8544,Edelrid Microjul,1,1," You're on the extreme thickness edge of the MicroJul Specs. (And regardless of what those specs say~ the device was created specifically for 6.9mm twins so I'd argue~ as others have before~ that those ""specs"" are a pipe dream for the thicker ropes)  These devices require the biner bar to enter into the slot in order for ""lock up"" to occur.  Thicker ropes will make this ""slotting"" harder to achieve which is likely what you're experiencing.   My new 8.5s seem too large for the micro and will likely get used with the Mega until further testing can be done.   I consider the Micro a specialty piece for low 8mm and below ropes.   FWIW~ I;ve found the slider and larger (9.5mm) ropes to work just fine in my MegaJul   As more of the assisted ""slot locker"" belay devices come to market more and more people will learn that the biner and rope used play role in effectiveness.   The Click Up and Alpine Up are often pair with a biner specifically for this reason.",Jun 2006,Mar 3 2015,0
8545,Edelrid Microjul,1,2, I would rather be near the maximum rope diameter limit for a device then near the minimum limit.   I'm not sure where Petzl gets off saying the Reverso can handle some absurd range of 7mm-11mm.   The biner fully enters the slot with the 8.7 Serenity. This is not impeding anything. In fact~ the Edelrid biner has a skinnier profile~ and works worse~ then the Simond.   I fully agree ropes will affect how things work - that's why I specified what I'm using it with. YMMW. I have no clue how it will work with skinnier ropes.,Jan 2012,Mar 4 2015,0
8546,Edelrid Microjul,1,3, Excel at holding bigger falls?     Is that from experience or a theory?  Jim Titt showed some test results on the mega jul that showed it did not perform that well with high forces. Not sure how that applies to the micro. Go easy on the auto lock phrase.,Apr 2006,Mar 4 2015,0

8548,Edelrid Microjul,1,5, I have the MircoJul and have been using it all ice season with Sterling Photon 7.8mm ropes. I have the Edelrid Strike biner that they recommend and it absolutely will lock off 100% when used on autolock mode during rappel. To be honest~ I actually it in tuber mode on rappel with an autoblock like a standard atc because it locked off so well. I would suspect mattm is correct in stating that the larger diameter ropes may be the reason for not getting the device to lock up.    As far as the Reverso and ATC Guide being able to handle ropes from 7-11mm~ I actually had to use an ATC Guide to belay with them at one point today and it worked just fine. Also had someone rappel on them with the ATC as well and they had no issue.,Mar 2014,Mar 8 2015,0

8572,day pack for climbing,1,13, Depends on the day~ but I have two packs that are grabbed a lot:   -REI Flash 18 - Short approach with a water bottle~ shoes and small to medium rack. Harness probably on at the car. Partner carries the rope or it goes over the shoulders. Also~ inside the pads on bouldering trips.   -BD Speed 30 - Longer approaches~ alpine routes with outer layers~ anything with snow/ice~ etc. Plenty of capacity for a rack~ rope attaches to the outside.   Next pack will almost certainly be a CCW.,Sep 2011,Sep 19 2013,0
8573,day pack for climbing,1,14, The CiloGear worksacks are absolutely amazing.  I just bought the 40L after putting the 60L though its paces for many months.  Absolutely everything is customizable~ the tool carry is perfect~ and they compress very well (even my 60L can compress down to a workable ~20L).   The standard version is already very durable.  I've hauled mine and chimneyed with it more than a few times and it doesn't show anything more than a bit of dirt.  If you can spring for one of the dyneema versions (not cheap)~ you'll get something even lighter and even more durable.,Apr 2013,Sep 20 2013,0

8580,day pack for climbing,2,0, +1 for the Deuter Guide 35.     I bought one five years ago when I started ice climbing. The packs seen a ton of use and hasn't worn down really all. The pack's dirty and full of black streaks but functioning as well as the first day I bought the pack.    Sometimes I wear the old Arcteryx 16L pack~ one with the drawstring on top while climbing multipitch. Super light and it's held up well too.

8586,day pack for climbing,2,6, I'm looking to start selling bags.  I designed one for multi-pitch that ranges from 10L to 30L~ I haven't heard of any other bag with that large of a volume range.  No awkward bulges from excess fabric when compressed or zippers to break~ fits up to a 3L bladder~ and has a removable hip-belt.  Should easily fit a full rack to hike to the base of the climb then compress out of the way while still leaving space for rain gear~ approach shoes~ water~ and food.  Made to order~ so you'll have to allow some time for me to make it~ you don't pay until I'm ready to ship.  Price is negotiable for now~ this post is my first attempt at selling any bags.

8589,day pack for climbing,2,9, By far my favorite pack for actually climbing in is the dueter speed lite 10.  It's shoulder straps are thin and breathable~ it's got a little pocket that's accessible on the outside~ the zipper pulls are awesome~ super durable~ Delrin rod keeps the back flat against yiur back~ it tapers slightly wider towards the top so it doesn't sag into a blob at the bottom and get it the way.   Very durable and unobtrusive while climbing.  Yeah it's small~ but the zipper opens wide so it's easy to get stuff in and out~ and it's just big enough for water~ approach shoes~ snacks~ and windshirt or light puffy.  If yiu need more room~ get the speed lite 15 or 20.     For a cragging pack to actually carry gear to the climbs~ I've been using the REI pinnacle 35 for about a year and love it.  You could strip it down and climb with it (which I used to do in big mountains with my ol Dana designs sphinx)~ but haven't used it that way yet.  The deuter speed lite 10 fits nicely in it's front pocket too ;),Nov 2013,Dec 29 2014,0

8593,day pack for climbing,2,13, BD bullet is nice but if you're looking to put shoes in there and have large feet you won't be able to fit much else.

8607,day pack for climbing,3,7, It looks like the Pataguchi pack is missing a keeper loop at the top of the pack for a rope... What's keeping the rope from sliding down the 'front' of the pack beneath the hood and strap. It's got a full range of motion in that direction. I think that's what you're talking about Tom... So if it's overstuffed~ the rope is held on both sides under the hood still~ but nothing is preventing the rope from sliding down.   I'm thinking of the BD Axis pack that has the hide-away red strap by the top handle. It wraps around the rope~ through one of the haul loops~ and doubles back to a buckle. this prevents the rope from sliding down the front of the pack.   Edit: What if you were to clip the strap to the top~ and then the hood and tighten from there? That should at least limit the travel of the rope down the front again... Just noticed you mentioned this at the very end~ but just throwing it out there! I was looking at this pack since I've got a coupon in addition to the sale!,Jul 2012,Feb 19 2015,0
8608,day pack for climbing,3,8,,Feb 2013,Feb 19 2015,0
8609,day pack for climbing,3,9, My only other question about it is: how easy is it to get access to when the rope is attached?   My gripe with the BD Axis was since it's a zipped top access~ when the rope is attached~ you cannot access any of the pockets. It looks like there is a small pocket on the hood which is great~ but can you get into the main compartment at all?,Jul 2012,Feb 19 2015,0
8610,day pack for climbing,3,10, The small pocket on the hood is good to have~ but doesn't carry anything huge. You won't have access into the main compartment~ because the rope is sitting on this. It's just really a big open knapsack~ so your rope would be right in the way. But I think you're overthinking this. The Ascentionist~ once you get dialed in using it~ is so fluid that a rope sitting on the opening isn't really in the way. (Pull gray tab rope falls out of way~ reach in~ grab~ put rope back~ pull gray cord~ cinch strap) I really can't imagine any reason why you'd want to get into your bag without moving the rope anyway~ what are you going for insulation? That's a drop bag stop anyway. Other than a partner grabbing a candybar out of your hood~ the minimalist design on this thing means a certain way of doing things. Idk maybe I'm preaching too much~ and maybe although I think this thing is phenomenal~ maybe it's an 'alpine pack' and explicitly not a 'day pack'. I would never need anything else though for a winter outing~ and come this summer I'll tell you if it is a good day~ rock pack.,Feb 2013,Feb 19 2015,0
8611,day pack for climbing,3,11, That makes so much more sense. The way my old BD strap worked~ you had to unhook the whole piece of webbing that was doubled back~ and then try to coax the rope off the top... it was very inconvenient~ but that definitely makes sense.

8615,Petzl Lim'ice,1,0, This is an unsolicited plug for the new Petzl Lim'ice ice-screw sharpener. Mine arrived yesterday and I've just tried it out. If you own more than half-a-dozen screws you should consider getting one~ or make friends with someone who's already got one. Cost is about the same as a single ice-screw. It consists of a sliding file and a guide that holds the screw at the correct angle. Insert the business end of the ice-screw into the guide~ slide the file back and forth~ and repeat for each tooth surface.   It doesn't do quite as good a job as Ouray Mountain Sports with their Grivel machine~ and it takes a fair amount of work if your screw is badly dulled. But it's a great device if you only need to sharpen a couple of screws at a time~ or for light touch-ups. petzl.com/us/outdoor/vertic…  Petzl Lim'Ice,Jul 2003,Dec 5 2013,0
8616,Petzl Lim'ice,1,1, Did it change the bite of that BD Express? Most of my screws are BD~ so I'd be interested to hear how they perform when sharpened to Petzl specs.,Aug 2010,Dec 5 2013,0

8623,Petzl Lim'ice,1,8, Big thumbs up from me.  Put my screws away at the end of last season with lots of dings and dullness.  Sat in front of the TV a couple weeks ago and sharpened 'em all up to factory original sharpness.     Easy to use~ but a bit unwieldy.  On balance~ I figured if I saved myself from having to replace one screw~ it pays for itself.     Recommended.,Jan 2012,Dec 29 2013,1
8624,Petzl Lim'ice,1,9, I picked one of these up a couple of weeks ago. They do not sharpen to Petzl specs! They are closer to the Grivel specs or the old BD. They are great for touching up an ice screw at the crag but that's about it. At the end of the day you turn a new generation tooth angle into an old school tooth angle. Still better than a dull screw but not as good as a professional sharpening job.   Over all it's a good tool for touch ups.,Nov 2006,Dec 29 2013,0

8628,Petzl Lim'ice,1,13," The Lim'ice does NOT reproduce the same specs as found on Petzl screws. Why? I have no clue. If one can get a file and sharpen it to specs on a vise they can surely make a file guide to respect the same angles. Maybe at those angles it's very hard to slide the jig back and forth. Maybe they don't want you to replace the screw often. The tool is kind of clunky to use especially when filing the trail edge and that's the one in question.   Quote from NEice.com iceclimbingforums.com/showt…-(link)/page2 ""The guy at Petzl was very friendly and helpful and noted that my Lim'ice was~ indeed~ working as designed. He agreed that it was sharpening the slanted part of the tooth at an entirely new angle. He said this change shouldn't make any noticeable impact on the screws performance and that sharpening only the very tip of the point was necessary and that the new angle wasn't an issue as long as the tip is sharp.""   He's right to a point. Let me try to explain. What I found when experimenting with different angle is~ the pointier the easier it goes in but wears out faster. To elaborate why the new generation of deeper tooth design works much better at starting a screw. It has to do with how much pressure it takes to sink a tooth into the ice. The old design had a tooth depth of about 6mm and the new ones are about 9mm. Now there is no way you can sink in a screw 6mm at the start in one turn~ not even the new designs. The advantage you get is that a steeper toothed screw will displace less ice and sink into the ice deeper than a shallow tooth. That's before you start to twist it. Once the twisting starts~ each twist will result in deepening the hole more the a lesser angled tooth. It's sort of like an ice pick~ the thinner it is the deeper it penetrates the ice.    So getting back to what the Petzl guy said. If you just touch up the trailing edge slightly~ this should effect the performance only slightly. If you notice the new Lasers have a notch at the root of the tooth. To keep up the maximum performance it would be wiser to file the leading edge more and only remove the burr from the trailing edge. Keep in mind that you should keep the teeth balanced so you need to do all 4 teeth. Not easy to say the least.    Like I said on MP.com it's a great touch up tool to have at the crag but it has it's limitation if you want to return a rack full of basket case screws. Don't throw out your table vises just yet.   As some of you know I have an ice screw sharpening service and return a screw that is sharper than factory. I bought the Lim'Ice and I use it personally at the crag. I have a table vise to keep my screws sharp between my batch runs. Hey I hit rocks too and that's why I started this service. I recommend the new device~ I've seen some of the butchery that goes on. Or better yet ""Give me your tired~ your poor~ your trundled rack yearning to breathe free""   A side note: the Grivel screw sharpener only sharpens to the older shallower tooth specs.",Nov 2006,Jan 20 2014,1

8630,Petzl Lim'ice,1,15, I bought one of these devices recently as well. I used it to sharpen some older BD turbo express screws that were so dulled I wasn't even using them. I touched the screws up and they are now very sharp~ I even sharpened one screw to the point where the tips were uneven by 2-3mm~ it bit just fine in hard ice conditions.   The screws that I had considered good and were in service for leading were like butter knives compared to the touched up beater screws! It works just fine on the newer BDs as well.   I would recommend this product to any climber with with their own ice rack(of BD screws at least).  Maybe they are not the factory profile~ but they come out plenty sharp.,Nov 2011,Feb 6 2015,0

8635,Black diamond guide glove,1,4, Yes~ great gloves for skiing. I'm a wuss from SoCal and they keep me warm when I go to cold scary places. Mine are ~2 years old and have removable wool liners. The leather shell works great alone on warmer days too.   Only con is that there isn't as much insulation on the front as on the back of the hands/fingers~ but that's how it needs to be to keep dexterity high.,Apr 2009,Dec 5 2014,0
8636,Black diamond guide glove,1,5, I've had mine for 1 year and a half. The leather~ as is all BD gloves is great. But they really aren't water proof.  The outer liner is filled with holes from all the seams and has no goretex in it at all. If you want truly gore tex and waterproof-get arc'teryx. On the arc'teryx alpha sv~ the shell is waterproof unlike the BD guide. But the BD guide glove is warmer.    I wish arc'teryx would make a burlier version of the alpha sv with increased insulation and leather reinforcements.    Bottom line-I wouldn't buy them again. I don't generally wear them unless its about 20 degrees or colder and not while I'm real active since they don't breathe the best. Likewise~ i don't find them to be warm enough for temps below zero degrees if I'm not active.,Nov 2007,Dec 5 2014,0

8638,Black diamond guide glove,1,7, I've used them for mountaineering. I think they are pretty good. The outside leather shell is not waterproof~ but the insert is. So~ in theory~ the outer shell gets wet~ but the insert keeps you're hands dry.    I'm between a L and XL~ and ordered the Large. They are snug and as a result the insulation is compressed down. So I think I lost some of the warmth the insulation would provide~ because it's smashed down.   They are tough~ would be hard to cut with an ice ax~ which I've seen happen with some of the nylon puffy style insulated gloves.    I believe mountain hardwear was also making gloves that had waterproof outer shells~ called outdry. It's been a while since I looked.   If you're looking~ the BD rambla glove is still pretty warm and has better articulation.   My two cents...,Jun 2012,Dec 7 2014,0

8649,Black diamond guide glove,1,18, On par with the kinko gloves are the fly low ~ there impreganated with silicone then the whole glove is baked . I've been rocking several pairs of them for a few years now and at 25 bucks a pop idk if they look like  insulated work gloves ~ they work for ice climbing in temps down to 20 deg and if you add a thin smart wool liner and a coupl chem heat packs down to -20 .  I have the worlds coldest hands and feet so take that for what it's worth .   Never again will I spend 70- 200 dollars for gloves that don't hold up to the abuse we ask them to ~ and btw I have the guide glove and it works but is too expensive and too bulky for ice climbing ~ you'll get more mileage out of them as a ski glove .,Oct 2007,Dec 28 2014,0
8650,Black diamond guide glove,1,19, I love the BD rambla gloves~ very durable~ very warm.  No removable liner and probably a bit bulky for ice climbing~ but they are amazing ski gloves.  Now~ if only I hadn't lost them~ doh will be re-buying them in the near future.,Jun 2014,Feb 5 2015,0

8652,Marmot Speed Light Pants OR Greenland parka how's the fit?,1,0, Looking for some fit info on a couple things that will be expensive to ship up here~ so I'd like to get it right the first time.   Marmot Greenland parka— did you size up a size to fit over expedition layers~ or stick with your normal size?    Marmot Speed Light pants— ditto. I'm 195 lbs~ 34x34 pants. Usually find size L too tight in the thigh~ and XL way too huge in the waist. Are these pants fairly roomy for throwing over a softshell pant or other layers?   Sure appreciate the help!,Dec 2012,Feb 3 2015,0
8653,Marmot Speed Light Pants OR Greenland parka how's the fit?,1,1, I got that parka and it for over all my ice climbing layers including the harness.   Bought it in my normal size. It's a great roomy macro-puff that is amazingly light for its size.,Nov 2006,Feb 3 2015,0
8654,Marmot Speed Light Pants OR Greenland parka how's the fit?,1,2, I have the greenland parka in a size XL and its a little bit too roomy on me~ most notably in the body/core. Definitely a warm and packable parka for its weight (and price).    I sized it for a climb on Denali where I expect to have quite a few layers underneath and it works alright for what I plan to wear.  I ordered a L and XL from backcountry and after trying them both on decided to go with the XL. The L was a little bit snug with all of my layers and the XL a bit too roomy. I figured the latter was better. I'm 6'2~ 165lbs.,Oct 2014,Feb 4 2015,0

8658,Mountain Hardwear Exposure Shell,1,0, This will be updated as time goes on.    First Impressions: I got this jacket Christmas Day~ and was immediately phyced. The colors are red and black~ so I am glad to have a brighter color rather than the black raincoats I have always had. Below are the main catagories I will be reviewing.    Waterproofing/ wind proofing/ breathability:   I have only been in the rain with it once~ but when I was~ the water just beaded up and rolled off. I spilled a glass of water on it too~ which again was rolled off.   The breathability is outstanding. Mountain Hardwear really hit the nail on the head here. I rode in a car with heat on with this on~ with no sweating or rise in temperature other than layers below. Wearing it inside the house is unnoticeable~ it is so breathable I forgot I had it on.    As far as wind goes~ I have had it two days~ so no testing yet. Will update Design:   The design of this jacket is incredible. I am amazed at the ease of use of the pockets~ hood~ zippers~ and vents.    There are a total of 5 pockets~ two regular (raised enough to use with a backpack or harness on)~ one left side chest pocket (large enough for a phone with room to spare)~ one right side interior pocket (huge~ enough room for an epipen both horizontally and vertically) and one inside lower mesh pocket (ski goggles maybe).    All are easy to use and perfectly positioned~ with no stuck zippers so far.    The hood is really well designed as well. It has adjustable shock cord around the opening~ with a large~ stiffened visor for no wet faces! It fits over my climbing helmet~ and doesn't feel tight or claustrophobic. The hood rolls backwards and stows comfortably with a Velcro strap with the logo. When the hood is deployed~ that strap velcros to an inside patch~ which does not cause discomfort when wearing.    The double zipper works really well and has not jammed or been difficult to get going~ unlike many other double zipper jackets. The covering is a soluble Velcro fold over thing. It's hard to describe but works well is is 1000x easier than any button type closure.    The armpit zips are easy to use and large. They also have no mesh in them to jam the zippers. They are easy to use~ even with gloves on. The pull is pretty thin~ which is disappointing~ but it could be uncomfortable if they were thicker. However~ this is an unnecessary feature in my eyes because the breathability if the jacket is superb.    Overall this jacket is amazing. I am blown away by the ease of use and functionality~ and I truly love the design and breathability as well as waterproofing.,Dec 2012,Dec 27 2014,0
8659,Bad experience with Just Ropes on Amazon,1,0, Anyone else had a poor experience with Just Ropes on Amazon?  I recently ordered a rope from them and they sent me the wrong color and refused to exchange it.  Normally I wouldn't care about the color of the rope but this one was intended to complete my set of doubles for ice climbing.  The person I contacted about retuning the new and unopened rope was extremely unprofessional and rude.   I would not suggest buying ropes from them and will never make this mistake in the future.  Cheaper does not always mean better.   On a related note I am selling a brand new 70 m Beal Ice Line in Orange.  I will do $100 including shipping to cover my costs and avoid filing a credit card dispute.  Feel free to contact me if interested.,May 2013,Aug 22 2014,0

8662,Bad experience with Just Ropes on Amazon,1,3, It was obvious to me a few months ago that they were just using an Amazon storefront to liquidate the last of the inventory.   I mean~ I had the advantage of knowing what their own website used to be like~ but a storefront offering nothing but two types of ropes and 3 types of rope bags seems like a red flag regardless.    Shouldn't be that surprising that the motivation to be nice to customers would be pretty much gone by that point.,Jul 2005,Oct 20 2014,0
8663,Bad experience with Just Ropes on Amazon,1,4, I agree with Christian~ they used to have an actual website and sell a lot of different ropes.  It hasn't been around for a while now.    I also would give Amazon a call.  They will probably make things right.   E:Well this is an old thread...,Mar 2012,Nov 9 2014,0
8664,Bad experience with Just Ropes on Amazon,1,5, Old thread~ but you can simply call your bank and do a credit card dispute. Most card disputes are adjudicated in favor of the cardholder. Federal law allows you to dispute any transaction conducted on credit such as a credit card. It's a really effective tool for getting your money back when you have been wronged. The key to winning the dispute is documentation. Make sure you save the emails from when you contacted the company~ and if you called get the person's name and the exact time you called. Take a photo of the product and a print screen of the webpage or a copy of your receipt to show you did not get what you bought. It would be an easy win.,Feb 2009,Dec 23 2014,0
8665,Bad experience with Just Ropes on Amazon,1,6, I also bought ropes from them on Amazon and they sent me ropes that were made more than 5 years ago. There is no mention of how old the ropes are anywhere online. When I tried to return the ropes to them~ they just refused~ Amazon wouldn't not help me at all. And I paid with debit card~ not credit card ~ not sure my bank will help with this either. Over $400 for three 5 year old ropes.  Bad company. When I left negative feedback on Amazon~ they get defensive and left untruthful~ accusative reply.,Oct 2013,Dec 24 2014,0
8666,Bad experience with Just Ropes on Amazon,1,7, Even if you paid with a debit card~ you may still be in luck. It covers credit transactions~ which aren't necessarily originated from credit cards. In all likelihood~ if you did it over the Internet~ you did a credit transaction~ even if you used a debit card. I believe the only way to do a debit transaction is to enter your PIN~ which I've never seen Amazon request.   Try calling your bank. Worst case~ they tell you you're SOL. My guess~ though~ is that you're covered.,Aug 2014,Dec 24 2014,0

8669,Gold Big Bro,1,1, I don't think they sold well. Unpopular size coupled with the fact that most popular routes that feature a section of that size can be protected in other ways. Plus~ big bros require a rather specific set of circumstances to place easily and effectively~ so you end up with a really pricey conversation starter~ but not much else.,Mar 2002,Nov 12 2014,0

8671,Gold Big Bro,1,3, John~ let me know if you ever wanna sell that Bro! I'd made an offer.  I don't have my own but I've used one a few times to protect some dicey obscure vision quests.  I agree~ it's a ridiculous piece of gear... but perfectly suited for ridiculous routes!,Nov 2010,Dec 6 2014,0

8673,18v Bosch Drill,1,1, That will do the job and is probably preferred among a lot of back country bolters due to it being much lighter than most drills.

8676,18v Bosch Drill,1,4, Nate~   If you're going backcountry that 18v bosch is a good choice. Its a full pound lighter than the 36v. Mine drills really fast and is a lot nicer to carry in the pack or if you're lead bolting. I've drilled at least 8 holes in hard granite on a single charge on a route with no trouble~ not sure how many it will do before it runs out~ never pushed it that far.   My 2 cents...have fun!,Jul 2008,Nov 15 2014,0

8678,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,0, Gear Review: DMM Dragon Cams and BD Camalots.   Hello there!   I am a full time climber who racks up with singles of 1-5 DMM Dragon Cams and singles of .5-4 Black Diamond Camalots (plus a set of Metolius TCUs for smaller sizes). I have been doing this for the last year and thus have an interesting perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of both cams. Here is a picture ( i.imgur.com/g0oEdsP.jpg )   This is a side by side comparison of the two.   General Ratings:    Dragon Cams 4/5   Camalots 4/5   Categories:   Ease of placement.   Dragon Cams 5/5   Camalots 4/5   This is my favorite part of the Dragon Cam. This is why I ended up racking the Dragons on my right~ and using them as my workhorse cam. Features that I love are the rumbled cam lobes and the shorter stem. The rumbled cam lobes have caught a lot of flack from climbers because they create less surface contact with the rock. My question is~ is this a difference that makes a difference? I climb a lot on sandstone~ and have taken a 30 foot whipper onto a #1 (.5 C4) Dragon~ the rock held just fine. I have taken falls on all my Dragons in sandstone. My conclusion is that the smaller surface area does not make a difference. The advantage to the rumbled cam lobes does make a difference though. They excel in irregular placements.   The other advantage of the Dragon is the shorter stem. The Dragon excels in shallow placements. When combined with the extendable sling the Dragon far out performs the C4. I have no problem with C4’s. They are an awesome cam~ but the Dragon beats them due to minor tweaking in the engineering.   Durability   Dragon Cams 3/5   Camalots 5/5   I used my Dragons as my workhorse cam for a year. The cams held up great~ but within 9 months the sling on my #2 (.75 c4) became compromised and I had to replace the sling imgur.com/8pQ3zjp. I am now a year in~ and all of my Dragons are looking like they will need to be reslung soon m.imgur.com/wfDFgOo. Because of this I have decided to start using the Camalots as my workhorse cam and the Dragons as my backup/alpine cam of choice. The nylon sling on the Camalots is the bees knees. They took a years worth of abuse like a champ~ I wont need to replace the slings for a long time. Thus~ Camalots are the clear winner in durability.    Quality of Craftmanship:   Dragon Cams 5/5   Camalots 5/5   Both of these cams are top quality pieces of machinery. They have great action~ little slop~ and are both made with top quality materials. I appreciate the hot forging process of DMM. It gives them much more freedom in the design of the cam~ and it shows up in the final process. Black Diamond machines all of their cams~ which is cool too~ but not as cool as the Dragons.   Weight:   Dragon Cams 5/5   Camalots 4/5   The actual weight difference between Dragons and Camalots is tiny. The difference between the .5-4 sizes (1-6 Dragon) is like 21 grams or something tiny. They are both pretty light. The advantage of the Dragon comes in the alpine or multipitch climbs. That extendable sling is actually pretty dang handy. I take less slings with me and this equals less weight. Pretty awesome actually :) C4’s are cool~ and pretty light too~ but that extendable sling is the bees knees even if it’s not that durable.   Amount of crap talking you will get for having them on your rack:   Dragon Cam 5/5 (in Indian Creek)   Camalots 1/5   People just love talking smack about Dragon Cams. Especially people who have never done anything except for look at them online or hold one in a store. I have heard some dumb things said about the hot forging not being strong enough~ the craftmanship being shoddy~ the surface area on the cam lobes being dangerous.... I could go on. Hate on the Dragons is strong.   Verdict:   I love both cams for their engineering~ design~ and quality of materials. Going forward I will use my Camalots as my workhorse cam~ and my Dragons as my specialty cam in difficult placements and in the alpine where their extendable sling comes in very handy.   I think that they complement each other well. I love the 1 mil difference in the range. Makes for a slight variation in the rack that racking with doubles of one brand doesn’t get.,Jun 2013,Sep 8 2014,2
8679,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,1, I also own and use both.  Count me as a Dragon fan.  Dragons are my primary~ and C4's are my 2nd set.     Love the extendable slings~ and I also find the Dragons easier to place when wearing gloves.     I haven't had wear issues on my slings yet~ but that probably just means that I need to get out climbing more than I do.,Jan 2006,Sep 8 2014,2

8682,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,4, Thank you. I've seen this idea pop up a few times and it irks me. I had to take the opportunity to set the record straight =).,Aug 2013,Sep 8 2014,0
8683,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,5, I'll add a vote for the DMM Dragons. I also have a full set of the Demons. Same stem and sling~ but a single axle design.    The only drawback that I have found is you need to pay attention to extending the sling. Pull the tacked side. This can be a PITA when first using them~ not paying attention~ and all pumped out.,May 2014,Sep 8 2014,2
8684,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,6, I love my DMM biners and nuts.  I think that they missed the boat with the Dragon and that the the C4 is a better piece.     I am not in the market for any more cams~ but if I were~ I would absolutely buy Totem.  The Totem Cam is by far the best cam on the market.  Period.  No doubt about it.  I was a doubter until I tried them.  After one pitch~ I got it.  Totem is the next step forward in the evolution of the cam.,Dec 2009,Sep 8 2014,2
8685,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,7, Yeah~ the totems look pretty sweet. As for evolution in cams the dragons are definetly not that. They seem to be more of a refinement of the existing standard.   I can't wait to try out some totems though :),Jun 2013,Sep 8 2014,0
8686,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,8, I don't think that you will be disappointed.  The Totems have an amazing design~ beautiful craftsmanship (like DMM) and are incredibly functional.  I have not been this impressed with a pice of gear in years.  They are simply spectacular.,Dec 2009,Sep 8 2014,1
8687,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,9, Hey~ For those of you out there who like the dragon cam's~ how do you transition from holding the sling to holding the trigger/pommel when you are placing the cam. I have a bunch of C4's and one dragon cam (a #6) and seem to struggle more re-positioning it in my hand without the thumb loop.,Dec 2013,Sep 8 2014,0
8688,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,10, SpencerB~   I unclip the cam and either bite with my teeth and grab how I want~ or I hold the carabiner with my thumb and index and flip the cam to my other fingers. Not a big deal.,May 2014,Sep 8 2014,1
8689,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,11, Spencer~ I have pretty big hands~ so have never really had this problem. I just grab it off my gear loops with one hand~ and slide my hand down to the base of the stem. It intuitively fits in my hand. I actually like the thumb tack~ which after hating the old C4 thumb tack~ really suprised me. It's the advantage that hot forging brings to the table.,Jun 2013,Sep 8 2014,0
8690,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,12, Sam Keller~   Are you positioning the cam in your hand before you unclip it from your harness? I have big hands and still have to adjust it after unclipping.,May 2014,Sep 8 2014,0
8691,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,13, No. I just unclip it and slide my hand into place. It's hard to explain~ but it's a very intuitive feeling for me.   I imagine that you do have big hands if the size of your feet is any judge.,Jun 2013,Sep 8 2014,0
8692,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,14, Ha~ went home~ put on my harness~ racked the cams as usual~ grabbed low on stem~ pulled up and unclipped from harness with ease.    Thank you~ Sam~ for making me rethink my technique. I find this a bit more easy. Once unclipped from the harness the cam is perfectly in position in my hand.   Yes~ everything is in proportion~ but it is damn difficult to fit shoes. :),May 2014,Sep 8 2014,0
8693,Side by side comparison of Dragon Cams and Camalots.,1,15," This was posted on another forum~ and I thought I'd include a response here.  Good stuff overall~ but I wanted to raise a few issues:   This is a good review~ but you did leave out one aspect of the C4 - the thumb loops. Particularly if aiding~ they make a huge different. I find them way easier to place in general with the thumb loops~ but they also make it easier for aiding. The wide loops are easier to clip multiple beaners to~ and move your clip point a few inches up. Spread out over the many~ many pieces you put in on an aid pitch~ you get feet higher and use less gear.   You're off on the ethics piece~ though. BD does a good job of sourcing well in china. Every company uses chinese materials. Where does DMM get their slings?  And we don't live in a world where ALL Chinese manufacturing is crap or is unethical. China has the infrastructure~ and is beginning to catch up ethically. BD has done a good job of managing those ethics~ while playing a strong role in local communities.    DMM still sources products (slings) from China/abroad. Same goes for Metolious~ who uses all american made metal equipment. The reality is that China and Asia at large have many products that are no longer made in America for many reasons. Some are environmental~ but many are related to cost. And increasingly~ it's because China has the production infrastructure (hardware~ not just human resources) to create high-tech equipment. Quality companies have moved production (Osprey springs to mind) overseas because it can be done ethically and at a much cheaper price. Osprey could have either spent ridiculous amounts of money building a factory~ or worked with existing factories in Vietnam to do the work at their standards. We are starting to see a lot of American companies doing the same thing.   Now~ I'm not saying that BD is 100% ethical by any means. Disclosure is a good thing~ and companies like Patagonia have done a good job of disclosing certain processes. But don't mistake some disclosures for total disclosure. The same company that ethically sources down from European geese might buy zippers from dubious sources~ or lower end polyester products for their casual lines at cut rate prices.   Lastly~ I leave you with this selection from the BD Policy on Sustainability:   ""Historically~ we relied on this Toolkit and our Vendor Code of Conduct to carry out routine social compliance audits of our partners. This has since given way to our current model of unannounced~ third-party social audits to check in and review how our partners are performing. These professional audits provide a snapshot of a factory's working conditions~ management systems and compliance with local and international labor laws. We use the audit reports to highlight areas for improvement and to create Corrective Action Plans. Like the rest of us~ our partners are not perfect; these audits provide specific direction for continuous progress.""",Jun 2012,Sep 8 2014,0

8712,mammut alpine smart review,1,0," this is for the 9.2-10.5mm version ...   the alpine smart is mammuts new assisted locking device~ based on the smart~ it is different from that and the gri gri/cinch in that there are 2 channels~ so you can do 2 strand rappels with it   ive had the alpine smart since the start of aug~ having used it ~5 days a week since then on everything from multipitch~ trad/sport cragging~ multi rappels~ etc ... i bought it in canmore for ~40$ canadian ... i am neither sponsored by dead elephant~ or a fanboy of their gear~ the device was not provided by those damn elephants either   notes   - assisted locking ... the locking is basically automatic~ though you should keep yr brake hand on ... the catch is no different from a gri gri/cinch that ive noticed ... supposedly theres a softer catch due to some allowed slip~ but i have not noticed this ... i have fallen and caught falls on trad and sport on it   - feeding out rope ... this is good and bad ... if you have a 9.8 or less mm rope~ the smart works wonderfully~ i find it easier to feed than my 1st gen gri gri ... however on stiffer or thicker ropes~ especially beyond 10mm~ feeding can be a bit of a pain ... the way you feed it is by pulling the handle away from yr body and pulling the rope through ...i find more intuitive than a gri gri as yr hand is basically on the brake the entire time ... you rope MUST be flaked out or layed out smoothly~ with my ATC guide i could get away ganking the rope through even if its a bit tangled ... cant do that with this device   - taking in rope ... same issues as feeding with rope diameter ...    - autoblock ... similar to guide or reverso .. however read the instructions as the setup is not exactly the same ... same isues with rope diameter as with feeding out the rope ... lowering off autoblock is still a bit of a pain~ but the handle does give more leverage ... backup with a munter   - weight ... lighter than a gri gri ... it is bulkier than an ATC   - biner ... use a wide HMS biner ... small lockers will cause feeding issues ... also take care that the biner does not turn narrow side up on you ... that can be a pain to correct with the alpine smart ...   - rapelling ... 2 words ... it sucks ... it is not as intuitive to rappel as with an ATC~ definately jerkier ... what you basically need to do if you have shorter arms like me is bring yr elbow to your body and push the handle up/out ... and find the sweet spot ... forget about rapelling on stiffer 10mm+ ropes ... i had to bounce up and down to going ... on the positive side~ i dont use a prussik with it~ even though dead elephant recommends one ... i just hold the strands lightly with my hand if i need to go ""hands free"" ... rappels better with thinner ropes ... also note that you CANT rappel on say a 9.5mm and a 8mm tag line without going single line rap   - lowering ... not bad ... takes a try or two to get used to but no worse than my gri gri IMO   - price ... depends how you look at it ... for a gri gri substitute its cheap at half the price ... for an ATC replacement its expensive at 1.5-2x more ",Mar 2009,Sep 18 2011,0

8727,mammut alpine smart review,1,15," just as an update ... after using it for 2 seasons ...   - it is not a true ""autolock"" ... it is very rare~ but depending on the biner you use and the orientation of the device~ the assist lock may not function ... in this case its basically an ATC for a short period ... gri gris are still assisted locking~ but people do use em for soloing against petzls recommendation~ they lock up better   - if you are sport climbing and dont need it for raps~ im thinking a gri gri is a better choice ... the weight advantage of the alpine smart is offset by the need for a big biner ... for a gri gri you can use a small UL biner ...   - in terms of costs the alpine smart will be more expensive in the long run with extensive use ... the problem is that you need a big biner like a DMM boa that costs 15+$ ... and with daily use the biner wears out in about a year ... gri gris easily last 10+ years and dont wear out the biner ... so if yr climbing daily and dont need the rap~ a gri gri is cheaper after a few years   - although its against zombie elephants recommendation to rap on a single and a half rope ... ive done so without any issues ... the trick is to treat it as an ATC~ that is dont totally rely on the assited locking~ which you souldnt anyways ...    - 2 years of daily use has done minimal wear to the device ... no worries there   - dont use it with stiff ropes ... which means no mammut ropes > 9.5mm .... and no old thick fuzzy ropes ... the diameter isnt the issue~ but rather the handling ... i can use it on Beals and some Tendons up to 10.2mm with no issues ... but any thicker mammuts or maxims dont work very well ... same with gri gris   - if you are always putting seconds in guide mode~ especially 2 seconds~ i highly recommend this device ... its the easiest pulling device ive used on autoblock and saves yr arm muscles on long climbs ... it pulls through easier than reversos~ ATC guides and or even a gigi   - the belay is very intuitive even for newer climbers~ easier than a gri gri IMO ... its a good choice for a first time assisted locking device~ especially the basic smart~ which is cheaper   at the end of the day~ i use mine for everything and keep planning on using it ... but of you dont plan to rap on it~ the gri gri is a more economical choice in the longer run ...",Mar 2009,Nov 25 2012,0

8729,mammut alpine smart review,1,17, I've been using an Alpine Smart since March~ and probably have 100 days on it.  I've done all manner of climbing with it~ including a lot of multi-pitch guiding and taking my AMGA Rock Guide Exam.   I was given this devise by a Rep~ so take my thoughts with a grain of thought.   In summary~ at first I thought it was a little weird~ but stuck with the learning curve~ now I use it almost exclusively.   This thing does need a very big carabiner.  At first I used a BD Rocklock~ but have now switched to Petzl Williams and like it better.  This thing does concentrate the wear in one spot and thus wears out carabiners faster then anything I've ever seen.  I try to flip the carabiner around while belaying in guide mode to spread the wear out.   This thing does lock very well when catching lead falls.  When catching big guys(200+ pounds) on falls close to the ground I've noticed that about  1 to 1.5 feet of rope slips through.  I believe this does soften the catch.  When catching lighter people very little if any rope slides through.  I personally recommend belay gloves when lead belaying~ especially with the heavier leaders.   When belaying in guide mode (off the anchor) this thing is the smoothest of the newer tube/plaquet hybrid style devises (Reverso~ ATC Guide~ ...) I've used.  It is not as smooth as a gigi~ or a gri-gri (1 or 2) but close and far more useful for everything else.   To me rappelling is the best part of this thing.  I'm a big advocate for backing up rappels~ and I love that this thing offers me a reliable lock off without needing to mess around with prusics and extensions.  I can just slap the ropes into the device~ lock the carabiner~ do my double-check and go.  So simple~ just like the old days.  I can even speed rappel if so inclined.  Try that with a prussic back-up.     When doing a full double-rope rappel the extra weight of the ropes hanging done does make it a bit more work for the first 30 feet but then it smooths out a lot.  I do a lot of rappelling in my line of work and this device has definitely made my life easier.  When rapping off 10 pitch+ climbs~ the time savings at every rappel really start to add up~ plus I never have to make a decision about whether to back-up or not.  It is just always there.  I'm surprised to see someone recommending the use of an extension for this devise as I have fond just the opposite.  Since you need to lift the end of the device up and out to start rappelling~ then keep it up as you go~ extending this thing puts my arms in a really awkward position.  It does give you a great shoulder pump though.  With out an extension I find it is really easy to keep the device unlocked throught he rappel.   If I know I'm going to be just toproping all day~ I do still bring the gri-gri.  It is just a bit smother~ more durable~ and is a bit better at the rescue stuff.  Still the Smart is on my harness the whole time.   In summery:   It's not perfect~ it is a little funky and requires a bit of a learning curve for everyone (new or experienced).  It does require a large carabiner offsetting some of the weight savings.  It also wears out the carabiners faster adding to the expense.     If you're just climbing single pitch~ and almost never rappel~ I'd go with a gri-gri 2~ and an ATC for the rare rappel.   For me~ I've found this device to be the best compromise out there~ and an improvement on what I was using before.  If I lost mine today I would by another one tomorrow.,Aug 2009,Nov 26 2012,0
8730,mammut alpine smart review,1,18, Came across this via another thread and thought I'd add some info for others considering this device.   - Many of the issues mentioned in the OP's review are in relation to a rope >9.8mm. They may be legit. I don't know. I haven't used a rope larger than 9.8 in a long time. I think that's the case for a lot of people. If you're using a rope smaller than 9.8~ I don't think you'll experience many issues mentioned.   - bearbreeder touched on this but I think it's worth highlighting. Unlike the GriGri or Cinch~ the Smart relies on a belay technique very similar to an ATC. Rope can easily be fed out w/o letting go of the brake hand. That~ IMO~ is it's biggest selling point. You can hand it to that 100 lb belayer on your 18 pitch climb without worrying as much about teaching bad habits.,Jul 2006,Feb 23 2013,0
8731,mammut alpine smart review,1,19, I have a smart alpine and a sterling marathon mega rope ( free-be from my old Army unit). It's an 11.2 mm beast of a rope. These two work together pretty good once you figure it out. It was a little jerky on belay and rappel at first and feeding rope on lead was pretty tough~ but after a while I got the hang of it and now I have nice smooth technique. Same goes with rappel~ sucked at first~ not bad now. I've used my friends rope which is a 9.2 and my belay went back to being stop and go~ but his belay was smooth. It's yet another skill set to master~ but getting better at certain techniques is part of the fun in climbing.,Sep 2012,Feb 23 2013,0
8732,mammut alpine smart review,1,20, Update on this device.  I've used this for a couple years and I liked it so much I got one from my girlfriend.  The main reason iI got it is that it auto locks for lead belaying with single or half ropes~ top roping~ guide mode on multi pitch (even with two following simultaneously)~ and on rappel with double rope.   Can't say that for ATC guide~ Reverso~ or gri gri which are the most commonly used belay devices.  I never would've bought one except it was recommended by a guide in Red Rocks.  Usually~ the only people I see using them are guides.  I think it's because guides can do everything they need to do with this one device and it's effortless to pull the rope in guide mode even with two climbers (I hated doing that with my old reverso 3).  The only downside is that there is a learning curve on rappelling in lock mode.  The first two times I used it I hated it (especially with a double rope 60 or 70 m rap). It felt like it was impossible.  After just using it a few times you get the hang of it.  Now it's really easy.  My gf also had same experience.  She hated rapping with it for a couple outings.  Now she wouldn't trade it for anything.  This device is lighter~ cheaper~ and more versatile tha anything else out there~ but it seems like it was probably a marketing failure for Mammut.  Mine is scratched up~ but otherwise has zero wear.  Hopefully Dead Elephant will keep making this.  If they discontinue it~ I'll def buy one or two just in case I lose it or it does wear out.,Oct 2010,Sep 17 2014,0
8733,mammut alpine smart review,2,0, one very important note ... it is very hard if not impossible to release the device without a 10 mm or less dyneema sling or a thin cord to thread through the release hole   for the ATC guide and reverso you can release it 3 ways   - biner pump   - carabiner through the hole and lever it   - sling in the hole and release it~ with the proper backups   the biner pump doesnt work very well~ if at all ... and the plastic hole wont take a carabiner ...    mammut has a diagram of pushing up on the lever in autoblock to release the load .... under full bodyweight this doesnt work at all IME at least with thicker ropes   so in self rescue situations you better have a thin sling or cord handy if you want to release/lower off it ...   also the usage of a higher redirect to backup the lowering off autoblock like you would do with a reverso doesnt work too well either as the handle gets in the way ... the only practical solution IMO is to use a munter (or prussik) off the belay loop as a backup when lowering off autoblock   all these things become evident when you practice self rescue scenarios with the device   as to wear ... 3 years of constant daily use will wear the inside plate to a sharp edge eventually ...  smart alpine large version + petzl williams   i doubt the device was a failure for mammut ...its likely the second most popular assisted braking device after the grigri ...   not to mention that there is a sudden rash of companies putting out devices based on the same concept ... imitation is a sign of success and flattery  bergundsteigen ;),Mar 2009,Oct 19 2014,0
8734,South Platte Climbing: The Thunder Ridge and Turkey Rock edition - GUIDEBOOK REVIEW,1,0, About six years ago Jason Haas and Ben Schneider shared with me and a few others an epic project they were scheming: a new South Platte climbing guidebook. I was overwhelmed with the idea~ knowing how much my good friend Pete had poured into covering this vast region. The thought alone of a trying to cram a tome of that magnitude into an already heavy Platte pack was exhausting enough. Logically the answer was to tackle it by releasing it in volumes - Lord of the Rings style. A few long years later~ Fixed Pin Publishing set a new standard with South Platte Climbing~ The Northern Volume.   And now Jason-the-Power-Haas has returned to author the Two Towers second installment of the trilogy~ South Platte Climbing: The Thunder Ridge and Turkey Rock edition~ for only $25. I’d say if the Northern Volume opened the heart of the South Platte~ this new volume takes a peak into its soul. From the die-hard traditional training grounds jamming and camming into the cracks of Turkey Rocks~ to the proud climbers’ paradise of Thunder Ridge~ or running it out up the inspiring and intimidating giant of Big Rock Candy Mountain~ and everything in between; Jason guides you to many of the most iconic and historic Colorado routes like Whimsical Dreams~ Gobblers Grunt~ Is This For Real~ Starlight~ Shock Treatment~ or Childhood’s End. These and about a thousand more routes span the 170 pages. The font size is a little small for my aging eyes~ though you get your money’s worth of information in a compact sized guide to slip into the pack.   All the full-service Fixed Pin guidebook features are standard~ including full-color photo topos – some crags shot at multiple angles~ thorough descriptions for nearly all the routes~ hit lists~ complete approach beta; GPS data if you need it~ and action photos that make your palms sweat. Front and back cover flaps mark your page~ as well as hold notes of your own. Historical anecdotes and essays by several of the Platte’s main players add a crucial touch of perspective. I was delighted to see Cheyney’s original guide For Turkeys Only was heavily referenced to keep its spirit alive. Pete Williams’ account of his and Peter Gallagher’s ascents of Big Rock modestly describes their “small successes interspersed by epic failures”. Kevin McLaughlin’s “Early Days” really captures the changing trend of “secret crags”~ like Thunder~ becoming a shared treasure.   I have been fortunate with many of my experiences in the South Platte~ especially in the early days cutting my teeth at Turkey Rocks~ mentored by some of the locals and Platte legends. They showed me the approaches~ which routes were which and when was the best time of year to climb them~ rappel and descent beta~ as well as stories from the good ol’ days. They gave recommendations for the best routes based on my skill level. I was inspired watching them climb and be reminded to sometimes stop~ look around~ feel the wind on my face~ and remember why we were there. I learned to appreciate traditional ethics and old school techniques along with old school ratings. I don’t know if these kinds of partnerships are fostered any more these days~ but Jason’s edition of South Platte Climbing may be the next best thing.   -Darren Mabe   October~ 2014,Dec 2002,Oct 14 2014,0

8740,Rock Climbing Clear Creek Canyon~ Guidebook and FOREWORD,1,0," Fixed Pin Publishing is expecting to release their excellent new guidebook for Clear Creek Canyon on October 20~ 2014~ Rock Climbing Clear Creek Canyon by Kevin Capps and Matt Lloyd. On sale for $28.95  hereForeword (copied with permission)   ""Unleashed from the Rockies~ Clear Creek rushes down its canyon like a stampede of wild horses. I was captivated by this energy early one morning as I traversed a steep hillside on my way to work on a new route. Above me~ a harem of thirty bighorn sheep lay and watched me pass~ though I was halted. A large ram approached from behind as if he followed me in~ hooves scraping the dirt and tilting his full-curled horns. On the hill~ another found a stance in front of his flock~ gazing down on the contender while the ewes remained still during the ensuing rumble. The warriors rose to their hindquarters and repeatedly charged into each other. Their heads reverberated like the crack of a gunshot~ so close to me I could feel the power of each blow deep in my chest. If only for that moment~ I felt like I belonged with those canyon climbers.   Superficially~ Clear Creek Canyon provides a noisy casino speedway and ski-traffic bypass. However after 15 years of exploring and climbing in this urban canyon~ I was proud to call it my home crag. My memories have the cathartic sound of whitewater rapids~a buzz of a distant rotary hammer~ or try-hard battle cries of fellow climbers.   This was the nearest midweek escape from my white-collar reality. The first tunnel became an event horizon as I drove into the canyon. I felt pulled into each tunnel as if were a black hole~ just to choose my own adventure on the other side from over 50 crags and rock formations. More often than not~ I conveniently approached them in flip-flops~ armed with a rack of draws and a gri-gri~ because they have been tamed for our bolt-chasing pleasure.   You will find that the crags of Clear Creek host a variety of climbing styles as diverse as the composition of its metamorphic stone. Experiences range from first leads to first ascents~ 5.11-heaven to some of the state’s hardest lines. Chase down the trendy clip-ups or discover trad obscurities reserved only for the Clear Creek veteran. Test yourself with benchmark projects or tie-in to a handful of multi-pitch outingsthat will take you to surprisingly extraordinary positions~ exposed scenarios~ and lofty perches high above the water. These are the training grounds for the local weekend warrior while visiting climbers queue for their chance to chalk up for the most sprayed upon classics.   Even with its relatively short climbing history~ every decade since the eighties saw an influx of a couple of hundred new routes~ established by the growing campaign of devoted Clear Creek Crusaders. After the dust cleared~ their rampage yielded some of the canyon’s best and obvious lines.It was the shoulders of these giants on which we stood. Fortunately~ some real gems had been overlooked~ but we had to work harder for them.By scheming shenanigans~ excavating choss~ and stepping off the talus path~ we pillaged our own legacy routes.   My earliest escapades in developing new routes were inspired here. One of which Casey Bernal and I climbed in the middle of winter. Dodging falling ice~ swinging around on a web of fixed lines~ and sharing smokes on the Ashtray Ledge~ we hand-drilled the bolts together. We felt as if we were a thousand feet up even though we were only about a hundred. But we didn’t care; we were young pioneers.   I spent years refining my modern ‘hook or crook’ first ascent techniques~ and mustering good ol’school ground-up courage; doors opened to more self-expression and adventures with great friends. I had the honor to top out with Derek Lawrence after establishing the canyon’s longest trad route as a farewell tribute to our fallen “Big Brother.” I looked forward to Tuesday night at the crag with Dave Montgomery as we continually threw ourselves on our bromance proj’. I dream to someday see a grin from my son while I belay him above the Creekside tyrol. The next generation will hopefully have even easier and safer access to this climbing resource with the eventual addition of the Clear Creek Canyon Park segment of the Peaks to Plains Trail.   Clear Creek Canyon has become a hot climbing destination and a modern guidebook is essential to fully appreciate its unique character and color. This fresh edition highlights hundreds of new routes~ with updated information of the entire stretch of the canyon~ as well as new crags not documented on the Internet. Magazine quality photographs truly capture the canyon’s spirit. Experienced climbers Kevin Capps and Matt Lloyd have not only painstakingly explored almost every route in this guide first-hand~ but have each authored many new high end routes of their own. Kevin’s passion and skill as a mountain guide and instructor is evident with the book’s practical interface. And while Matt is known as a fearless Jack of All Trades~ I consider him a master of the Canyon.   Potential is high for the next generation of aspiring developers and first ascentionists. I am convinced there are easily another couple of hundred more routes locked away in the rugged hillsides and the Crusade will march toward them.""

8745,Dawn Patrol Approach Pant,1,2, Hi Mike~   Thanks for the review! I'm currently in the market~ deciding whether to replace my 5 year old gamma mx pant (which is now fancily branded swiss cheese) with a new one of the same make~ or save a few $ and try out the dawn patrols. 95% of the time~ I'm going to be climbing vertical ice with them. Slightly concerned about the pocket thing~ as I've grown used to throwing a headlamp or an ultralight shell in my side pocket.   More importantly though~ what about the difference in materials? Warmth~ stretchiness~ wind proofness? Arc'Teryx seems to have changed from schoeller to fortius (which I know nothing about). Any insights here?,Aug 2010,Oct 16 2014,0
8746,Scarpa phantom 6000 size 48,8,0, Used for 10 days on denali. I also had ski boots on the trip so never locked these into bindings. They are essentially brand new.

8747,What would you do? ,1,0," Admittedly this is a first world problem Had a terrible experience recently with an online outdoor retailer~ I'll with hold their name for the time being....    Ordered a specific pair of running shoes that I'd been searching for everywhere- they were purported to be out of production so i was stoked to see someone was still selling them (La Sportiva C-Lite 2.0).   Box came~ i grabbed it and threw box in my car without opening- took off for the weekend on a trip with my girlfriend~ planning to do some trail running.     Opened box next day to put shoes on- realized they were the wrong shoe~ completely wrong model.  Without another option~  wore them any way.  They are ok shoes~ but not what I paid for or expected.  Got back~ called the retailer~ they apologized and acknowledged they had the wrong information on their site and did not stock the C-Lite 2.0 anymore.   Rep said send them back and I'll get refund.    When I sent them back a week later~ I receive notification that they are sending them back to me~ because ""their return policy clearly states they wont take back used items such as shoes""....      Called~ complained~ they offered me a discount but were not willing to budge on the return policy.  I feel like i took it up the a$$ now and want to call again and keep bitching~ or complain on a consumer feedback site....  Thoughts?  Should i just swallow the bitter pill~ and take these shoes I don't want... or fight back?",Jun 2010,Sep 30 2014,0
8748,What would you do? ,1,1, I side with them~ 100%. They shouldn't offer you a discount either.   You got a box in the mail and didn't check~ are you insane?   You wore what was in the box~ of course they're yours now.   You don't have a right to complain. You have a right to the price difference~ if any between the shoes. Nothing more.,Oct 2012,Sep 30 2014,0
8749,What would you do? ,1,2, Yep~ it's the rare retailer that takes back used merchandise. This is where REI excels.,Nov 2009,Sep 30 2014,0
8750,What would you do? ,1,3, Likely I've been spoiled by REI- and thus expect their level of service from everyone...moving forward I will continue to keep my business with them~ vs. random online retailers-,Jun 2010,Sep 30 2014,0
8751,What would you do? ,1,4, Abusing the return policy makes us all pay more in the long run.,Apr 2009,Sep 30 2014,0
8752,What would you do? ,1,5, When you first spoke with them on the phone and they told you to send them back~ did they know that the shoes had been worn? If so~ I'd agree with you. If they knew they had been worn and told you to send them back~ and then they would not honor that agreement~ then I would not be happy. If~ on the other hand~ you did not tell them they were worn when they told you to send them in~ it is hard to argue with their decision.,Dec 2009,Sep 30 2014,0

8754,What would you do? ,1,7, Dispute the charge on your credit card and see what happens.    No guarantee it'll work~ but will certainly cost them a little more effort than telling you to f off over the phone.,Jul 2005,Sep 30 2014,0
8755,What would you do? ,1,8, You should not have worn the shoes.,Jan 2001,Sep 30 2014,0
8756,What would you do? ,1,9, they were fully aware of the situation when they said to send them back.  THe customer service girl seems to have been overshadowed by the return policy guy.      It was either wear the shoes or have my weekend of trail running ruined.   Sure i should have looked in the box~ but they also shouldn't have sent me the wrong pair to begin with and should take some responsibility for their mistake~ which they did with 30% refund~ but now i have a pair of shoes I didn't want and I'm out $70.,Jun 2010,Sep 30 2014,0
8757,What would you do? ,1,10, Take the discount and be happy they're even giving you that. They made a mistake that could have easily been fixed~ but as soon as you wore them you took away that possibility. I'd guess that most online retailers don't have any way to recoup costs on returned gear like REI does via their sidewalk sales.   And it didn't come up at all before you sent them back that they had been used?   This doesn't seem like a bad retailer experience as much as a bad customer experience~ sorry.,May 2010,Sep 30 2014,0
8758,What would you do? ,1,11, How can the retailer resell the shoes as new? It's their fault~ sure~ but you caught it before you put the shoes on. Instead of wearing them~ you should have worn your old shoes or~ get this~ done something else that weekend. Or hey~ go buy a pair of shoes full retail at a walk in store and deal with the return later.    You made the wrong choice to wear them.,Jan 2001,Sep 30 2014,0
8759,What would you do? ,1,12,,Mar 2006,Sep 30 2014,0
8760,What would you do? ,1,13, I would suck up the loss. Take the discount and sell them on here~ gear trade or ebay. This way you are not out 70 bucks.,Jul 2010,Sep 30 2014,0

8762,What would you do? ,1,15,,Dec 2009,Sep 30 2014,0
8763,What would you do? ,1,16," First off~ I would have called the retailer when I first noticed the mistake. That way you can get a feel for how they'll behave before you put the shoes on. If they had told you~ ""if you wear them~ we won't take them back~"" then you can make the decision on whether or not it's worth ruining your trip.   That said~ I'm more on your side than theirs. They screwed up and potentially ruined your trip~ they should eat at least some of the cost. I don't know if I'd expect a full refund~ but a 50% refund or something would be satisfactory since there's some blame on both sides (they shouldn't have sent them~ but if you were expecting to return them~ you probably shouldn't have worn them either).",Aug 2014,Sep 30 2014,0
8764,What would you do? ,1,17,,May 2010,Sep 30 2014,0
8765,What would you do? ,1,18, true i shouldn't have worn the shoes.  Here's the deal- I have limited weekend time to spend with my girlfriend who has a kid- we got the weekend off of childcare~ so we went camping and trail running .  waking up in the AM in our tent~ cruising to REI wasn't exactly an option.   I wasn't about to spoil my weekend and hers because of their shitty mistake.     It is what it is- $70 isn't going to make a difference in the long run.  If it were my company i would instruct customer service to make the customer happy- especially if my company was responsible for advertising sending the wrong product to a customer~ and eat the difference to maintain repuation.     The rep who called me back to explain that i wouldn't be getting a refund acknolwedged our previous conversation.  I do appreciate the advice~ seems it's all over the map.   I certainly am not going to scam REI etc... for this.  Maybe i'll sell the shoes here- or maybe i'll  just wear them anyway.     So- it's a grey area- and up to personal preference.  Again- not what I would do if it were my company.  But RockCreek chooses their own policies and which they can bend or not.  They've lost a customer for life~ but hey- they saved themselves $25 in the transaction (likely their discount price from manufacturer- minus the discount they gave to me),Jun 2010,Sep 30 2014,0

8771,What would you do? ,2,3, if you paid with a credit card~ sent the CC company a letter explaining the situation and refusing to pay for the shoes that you sent back.  it takes a bit of hassle but should work.   i completely disagree w/ everyone that seems to be blaming you for the merchant's fuck up.  it is bait and switch~ plain and simple.  you tried out the shoes and gave them the benefit of the doubt~ but they aren't acceptable substitutes.  it's totally on them in my book.,Dec 2004,Sep 30 2014,0
8772,What would you do? ,2,4, I agree with Dylan.  For my part~ i know it was not ideal to use the shoes~ i was hamstrung with only those shoes and wasn't about to tell my girlfriend we can't go running on a rare weekend alone (her passion) because i potentially couldn't return these shoes I didn't order.  It was worth the $100 hit to have a nice running weekend together in the mountains.    It also is not best practices by the retailer either.  I value everyone's input. and I value my REI membership even more (and buying things in person).   I'll move on- and pray for Sportiva to bring back the C-lite 2.0     Cheers~     -J,Jun 2010,Sep 30 2014,0
8773,What would you do? ,2,5, They sold you the wrong shoe - some might even say they defrauded you.    Suppose you'd bought the shoe as a gift for a friend. They would've worn them being none the wiser. Clearly~ the retailer would be solely responsible in this case.    You were in a situation that gave you no choice other than to go barefoot or wear improper shoes (presumably). Some might argue you had no choice~ and that wearing the shoes was the only option to avoid injury or loss~ either through wasted time and travel expenses~ or~ alternatively~ wearing improper shoes in a potentially dangerous environment. It's unreasonable to imply that you have a responsibility to check whether reputable retailers are going to defraud you by selling you a product you did not buy.    Write management and go as high up the ladder you can. Forward the email en masse to corporate employees(if corporate employees exist). I also agree with disputing the CC charge. It might work.

I’m very sorry to hear that you are displeased with this transaction and I do sincerely apologize for the entire issue. You are absolutely entitled to your opinion and entitled to post your thoughts and experiences on public forums such as Mountain Project. We appreciate your feedback~ as well~ as it helps us as a company to modify our practices. But I have confirmed with multiple people in the company that we are going to stand behind our policy of not accepting returns of used items~ regardless of whether or not the item was incorrect. We sell thousands of products on our site and in our stores in Chattanooga~ and from time to time the photos or information might slip through incorrectly— so we take full responsibility for that! In those cases~ we promptly correct the issue~ send customers complimentary return labels~ and give them either a full refund for the returned item or free 2 day shipping on a replacement order. Since the shoes you returned to us were used~ we were unable to accept them~ which is clearly stated in our return policy (rockcreek.com/return-policy…).   Because there may have been a miscommunication about whether or not the shoes were used~ we made an exception and gave you a 40% discount on them. If you would like to order anything else in the future I can give you a $15 off coupon code and free 2 day shipping. As far as returning these shoes~ we will still be unable to accept them. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you.   Please let me know if you have any other questions~ concerns~ or want to give us any other feedback~ as I would be more than happy to hear it. Also~ if you would like to give me a call at 1-888-707-6708~ I would be more than happy to discuss this with you. Thank you again and I hope have a nice day.,Jun 2010,Sep 30 2014,0

8815,Review on BD Cold Forge Hoody,1,0, I am interested in purchasing the Black Diamond Cold Forge Hoody: blackdiamondequipment.com/e…   Does anyone have experience with this jacket or similar? I live in the upper peninsula of Michigan where it gets in the negatives during the winter and I'm looking for an extremely warm jacket. I don't understand the primaloft system of synthetic down. Also if anyone could compare to how much down this could be in warmth since synthetic is a little different.    Also those who have had experience in synthetic down jackets~ how long do they actually last? Since everyone says Synthetic doesn't last as long as natural down~ i'm really wondering how long they last.    It's hard to judge something that you can't see or try.   Thank You,Sep 2014,Sep 8 2014,0
8816,Review on BD Cold Forge Hoody,1,1," From my understanding~ and this comes from the PrimaLoft website~ PrimaLoft is still producing a fully-synthetic option.  It used to be PrimaLoft One~ but they re-named it to PrimaLoft Gold.  Now~ they are producing what you described as a synthetic-down mix.  Again~ from the PrimaLoft website~ it is my understanding that if the garment is a synthetic/down blend~ the fill will be described as ""PrimaLoft Gold Down Blend.""   As far as durability and longevity goes~ I doubt your going to find many reviews.  It is a new technology that PrimaLoft has developed and recently released.  For what it's worth~ I have several PrimaLoft One products and they have endured their fair share of abuse and came back for more.

8817,Review on BD Cold Forge Hoody,1,2, How's the warmth with the primaloft one jacket? I'm not to familiar with down jackets. When I look at the BD jacket it looks a little thin to keep very warm. But I wouldn't really know.,Sep 2014,Sep 8 2014,0

8819,Review on BD Cold Forge Hoody,1,4," To get a better idea if the jacket will suit your needs~ you need to tell us what your using it for.  Will its main purpose be for belaying while on ice/alpine~ as a mid-layer or just a general around-town winter jacket?   The Cold Forge is definitely going to be warm~ but not as warm as you may think.  Unfortunately~ Black Diamond is not listing the PrimaLoft Gold Down Blend fill weight.  Obviously~ the higher the fill weight~ the warmer the jacket.  Since this is a down styled jacket~ you want to pay attention to the baffling Black Diamond uses.  Baffles keep the down from ""shifting"" out of place.  This piece appears to have ""sewn through"" baffling~ which means it's not as warm as a jacket with ""box"" baffling.   Honestly though~ elaborate what your plans are for this jacket and we can advise on whether this may fulfill your demands.",Mar 2011,Sep 9 2014,0

8821,Review on BD Cold Forge Hoody,1,6, why not try something down? They are super warm and that is something you can easily find in a store to try on..just my opinion. I bought a down jacket that I use to belay in and wear around in the winter months in new england and it's super warm and packs about to about the size of a nalgene,May 2013,Sep 9 2014,0
8822,Lowa Weisshorn,1,0, Just looking for any reviews of the Lowa Weisshorn. Looking for any info on comfort~ warmth~ and durability while hiking~ snow climbing~ and ice climbing. Anything about sizing would be great as well.,Jun 2013,Sep 6 2014,0
8823,Lowa Weisshorn,1,1, Hi William--   I've had a pair of the Weisshorn for a couple years now and LOVE EM.  elevationoutdoors.com/the-l…   Warm~ climb hard enough~ walk well...really a great boot. Realize~ though~ it's lasted a bit differently than a narrower Sportiva-type boot. Fits a wider~ flatter foot~ for sure...I've had a bootfitter buddy of mine help me dial my pair in...and it took relatively little monkeying about...and they are my favorite insulated boot that I've worn. Vastly superior to my old Nepal Extremes...haven't worn a SCARPA mont blanc....so I can't compare.    Anwyay~ I've led 5.8 in them~ easy WI5~ walked hours and hours~ spent seven hours on a route at 13~000 feet and totally warm...   Great boot~ for sure. Love 'em. If you have a narrower~ low-volume foot~ though~ try 'em on first~ make sure they'll work. Good luck~ buddy!    RC,Sep 2009,Sep 6 2014,0
8824,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,0, I've been wanting a new pack for a while and have been eying the Miura 50~ but it's price keeps turning me away (and the used ones that have popped up aren't my size). I recently stumbled across the Mammut Neon 45~ however~ and it's compelling in it's own right~ especially since it's $85 less than the Miura. Some things don't seem that great though...the lack of compression straps and the poor excuse for a waist strap seems like it might make it less suitable for longer approaches. I haven't seen either in person...partly because I've been busy to track them down~ and partly because I'm lazy.   Also~ in case it matters~ I'd be using it for both sport and trad climbing w/ full rack. Approaches up to however long some of the approaches get around here (probably not much longer than Sundance at Lumpy~ though I've only been living in CO for <3 months so maybe something longer?). I've never done alpine and might be interested in that soon~ but for now we'll just assume no alpine.   For those of you that haven't seen this pack at all~ there's a decent little video on REI's website (link under the pictures):  rei.com/product/798183/mamm…   So~ anybody have any experience with it? Even better would be if somebody has used the Miura too and can compare both~ but I'll take what I get.,May 2010,Aug 8 2011,0
8825,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,1, I have on and I like it~ its a tough functional rival of the Miura 50. it loads great carries well and hold my whole rack and a rope plus all my other stuff. the waist strap...yep garbage. as is the racking loop on the inside~ too small. it looks like an after thought. I am not going to lie though the Miura is a way better pack~ much more thoughtfully designed. I personally Like my Neon Gear but if i had the money I would have bought the  Miura. the neon has some nice features its lighter the straps are nicely contoured and the the rope tarp it comes with is a tad small but works well. all in all you could get whatever and it really wouldn't matter,Dec 2011,Jan 9 2012,0
8826,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,2, Looks sleek~ also check out the Mammut Trion Guide.  A partner of mine has it~ and I'm jealous!,Jul 2010,Jan 9 2012,0
8827,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,3, Put a double rack~ a rope~ a gallon of water~ clothes~ and food in that Mammut pack and let me know how that works out for you.,Jul 2010,Jan 9 2012,0
8828,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,4," Seems to me it's more of a Gym/ Sport bag than a mountaineering/ climbing pack. That being said if I had the cash I probably would get one to compliment my Mammute Guide (which I love).   My friend owns the ""previous generation"" of this bag and he really digs in. He doesn't do much trad stuff but it works for him.",Oct 2011,Jan 9 2012,0
8829,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,5, I have the Miura 30 and I love it.  Honestly 95% of reviews on REI are complete shit.  I think the pack looks pretty slick but the gear loop inside of the pack is completely ridiculous.  You could maybe hold 8 draws at the most.     +1 for the Miura Series   Completely bomber durability and design,Dec 2011,Jan 9 2012,0
8830,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,6, I'd get something with a better suspension and maybe more capacity if you are going to be carrying a rack and rope plus food and water~ raingear~ etc for long trad days. The Neon pack looks pretty small for a 44L pack and looks to be designed for gym/sport climbing where all you need is a rope~ draws and a pair of shoes. You will want a bigger pack with a better suspension~ compression straps~ etc for longer approaches with more gear. Some sort of external rope carry system is nice too. I like top-loaders as you can carry more if you need to overstuff them.,May 2011,Jan 11 2012,0
8831,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,7, I got the Spindrift by Mammut~ for both climbing & skiing and it's a great pack~ very comfortable and roomy. I've had it on a few trips and it stands up well to abuse~ carrying a full rack~ rope~ food etc. It's also got a handy side-access zipper. I got it from Backcountry - tinyurl.com/2af4q7n,Jan 2010,Jan 11 2012,0
8832,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,8, i woud say this would work  pack will work for about 90% of the rock out there. i have put my 60m 9.8 a double rack from 0-3(BD) with a 4 thrown in~ with water and food in there and still had some room left for odds and ends.  that being said this will not work well for Multi-pitiching~ big walling or alpine~ and would probably be a huge pain in the ass on a long approach. (read several days)  but for an average climber its going to work great and cost less. its a win in my book and way better than my last pack a BD 50 cal which annoyed the living shit out of me. it has almost the same space with much more usable space. I even use the gear loop thing~ to hold a few small items that are easy pushed to the bottom. such as my GriGri. I have only used it for single pith climbing so far so I cant speak as to its pros and cons on larger walls. who knows it might be great.,Dec 2011,Jan 15 2012,0
8833,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,9," I got this pack to replace my old CiloGear pack that was a POS. In general I like it. I looked at the Miura~ but could not justify spending more on my pack than any other single piece of gear that I own. The Mammut Neon was reasonably priced~ and not too heavy (important for me b/c I'm pretty small -- I also considered the Mountain Hardware Splitter~ but it was too heavy).    90% of the time I've used it for cragging -- but I've hiked it up steep 10 mile approaches on alpine type climbs. The waistbelt is sort of crap (more on that later...) and it's not really made for super long approaches~ but it did just fine. I've also climbed some easy (5.8/9) multipitches with it -- again not great~ and not really what it's intended for~ but it works. My major problem with multipitching with this pack is that it's a bit too big for me~ so my head hits the pack when I look up. I'd say that it probably wouldn't be a big deal for the average size climber. 99% of the time that I'm climbing I'm one of the shortest people around (sucks getting beta from all you tall folk!!).    Last weekend my climbing partners all screwed me by leaving the crag early one by one and I got stuck packing out a 60m rope~ AND an 80m rope~ plus 20 draws and an entire trad rack (pretty much doubles of everything BD makes up to the #3 and a set of nuts~ assorted slings and random biners)~ an extra harness and 3 pairs of shoes. It sucked to carry that much and I had to use the rope catch to put the 2nd rope on top and clip the shoes to the outside~ but I made it out with all my gear. I'm not going to lie and pretend it was comfortable carrying that much gear~ but I was shocked that I got it all in.    My major complaints with this pack are that the sternum strap doesn't cinch down enough~ but I'm pretty small (5'4""~ 115#)~ so I'd say for 99% of the population that would not be an issue. As a female climber~ I'm used to getting screwed with men's gear (or fake unisex gear) that doesn't really fit women. At first glance the waist belt does look like a POS~ but I discovered when wearing a harness that the minimalist waistbelt was actually quite a bonus. It doesn't provide all that much support~ but does stabilize the pack enough so it's not swinging around~ and doesn't conflict with my harness.",Oct 2011,Jun 18 2012,0

Would I buy one again ....not a chance    I know a lot of people like this pack and the build is really nice I'm just not a fan of the closure   system  I think for the price it could have been made more secure for the few times you have to load it up .

8840,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,16, I bought the Neon 45 when it first came out...prior to knowing about the Miura 50.  At first I did not like the pack~ no real hip belt~ no compartments.  Fast forward 6 months and I love it.  I have ZERO problems using it for my trad outings.  Shoes~ double rack~ harness~ 2 water bottles~ food~ helmet~ guide book and a 70m rope on top.  I have not had any issues carrying around this with the wimpy hip belt it came with.  I've learned to really like this pack.  Once again I use this as my trad climbing pack and it works great.   I have had a full load in it and hiked 11 miles...no issues at all. ,Jun 2013,Mar 6 2014,0
8841,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,17, I am looking for an approach bag and am assuming by most accounts posted here that this would be perfect for me~ please correct me if i'm wrong.   1. I can only climb (Pacific Northwest) once per month or so~ with an approach rarely over 2 miles. Almost soley sport climbing and don't own any trad gear.   2. I'm not using it for multi-pitch climbing   3. Mostly need a bag to keep my days climbing gear stored and ready to go in garage and getting to the rock.   A couple of questions for those who own one.   1. Is there a better bag that I should consider of better value? More money but worth the cost is certainly ok.   2. Does the bag hold up to normal wear and tear?   3. How water resistant is the bag?   4. Can I store my rope in a Metolius rope bag inside the rope storage section of this bag?   Thanks for any additional info and replies.,Jul 2014,Aug 7 2014,0
8842,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,18, Mine was super convenient: it stands up on it's own~ and the top and back zippers and inner gear loops were cool.   Alas~ I would not recommend it for heavy loads. The waist belt doesn't really do anything~ the shoulder straps are super skimpy~ and the the worst: In less than 8 months of use~ it blew a frame stay out of the bottom of the pack~ which has proven really hard to fix~ and the aluminum frame stabs me when I wear it.   The rear zipper was also very annoying in use.   I was in love at first~ but it is under-suspended for it's size and mine didn't last.,Dec 2012,Aug 7 2014,0
8843,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,19, I'm currently using a Kelty Redwing 50. It is about $25 less than the neon~ 50 liters. It's a slightly unusual dimensions in that it is a wide pack which actually works out perfectly. And has proper support and waist belt. And has a 3 quarter front panel opening   I'm currently caring a 60meter 10mm rope rolled up in a trango cord trapper tarp~ this fits perfectly in the bottom of the pack like it was made for it~ sport rack~ shoes~ harness~ helmet~ rain and cold layers~ 1 litre water~ and ample space for snacks~ guide book and other smaller items. Carries like a dream even on a very steep 2 km approach.   Would definetly buy again over a mammut neon anyday.,Aug 2013,Aug 7 2014,0
8844,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,5,20," I climb mostly trad and was looking for a good crag pack for Gunks approaches less than one mile. I bought a Mammut Neon Gear 45 but I didn't like it so I returned it. I found it too small to fit my rack and other gear~ thought the back zipper was wimpy and got stuck to frequently~ and didn't like the thin waistbelt. The rope tarp seemed cool at first~ but I found it much too small to be practical~ and there is no way I could have fit both my rope and trad rack in that little pack.   Instead I bought the Osprey Porter 65 at REI. It's much bigger with enough room to fit a huge rack~ rope~ helmet~ shoes~ water~ etc. I also love the front panel zip which makes it easy to access everything inside. Previously I had the Osprey Atmos 65~ which is a great pack~ but it's a top loader which was a pain for cragging with trad gear - anytime I wanted to get something out of the bottom I had to dump everything out of the pack.   I suppose the Osprey Porter 65 isn't meant for schlepping loads to the crag~ but I think it works great for that. It's plenty comfy & has enough support to carry a 30+ lb load for a mile. I'm 6' tall but even so I think the load lifter straps still allow for a good distribution of weight to the hip-belt. The panel zip is the huge kicker for me - it makes it so easy to sort through a pile of trad gear. It's also got compression straps to keep the gear from lumping at the bottom.   For a pure crag bag~ I would like to see a few improvements on the Porter 65 - outside water bottle holders (currently I stick one liter of water in the small top zip and the rest in the main compartment)~ a large elastic pouch on the outside for carrying extra clothing layers (similar to the one on the Osprey Atmos)~ a slightly stiffer back panel~ and a slightly bigger waistbelt. Above all~ these are minor issues and the Porter 65 is my favorite crag bag that I've found.   I looked at the new Arcteryx Muira and it looked really nice~ just a little small for carrying everything I need. I think it's always nice to have extra room - my pack always seems to fill up quickly with ropes~ trad gear~ ice gear~ clothes~ guidebooks~ water~ headlamp~ slings~ sunblock~ lunch~ and everything else in the kitchen sink. And let's not forget the ""Theory of Gear Expansion~"" which states that the volume of gear when repacked at the end of the day is exponentially proportional to the amount of time you spent packing it at the beginning of the day.",Jul 2008,Aug 7 2014,0
8845,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,2,0, So I did actually end up buying a Neon 45~ though a couple years after this thread since I found one on sale for <$100 and figured why not.   I've had it for about a year now and so far it's worked out great for me. I only use it for sport climbing or trad when the gear carrying is shared~ as there's definitely no room for a full rack in there. Approaches are all less than a couple miles. Anything longer or with a notably heavy load and I'd probably whip out a different pack with more support~ but so far I haven't had to.   I didn't think I'd use the included rope tarp or chalk bag thing~ but I do actually use the rope tarp and have used the chalk bag thing~ too. They're not completely useless freebies!   The good: ,May 2010,Aug 7 2014,0
8846,Any experience with the Mammut Neon 45?,2,1, I have the Mammut Neon Gear. So far I really love it. Its a massive bag~ organizes well~ swallows gear and stands up to a beating. You should have no problem fitting you stuff. I do find it to not be very comfortable. I recently made an approach that totaled 800+ of vertical gain over about a mile. I had no issues with the bag comfort wise and I was loaded to the brim.    One of the things I don't like about the bag is the pocket systems. There is an external pocket on the outside top of the bag~ that I usually put wallet~ keys~ chapstick and a few bars in. On the inside of the bag~ there is a mesh pocket on the underside of the lid~ I find that if you stuff this pocket first~ then the top pocket becomes unusable because its so full. But thats really my only complaint. It defiently does not adjust well at all~ but its a seriously awesome crag bag~ keeps me organized~ and stands up well. Unless you plan on hiking in for over an hour~ I would highly recommend the bag.,Jan 2014,Aug 11 2014,0
8847,Crash Pad,1,0, I am looking for a second crash pad to add to my collection. What should I get. I am not at all concerned with price so I would just like to get the absolute best,Mar 2014,Jul 29 2014,0
8848,Crash Pad,1,1," Depends on your needs. ""The best"" is an ultimately subjective phrase. Do you need a massive pad~ for highballs and flat landings~ or pads better suited to talus-y landings? Weight is another subject to consider~ also frequency of use. (People say Organic has the best foam~ which I'm inclined to agree with~ but unless you'll climb enough to kill a pad's foam in a reasonable amount of time it doesn't matter so much IMO). Care to narrow down your parameters? IE standard landing type in your area~ highball Y/N~ can you hook a smaller pad onto your first pad(or vice versa) to carry 2 at once~ etc...",Sep 2012,Jul 29 2014,0
8849,Crash Pad,1,2,,Mar 2014,Jul 29 2014,0
8850,Crash Pad,1,3, My personal favorite pads you might want to look into:   Organic Big Pad Pros: great foam~ good closure~ big Cons:expensive   R3 Mad Rock Pros: very thick~ can pack gear inside~ tons of bells and whistles. Cons: Heavy~ expensive   Magnum Metolius Pros: big~ not too heavy Cons: Foam can wear out~ not perfect closure system.,Sep 2012,Jul 29 2014,0
8851,Crash Pad,1,4, The Organic Big Pad is the best highball pad out there. The foam is stiff enough to take big falls and holds up well. It drastically outlasts and outperforms its closest competitor~ the BD Mondo.   If you need something smaller (which is really just dependent on the boulder fields you climb at) the Organic Simple or Full is worth a look too. If you have big enough landing zones and boulder solo~ a Big and Full can be carried by a single person. It makes true highballs a little less nerve wracking when rolling solo.,Feb 2011,Jul 30 2014,0
8852,Crash Pad,1,5, I started with a mad rock pad and added the biggest size organic pad. I like the organic one a lot. The large landing zone is nice to have. And it seems well made.,Jan 2014,Jul 30 2014,0

8860,Trango Pulse Carabiners,1,7,,Feb 2014,May 2 2014,0
8861,Trango Pulse Carabiners,1,8, I've got a bunch of these - they're nice~ lightweight small 'biners.  The nose is pretty low profile so it doesn't get snagged. I like them. In that size range~ I think I like the Wild Country Astro a tiny bit better~ but they're pretty close.   The difference between the Bent Gate and the Straight gate Phases is minute. Can't feel a difference between the two when actually out climbing.  The Astro is 1 gram lighter than the Phase~ but I've put some hard use on my Astros over the past couple years and some of them are looking a bit beat up.  I haven't had my phases long enough to trash them~ but they seem like a beefier unit than the Astros.    Anyway~ the phases are nice~ small~ workhorse 'biners but nothing to get too excited about.,Apr 2006,Jul 7 2014,0
8862,Trango Pulse Carabiners,1,9, I was playing around with making my rack lighter and so I started looking at the biners in the market. I had no idea that a lot of the biners I have had are actually pretty heavy by toady's standards. I use Metolius Inferno for slings and Neutrinos for racking. Infernos are at 35g and Neutrinos are 36g.   I bought one of each of Trango Phase and Elelrid Nineteen G. I already had one of the Photons and had played with Petzl Ange~ Camp nano 23~ and Metolius FS in the store so I didn't have to buy them.   I already knew I wouldn't buy the Camp nanos or the metolius fs. Elelrid Nineteen G is available in a color pack and so is the the trango so I bought one biner of each to compare.   The Nineteen G has a stiff spring and it is so light that it spins too easily while clipping. Cleaning would be a pain on a 9.8 mm rope too because of the hooked nose~ tiny opening~ and stiff spring. So I ruled that out.   I personally don't like Trango gear so I was biased against it. But like Graham said~ the Phase have a recessed notch to make cleaning less of a problem. I also tried to clip using different orientations and it felt fine. At first I thought the grooves on the spine for your fingers to hold on to is a gimmick~ but they actually serve their purpose.   So it was down to the Trangos or the Camp Photons. While I know people love the photons for their size and weight~ they do cost a fair amount more AND personally I think I clipping fullsize biners is actually more awkward for me now - it just seems like I have to stretch my hand open so much more to clip.   So in the end I bought the trangos racking set for my cams. Still undecided as to what to get for the slings. Something lighter than Metolius Infernos and preferably cheap and with a snag-free nose. Still haven't found it yet.  biners! From Left: Camp Photon~ Wildcountry Helium~ Madrock something~ Black Diamond Neutrino~ Trango Phase~ Elelrid Nineteen G,Jun 2013,Jul 21 2014,1

8864,Mike's Belay Glasses - a quick impression,1,0, Borrowed these at the gym the other day. I haven't used them enough to write a full review and probably won't ever use them that much. But since they are the lowest priced prism design glasses~ ($39.95 + $8.95 shipping)I thought people might be interested in first impressions.    Unlike the CU or Belay Specs~ Mike's glasses use a plastic frame similar to reading glasses. This has advantages and disadvantages.    Mike's glasses seem a little heavier to me~ but the nosepiece is wider and more comfortable on my face~ which balances out any extra weight. They seem less flimsy~ but are likely more brittle. The side pieces won't bend~ but could break if mistreated. The sidepieces are attached via a typical sunglass hinge~ so the glasses fold up more compactly. The enclosed case is similar to those used for sunglasses~ rather than the flat box used by CU and Belay Specs. It is easier to fit in a pack or pocket.   The glasses sit on your face like normal glasses~ but because the side pieces are normal glasses length~ you cannot slide them down your nose to fit sunglasses underneath. Nor can you slide them down your nose to improve your peripheral vision~ they just fall off your face.     This latter point is a significant issue~ as the plastic frame construction means a lot more material around the prism itself~ which already limits one's peripheral vision. Once the climber is 10-15 feet off the ground~ no problem~ but until then~ I found it impossible to use Mike's glasses. Belay Specs and CU glasses have longer side pieces and less obstructing material~ so you can slip them forward on your nose~ look around them and still more or less see what's going on. But Mike's need to stay off. I couldn't get away with slipping them back on my head~ they fell off when I tipped my head back. If you add a keeper cord~ (highly recommended) you could leave them hanging on your neck at the start of the climb and this would work OK.   My bottom line- If money is no object~ I still prefer the original CU glasses ($120). For myself~ I bought the Belay Specs for $80 and have been very happy. But if you want belay glasses and don't have a lot of extra cash~ these seem like a good deal for the price. You give up some functionality~ specifically ease of use as the climber starts the pitch. But they will get the job done. belayglass.blogspot.com/,Nov 2007,Jul 24 2013,0
8865,Mike's Belay Glasses - a quick impression,1,1, None for me~ as I already wear glasses.  I can afford to strain my neck somewhat to actually look directly at my climber every now and then. It isn't that tough a day.  If hangdogging the project takes that long~ have the leader come down to earth and rest a bit~ then yank themselves back up to working position. I can only see the  special glasses getting smashed in the pack or sat on accidentally at the belay stance.,Nov 2007,Jul 24 2013,0

8875,What is the WORST gear review you've ever read?,1,2, There's no shortage of bad ones out there~ but I'd agree with you that the most worthless reviews are the ones where people get it and write a review based on how it looks without using it.

8878,What is the WORST gear review you've ever read?,1,5," I thoroughly enjoyed reading this guy's review on Pinkbike for the Rockymounts Pitchfork. The best part is how he posts Rockymount's response to back up his argument.    _____________________________________ Submitted by Stephen Brault a Cross Country Rider from Suffield~ Ct.   Date Reviewed: March 28~ 2012   Strengths:    Clean look   Weaknesses:    Doesn't fit Mini Coopers~ the hatch will hit it when you open it   Bottom Line:      Do not purchase this product if you own a Mini Cooper Please read my e-mail to rocky Mounts and there response~ they know it doesn't fit.    I recently purchased a Euro Pitch fork through Amazon as I had a few Amazon gift cards. This is my 3rd gift Rocky Mount bike rack I have purchased over the last 15 years. There seems to be a few design flaws because if I mounted the rack as instructed~ I cannot open my 2007 Mini Cooper hatch without hitting the rack~ with or without the end cap. I mounted it using the rear holes in the nose section and if the rack isn’t all the way over to the outside of my factory rack~ the hatch still hits the rack. It does not fit a Mini Cooper and you should not advertise it as so. My previous pitchfork I had to purchase the mountain bike attachment and I had to cut the end of the rack several inches so it would not hit the hatch when opened. There is a pattern here~ your design team is not doing their homework. That being said~ I will not purchase nor recommend your products to any of my teammates. I belong to a bike racing team (60 + members) and the largest tri team in the New England region ( 300+ members).    I’ll get off my soap box now.    Regards~    Steve  Stephen~    Thanks for the email. Sorry you do not like the product. Our Euros are actually our fastest growing product with positive feedback all over the country.    I do want to clear up a couple points though. Design Flaw? While the Mini does seem to be a car with a growing popularity it pales in comparison to other care sales. The reason we designed our racks with added length is to appeal to cyclists. 29ers and thru axels are becoming much more mainstream in the cycling community and the old 43"" trays were not long enough to accommodate the wheelbase of these changes. It would seem strange to make a rack that can not accommodate a large market share of bikes and instead appeal to a small market share of cars... right?    While we realize it hits the hatch on some years of the Mini (depending on the spoiler size and crossbar position)~ we also give you the option of mounting the rack on backwards. This would be the easy solution and solve your issue immediately. With that being said we also understand you might not like the ""look"". In which case you can cut off a small section of the tray (which you discovered). While inconvenient~ it works and will allow you to have the best looking~ best priced and most practical fork mount on the market on your Mini. We don't put that in the instructions because we don't want people cutting their trays without some idea of what they are doing.    Lastly we would ask that before bad mouthing our products and small company to look at the rack and remember you are driving a Mini. It is named the Mini because it is a small car. With small cars come unique situations. Throwing out the statement that ""we are not doing are homework"" is a broad statement for this situation. While we would like every customer we have to love our product we realize that we are going to have some outliers. As a small company trying to compete with the big boys we have to make decisions that appeal to the largest market share so we can keep the lights on.    You can now have your soap box back. Thanks for letting me use it.    Noah",Dec 2011,Jun 25 2014,0

When a few of Nike’s shoes didn’t fare so well in the 1981 reviews~ the company pulled its $1 million advertising contract with Runner’s World. Nike already had started its own magazine~ Running~ which would publish shoe reviews and commission star writers like Ken Kesey and Hunter S. Thompson.   “Nike would never advertise with me again~” Anderson says. “That hurt us bad.” In 1985~ Anderson sold Runner’s World to Rodale~ which~ he says~ promptly abolished his grading system. Today~ every shoe in Runner’s World is effectively “recommended” for one kind of runner or another. David Willey~ the magazine’s current editor~ says that it only tests shoes that “are worth our while.” After Nike closed its magazine~ it took its advertising back to Runner’s World. (Megan Saalfeld~ a Nike spokeswoman~ says she was unable to find someone to comment about this episode.)   “It’s a grading system where you can only get an A~” says Anderson~ who went on to become the founder and chief executive of Ujena Swimwear. nytimes.com/2011/11/06/maga…   ;)",Mar 2009,Jun 26 2014,0

(Maybe this is good so you knew for sure not to buy it… But otherwise…)   Probably not~ because the reading would suck just like the product.   About that coat that did not get reviewed…   New goods come out every season so I think that a year is a long enough time for a hard shell to last   if you are doing things like:   Alpine climbing / abrasion on rock.   Ski a season in it~ and rip through many trees at warp speed braking branches off in the process because you are a crazy person/skier.   Ice climb in the coat for a season~ and ""try"" to see if points want to put holes into the fabric purposefully.   Wear it in heavy downpours to see if water comes through~ as well as inspect how much is absorbed into the outer shell fabric layer.   Yes~ a cheaper coat that is as good is great.  Sometimes the price is worth a product.   Depends...   Would you not think that was enough to say ""This coat is da bomb!"" ?   No coat~ or fabric will last forever.

A metric ton of reviews~ either blogs or consumer reviews provide little info and are generally terrible.  They lack any sort of context~ be it the testers size and other items (to see if they even know what they're talking about size wise)~ or context to judge if they're capable of providing a quality review.   Usually~ you have to do some work and sift through bad reviews to find the good ones and THEN assimilate as much as you can to form a picture.   With climbing gear that may be difficult to do (small user base) or not all that important but other products can have extremely useful information out there.   Terrible reviews lack context.  As other have said ""The medium fit me well"" or ""I have wide feet and these were great""  provide us nothing.  In a climbing review I look for details and descriptions of use ""I placed the cams in lots of grainy~ granite cracks and found X""  They give a context and then observation which you can then match with your own to judge the quality of the review",Jun 2006,Jun 28 2014,0
8919,What is the WORST gear review you've ever read?,3,5, Hopefully the gear reviews I write are not the worst you've ever read. It's doubtful very many of you will have ever read them. I am the gear editor for a small climbing magazine with small readership in a very small country (New Zealand).  It's not my full-time job~ not even a part time job~ just a little something fun that I do on the side because I'm a climber and a bit of a gear-head. I get paid~ but it's peanuts~ and occasionally I'll get a couple pieces of free gear to review (and usually keep).  So I'm probably different than the gear editors of Rock and Ice or Climbing.    I try to use stuff for a couple of months at least before I review it~ but occasionally that time frame is shortened to meet deadlines.    I try to be as unbiased as I can - most of the gear reviewed is stuff that I've purchased on my own~ so I'm going to like most if it~ but occasionally I'll get something that I really hate - and I'll write that. I don't think my magazine has lost ad revenue~ or at least my editor hasn't told me about it. I would bet that some of my negative reviews have made gear companies less likely to send me free stuff~ but that's the cost I pay for being honest. I recently had a petzl tikka RXP sent to me to review - fuck I hated it. Short battery life~ long recharge time~ annoying features~ etc... That went in the review - I doubt Petzl will send me much more gear to review. Oh well.    I have to say~ as far as magazines go~ Gripped is by far the worst in terms of gear reviews.

I auto-lock belayed about 30~000' of rope (ouch) through my ATC Guide this year thus far and can vouch for its ease of handling in this mode as well as its better grip for rappelling and belaying lead falls -- so far the best on the market for this type of belay device.

8933,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,1,10, There's not a word here from anyone about the Trango B-52.  I switched to the B-52 about a year and a half ago after I got fed up with my Petzl Reverso.  The B-52 is super light and doesn't bind constantly like the Reverso~ which was my main gripe about it (I think it had a tendency to kink up my ropes~ too).  The B-52 has an auto-locking feature~ too~ without extra holes or welded keepers.  It's easy to set up in auto-locking mode and easy to feed rope when weighted which~ in spite of previous comments here~ I have found comes in very handy if my partner is hanging and needs to be lowered.  You just attach a sling to the binding locker and~ when you need to feed weighted rope~ pull the sling in the opposite direction of pull.   By the way~ I neither work for~ nor have I been influenced in any way by~ Trango.,Feb 2005,Oct 19 2006,0

8935,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,1,12, Ron~ I expected someone might come back with that one.  Since there was so much contrast/comparison with the Reverso only~ I thought it only fair to throw the the B-52 into the discussion~ particularly since it shares the same basic features as the Guide and the Reverso.   You make a good point with regard to wear on the climber's end of the device.  Mine is worn and I've wondered about it since~ as you point out~ that is a critical link in the chain in auto-block configuration.  If the owner of Trango says not to use a worn device in auto-block mode that's good enough for me.  I did check out the new B-52 on Trango's website today~ and it does look beefier all around.  I'll be picking one up soon.,Feb 2005,Oct 19 2006,0

8937,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,1,14," I have a B52 as well~ from the first year it came out~ and I've always wondered about the relatively thin aluminum on the anchor 'biner end which I see they've recently beefed up.    A couple of disadvantages over the ATC Guide: First~ there aren't any grooves or ""teeth"" to increase the friction for greater catching power and/or skinny rope rappeling. And secondly~ in order to use it with double ropes in autoblock mode~ you must add a second carabiner to the anchor end which really clutters things up.    There's a lot to be said for the B52~ primarily its light weight~ but the ATC Guide seems to be more versatile.",Dec 2001,Oct 28 2006,0

8939,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,1,16," Eli~ if your rope cut on a Reverso it was because it was rigged backwards. Shame on Petzl for making a device which can slice a rope if rigged wrong. Shame on your belayer for rigging it wrong.    David Champion~ I feel like an utter failure for not having influenced you in any way. Shame on my marketing efforts.   Ron~ thanks for bringing up the wear thing. Shame on us for making a device which can wear out. We've had a couple dozen returned to us to inspect for ""wear"" with surprising results: around 80% of the ""worn out"" one were~ in fact~ only slightly worn. The anodizing was worn off~ giving the appearance of being worn out but when measured with a micrometer~ we found them to retain more than 95% of their original thickness. Every one checked out to over 25kN. We did have one which was worn to approximately 50% of the original thickness and it still went to 25kN. The structure of the B-52 is incredibly strong for two reasons. First~ it's manufacturered from 7075 T6 aluminum with a tensile strength of over 70~000 psi. Second~ the structure is very strong~ being supported equally on both sides of the load points with very little leverage. FUN FACT: We beefed it up on the fat end~ not to increase the strength~ but to increas the size of the area to which  the cable is glued. We were having too many rejects in the manufacturing process.   John~ shame on me and you for not setting you up with a B-52 to review. It's my favorite device and I think you'd like it. Call me if you want to review one.   Another FUN FACT: The B-52 was not designed with autoblocking in mind. It just turned out that you could do it with the B-52. Unless you're a guide I think it's a highly overrated technique. Eli~ good on you for never having to lower a client. It speaks highy of your ability to choose routes matched to your client's ability. Unfortunately I''ve had to lower quite a few people in my day and have been really glad that it is easy and simple. I always used a Munter when bringing up seconds when guiding. When I've had to be lowered from an autoblock it's never taken less that 10 minutes to get me going~ even when executed by allegedly skilled autoblockers in perfect setups. I no longer let anyone belay me with an autoblock.   Kurt Johnson~ while the teeth of an ATC Guide (and Jaws) add significantly to the friction available to stop a fall~ the B-52 does a cool thing: when it loads up it rocks over and~ in addition to the normal ""kink-in-the-rope"" friction~ it pinches the rope between the locking carabiner and the face plate~ resulting in more friction that you would suspect. When we test them for relative friction~ the B-52 falls almost exactly halfway between Jaws and our Pyramid. Haven't tested it against an ATC Guide yet but I suspect that it would fall closer to the 'Guide than the Pyramid. Because of the pinching action~ one of the really cool things you can do with a B-52 is modulate the friction when lowering someone by using your thumb and index finger (of your non-braking hand) to rotate the device forward. In many cases you can easily bring a lowering climber to a stop with this techinque. Shame on us for causing clutter in your anchor setup.   FUN FACT: One of the early B-52 prototypes actually had a ring to hang it off of for autoblocking~ exactly like the ATC Guide. You can see a picture of it here: ",Jan 2001,Feb 5 2007,0

8941,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,1,18," I think this issue goes more toward pre-planning the anchor & rigging positions than type of device. I've been able to get the Reverso going on a lower with that kind of weight in under a minute. To do this~ I've always kept the rigging higher than me and the anchor pro higher than the rigging anticipating how gravity will take the weight.    Having the gear needed & accessible for a pulley is great advice.   I don't think Eli had rigged improperly; he was told the same thing I was~ the wear on the Reverso is inconsequential. But~ I think the personal decision in using a friction device in the condition it gets in after repeated use~ is accountable to the user~ regardless of the bad advice -- equipment should be in good order when used for fall protection. But~ I think a note to all would be to check any belay device for edges that may damage the rope & replace the device when excessive wear occurs. I'm still using a Reverso & Reversino at this time.   One thing I have done with an overhanging traversing problem~ I went with a direct munter instead of a locking configuration so I could take/feed rapidly & more fluidly -- you could essentially use a device non-locking~ but the braking direction of the munter allows a more workable situation~ (in my opinion~ of course). A quick mule & overhand achieves the mainline tie-off.   What I would like to know~ how do devices compare in absorbing force by use of friction inherent in a design given a huge leader fall? I much prefer to use the Reversino to belay a leader when using the smaller rope strand sizes. I'm also pro glove-use~ it's a smart idea.   The one trouble spot I've had is using larger diameter ropes when belaying a leader~ any rope that gets larger than a 10.5 is a bitch. I've gotten real good at feeding out~ but older ropes that get ""puffy""; I have to use a munter.   Any thoughts on any of this? I think it makes for good discussion.",Dec 2005,Feb 6 2007,0

8943,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,1,20, I'm a longtime B-52 user; in general I like it but I have some misgivings.   I wish it provided more braking force. I suspect most off these contraptions are designed with lighter climbers in mind (I'm 190 lbs ... not exactly a gorilla). With ropes smaller than 10mm I find myself relying on my autoblock backup to give enough friction for~ which is not what it's for.   The only device I have that grabs hard enough is my Trango Jaws~ which actually overachieves on most single ropes. But it's the one I hand to my wee girlfriend when she has to belay me.   I'm curious to hear from those who have tried both the guide and the b52 how they compare in friction. My partner uses the guide~ and I found my b-52 almost dangerously slick on his shiny new 8.2mm half ropes. He found the guide to be too slick also~ but he seemed to handle it a bit bettter than I did.   Trango's literature suggests the b52 should actually produce MORE friction on the skinny ropes than it does on my 9.9~ but it sure doesn't seem to be the case.   I'll switch to the guide if it's substantially grippier ... but I'll miss the b52's sleek lines and low weight.   FWIW~ I don't think autoblocking is overrated~ especially when using double ropes or bringing up 2 seconds.    And I am a bit alarmed how fast my (1st generation) b52 is wearing on the rope side. It's not just the anodizing ... grooves started forming in the aluminum after about 10 raps. I'm glad it's still strong after 50% wear~ because it will start to look scary soon.,May 2007,May 24 2007,0
8944,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,0," Paul~   The ATC-Guide produces substantially more friction than the B-52~ especially in ""High Friction Mode""~ with the jaws on the belay side:  ATC-Guide - High Friction Mode   I sometimes use a second carabiner with the B-52 to increase friction for rappelling with skinny ropes.   My first-generation B-52 also developed deep grooves; I have since replaced it with a second-generation B-52.  The new model has a lot more metal in that area.   Also~ auto-blocking is easier with the ATC-Guide than with the B-52~ especially releasing the auto-block under load.",Jan 2001,May 24 2007,0
8945,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,1, I have owned the atc~ reverso~ gi gi~ and now an atc guide.  For belying on 10 mm ropes the atc feeds the best.  I bought a reverso because i was belaying lots of followers and i thought it would take less energy with a reverso.  Little did i know~ it takes tons of energy to pull the rope through in guide mode.  Often i was more pumped from belaying than climbing.  The only way i found around this (besides using 8.5mm ropes) is to hang my rack or sneakers off of the biner that the rope runs through.  This pulls the biner away from the belay device allowing the rope to run though with minimal energy.  Maybe a coil spring (like on the old stich plates) would solve the problem~ but more likely create others.       Anyway~ my new  atc guide really sucks for belaying a leader.  Too often the rope pulls the device into the biner and locks up the rope.  I can pull the rope through the device~ but with lots of effort.  if the climber needed a quick feed for a despate clip I'd feel more comfortable with an 11.5 mm rope in a gri gri. About 20 -30 times per belay i pull the device away from the biner so the rope will feed smoothly.  The plus is that i am positive i can hold big falls with the atc guide.  It definitly locks the rope off. This  problem is also the same in auto-lock mode.  I have been somewhat successful hanging gear from the belay biner to pull it away from the device. This might affect the hands free lock-off feature.  Maybe the rack or item hanging off the biner could  snag on an edge and prevent the biner from pinching against the device.        Basically none are perfect.  The atc feeds wonderfully~ but wears quickly and gets a sharp edge.  I've gone through 5.  The gi gi is the best feeding auto lock i've used~ though still not great~ and it is more junk to carry.  The reverso feeds well for belaying the leader~ but  is hard to lock off and difficult to pull rope through in guide mode.  The atc guide looks like it will last forever~ or at least till something better comes out.  I think i may go back to the atc and gi gi combination.      Maybe a petzel pear biner would help the rope lock-up problem?  I'm using a large trapazoidal shaped petzel.      Is anyone else finding it difficult to feed rope through the atc guide?  any ideas?,Apr 2007,Jun 3 2007,0

8947,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,3, Gang~   When using a device in guide mode it really helps to use a smooth round stock carabiner. There are only 2 that I know of the Petzl Attache and the Trango Mini HMS. The forged shapes in most 'biners will make it tough to pull rope through.    JL~ are you advocating doubling up on the blocking carabiners to make it run smoother? Dude~ you're playing with fire there~ not to mention that you're playing with your second's life..

8949,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,5," Linda~   I'm not sure what you mean. A Reverso and a Stitch plate are waaaaay different. Are referring to how a Stitch plate can be made to feed smoother by adding a second 'biner into the rope loop?"" This is a common trick with many tube style devices and it works well with all of the symmetrical devices I've tried. Don't know how it works with the Reverso~ though. Further to my post~ the mechanics of what is going in in the regular belay/rappel configuration vs. what's going in with an autoblock are not even remotely the same. Just because doubling up carabiners with a regular belay device makes it feed smoother while still affording a solid lock off does not imply that it will do either with an autoblock. It may work and it may not. I haven't tested it.   Mal",Jan 2001,Jun 3 2007,0

8952,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,8, Hey Mal-   My partner's reverso was rigged up correctly in the incident I described above. His pulling down on the brake strand to arrest my fall rotated the device enough that the sharp edge on the load strand side of the device was in more direct contact with the rope and easily sharp enough to cut it.  I 've heard folks sometimes file down that razor sharp edge after it forms~ but I don't particularly like climbing with a knife on my harness or a knife attached to my climbing rope!,Aug 2001,Jun 4 2007,0
8953,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,9, Wild story Eli. I'm going to have to fiddle around a bit with one to see how that could happen. I have seen several cut ropes from people's mis-threaded Reversos but that's just a matter of not paying attention.   Further to your post way up-thread that you haven't had to lower anyone from an autobloc~ you better polish up those techniques if you go climbing with me.

8957,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,13, Mal - I say the autoblocking is just easier working with either 1 or 2 seconds & doesn't twist the rope.    I dig the munter~ too - but if one second hangs~ it's hard to keep managing the other climber. I guess I could set up friction hitches to back up the brake hand~ but I've not yet done it; or just tie in both to the same strand using a butterfly at a shortened interval.   I dunno~ I'd like to keep the autoblock as an option~ I think it's cleaner when keeping the climbers on independent strands. I've practiced & practiced & practiced using the reverso with a second fully on it; I've got the pulley down so slick~ it's hard to beat me on the buddy evac systems; course~ this one is easy. The hard one is picking off my f'n leader that's a dead elephant.,Dec 2005,Jun 5 2007,0

8959,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,2,15, I finally borrowed my partner's atc guide~ and what can i say ... we got down from the crag and i ran to the climbing store and got one. This is the first belay/rap doodad i've ever used that i really like (in my closet you'll find a sticht plate~ figure 8~ bachli seilbremse~ original atc~ trango jaws~ b-52~ and god knows what else). This is the only thing that's provided plenty of friction on skinny ropes without sacrificing smoothness or ability to work with normal ropes (haven't tried fat ones).   I WANTED to love my B-52. I still love its light weight~ sleek lines~ and elegant simplicity. In contrast~ the Guide looks like something forged in a fire pit by a caveman. Its weight suggests stone age origins too ... 50% more than the B-52.    But the first time down on a pair of skinny half ropes~ using my autoblock for backup (rather than added friction~ to help me hang on for dear life) was a revelation. I'm on the big side for climbers (190) but that should be within the working range of any device~ I'd think. The B-52's claims of providing increased friction on skinny ropes seem utterly fictional. My partner (180 lbs) wanted to kill me after he rapped on it with the skinny doubles.    For what it's worth~ I like the reverso even less. It autoblocks fine~ but provides so little friction on medium to skinny ropes that I won't even use it.   I find the Guide easier to use in autoblock mode than others I've tried. Not sure yet how big an improvement the little ring is for releasing. I'll have to hang someone from the ceiling and play with it. I do appreciate being able to use just one biner to hang it with double ropes. On paper that seemed like a minor deal with the B52~ but in practice I found it annoying. It added time at most belays~ since I usually climb with a pretty minimalist setup. Having to poach biners from the rack to find two same-sized ones is one extra thing I don't want to think about.   AND ... in defense of autoblocks in general: I think they're overrated for use by guides~ but are brilliant for use with experienced partners. I'd rather use a munter hitch (or 2) if i thought there was much chance of having to lower someone. The autoblock comes into its own when you're tring to move fast on multipitch climbs. If you both have one~ you can fly. It's also the only way to go if you have a party of 3.   I wish there was a way to fuse the performance of the Guide with with the minimalism and light weight of the B52. But until that happens~ I'll eat my wheaties and hoist this thing up with me.,May 2007,Jun 12 2007,0

[End - partial quote from Zack.]   I also had similar problems with my ATC Guide - on a new but broken in 10.2mm rope this Summer.  I felt that belaying my good buddy with the inability to make quick feeds to be real bad Karma and not so good for his head either.     I did not experience this with my ATC-XP on the same rope.  It was because I liked the ATC-XP so much that I picked up the ATC Guide for either myself or my wife - depending on the situation.   Well~ I went back to the ATC-XP which works very smoothly with this 10.2mm rope.   Perhaps it's the added mass of the Guide version which causes it to drop down and bind up?  I haven't held the two versions side by side~ nor have I pulled out my calipers to measure the spacing and other critical dimensions on the two variants of this device.   Flash forward to my recent purchase of a pair of 8.1mm PMI Verglas ropes.  These ropes are ""wicked slick"" for the first couple hundred feet of climbing and scared the living daylights out both of us.  After these first couple hundred feet of climbing~ they lost their ""sheen""~ and I think we're going to love them.   For my first rappel on these ropes last Saturday~ I decided to use my ATC-XP in friction mode and it was more than enough to the point of making me nervous - with a stick/slip action.  We were rapping off of bolts~ but it was not the kind of smoothness that I like to impart on any protection that my life depends on.  I'll play with rapping off of the low friction side of the ATC-XP next.   I decided to pick up a Reversino this week~ but have yet try it.  I'll report back.   I have a couple of questions about the ""V"" slots on both the XP and the Guide versions of the ATC.  From my sticky rappel experience with the ATC-XP and the 8.1mm Verglas doubles~ it would appear that any insecurity about them holding a leader fall with these ropes is imaginary - that the dynamic of the rope getting ""sucked"" down into the grooves is fine with the average 8.1mm rope.     I realize that BD reports you can use the ATC-XP and Guide with as thin as a 7.7mm pair~ but then again~ people used to consider a hip  belay to be adequate too.   I also have a question about the Reverso/Reversiono.     Petzel recommends that you always use them with a directional anchor - whether: ",Jun 2007,Sep 18 2007,0

8971,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,7, sorry to bring up such an old thread~ but i've only recently got out of the dark ages and had some other questions i thought someone might be able to help me with:   #1   was ascending up a multi a couple of months ago~ and an earlier party was coming down on us.  they got their ropes stuck~ and one of them used their guide as an ascender to get up (using both ropes together as a fixed line).  so i've done my share of jugging with prussics~ a few different types of full sized ascenders~ rope men~ and whatever it is called when you prussic around a big beaner~ but was wondering if someone had a visual of how to rig the guide as an ascender.   #2   also~ thought someone might be able to help solve a debate we were having earlier that day:  is it safe to belay two different people up two different ropes (top rope) simultainiously using a standard ATC? (obviously keeping hands on the brake?)...while i'm at it~ what about if we were trying to move~ and the first up took off to lead the next pitch~ while the latter was still coming up.  probably would be a big rope mess~ but what about that?   thanks in advance - S,Sep 2006,Apr 23 2008,0
8972,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,8, Steve~ #1 is a rig with the autoblock off the belay loop. Piton Pete gives an illustration but using the gri-gri. Using the guide/reverso/similar device is basically the same~ but the gri-gri is far more manageable & you would need to manage a knot so you can treat a two strand standard rap as a one strand fixed to allow pull when you get to a safe anchor in a lower position.    #2 - I've actually done 2 with only munters (why? because I left my device at the anchor below). This takes practice~ you can't ever take your hands off of both strands; this is something you really need to be solid with when it comes to belay technique -- it's slip~ slap~ slide times two and very fast. If a second falls~ you really have no choice but to lock off strands -- a redirect would be helpful & recommended~ if you can; even better are direct-anchor munters on separate biners.    Buddy rescue at this stage is risky to consider belay escape. So going with a basic ATC to belay two seconding climbers can turn into more than epic in a split second if your skills are not dialed in. But is it possible? Sure~ you just don't have the auto-blocking rig. If the terrain is well within ability to simul-climb~ using this technique works when climbing as a party of three.    Sending the leader up & belaying a seconding climber -- again~ if you all could simul-climb anyway; it is possible -- but the trouble is if the seconding climber hangs~ you could pull your leader off or short-rope them as you lock-off. So the risk is higher in this situation.    I would say~ if the weather is moving in and you 3 had to get out of terrain~ this rigging is possible to consider to try and get someone up to a safer anchor/terrain situation; but I wouldn't consider it as much an option if a fall due were likely due to terrain difficulty. You could also just have the leader short fix & keep the belay on the seconding climber independent until they reach to your anchor position.   If you didn't need to move a leader up as quickly as possible/simul-climbing wasn't likely either; what you could do instead is butterfly mid-line and use one rope and belay both seconding climbers. Use your second strand as a free tag-line if you needed to get down to them.,Dec 2005,Apr 23 2008,0
8973,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,9, I posted a response to this thread about how my new atc guide was very difficult to feed the rope through.  I was especially bummed when belaying a leader.  Well~ now that the device is quite worn~ it feeds much better.  Maybe the holes are bigger or the coating has worn off.  Anyway~ now I really enjoy the device.  When its time to get a new one I will break it out when i need to do exstensive rapelling....el cap?.,Apr 2007,Aug 2 2008,0
8974,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,10, i love my guide and it's fantastic for bringing up seconds and the multi friction modes. one complaint~ sort of~ i was taught that if you ratchet the biner clipped through the rope that it will lower your second inch by inch in case they need only a little slack to get back to a rest. I did notice after about three weeks worth of climbing (8 days total) the biner had worn a sharp edge on the inside bottom edge of the device. something to keep your eye out for. from now on i'll just use some acc cord through the hole for short lowers,Apr 2008,Aug 20 2008,0
8975,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,11, is it possible to use the auto-locking function outside of guide mode? I plan on getting one soon because i typically climb with people heavier than me and i have used a both a gri gri and a cinch and both help a lot with falls when the climber weighs 1.75x as much as the belayer. the problem is~ i don't do much multi pitch climbing so i would rarely use the guide mode. i would consider getting either a gri gri/ cinch but i don't feel that i can give a safe lead belay with them... i know it is possible i just don't feel like my partner is safe when i try to do so,May 2014,Jul 3 2014,0
8976,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,12, Eli asked: is it possible to use the auto-locking function outside of guide mode?   As far as I know no. If you can its totally new to me. The high friction mode is as close as you'll get for braking assistance when belaying a leader from the ATC outside of guide/auto-locking mode.    If youre able to throw together an anchor with an upward directional (or whatever way the anticipated fall is likely to come from) and connect to it to help out.,Dec 2012,Jul 3 2014,0
8977,Gear Review - Black Diamond ATC Guide,3,13, Eli~ consider an assisted-braking device. The Mammut Smart & Alpine Smart~ and Edelrid MegaJul are three such devices. They behave a lot like the ATC~ but amplify your braking force. The main difference is how you lower/pay slack~ which takes a little getting used to~ but may be worthwhile for you! They are a nice compromise between the more intuitive ATC and the locking GriGri.   I would advise against trying to use the ATC Guide in guide mode when you are *below* your climber. From what I can tell~ the system depends on gravity to keep everything in order~ and it is nigh-impossible to pay out slack.,Jul 2013,Jul 3 2014,0

8998,Beal Rope Brush - A Review in Pictures,1,10, I'm considering getting one of these~ too.  Kinda tired of running to the laundromat for the front-loading washer and all the waiting that goes with it.  When I managed a challenge course (ropes course)~ we used something similar~ but it hooked to the hose~ which I'm considering getting instead.   With either manual device~ is there any concern that the tightness of the brushes might actually push dirt further in? With a washing machine or bathtub~ the agitation may float out the dirt from the rope.  With a manual brushing device~ it seems like it could push it in further...which would also explain why the water looks cleaner as you go.  The dirt would be going INTO the rope instead of out!   I don't know~ it's just something occurred to me as a possibility.,Jun 2014,Jun 23 2014,0
8999,Beal Rope Brush - A Review in Pictures,1,11, Cool review~ Tim.  TFPU!   Just curious~ is there any evidence that periodically cleaning a rope actually prolongs its life?

9006,Black Diamond The MAGNATRON  Auto locking carabiner,1,0," Bought this when it came out the middle of the 2013 winter. This auto locking carabineer is one with a twist. The twist is that it doesn't have a twist~ lock that is. No sir this puppy locks up tight with the power of magnets.    In this day and age you would t think that there is no new way to reinvent the locking carabineer. Well black diamond did just that. For those who live on another planet the last year and a half BD has been leaking this magnetic based closing system for a auto locking carabineer. The traditional method has been a spring system that locks the biner closed as a default setting. This has been working pretty well over the years. There have been a couple variations but essentially all the same theme.    So~ are these any better or are they just a gimmick. Having first getting one of these units in the middle of winter gave me a chance to see how it performs under winter conditions. It just so happened it showed up in the middle of my ice climbing season. I made a point of taking it out every day that I went climbing. This added up to about forty or fifty days of ice climbing.   Let's start out by saying these things do close as they are suppose to. In the 100 days of use to this point sometimes using this carabineer several times on a single climb I have never found it to be open when it was suppose to be closed. The magnet has two gates that act independently. What would possibly keep one gate on one side open would probably not effect the other side. Dust~ running water~ mud~ ice nothing has stopped this puppy from closing when it was suppose to be closed. So in the closing department this thing gets a A+.    The only real issue I have found is with winter climbing. Larger gloves are not well suited to pinching the triggers that open the biner. Where the fairly small pind/buttons which are embedded into groves. You have to pinch these groves to hit the gates. Winter gloves just do not fit within a the grooves. Not saying they won't fit it just takes a bit more effort to line up the tips of your gloves to the embedded gate clips. Most of the time this is not really a issue~ most of the time. There are times however when your tired cold and the minor discomfort of double clicking that gate is a pain in the ass. Fortunately this doesn't happen often. Under summer conditions with thin summer gloves this is pretty much a non-issue. With bare hands this biner is a no brainier. Quick to lock~ quick to open and on top of that reliable. I have seen two basic models one being the pear shaped munter biner and the relatively new belay biner.    I have to admit that after 8 months of use I am still trying to catch the thing open by mistake just so I could go ""Ah you sneaky bastard! I knew I couldn't trust you"" but I haven't been able to say that yet. Standard locking biners I am always catching myself not locking or waiting to lock at a more suitable moment. Why right now is not suitable don't ask because I don't know.    So in conclusion I like the Magnetron. I make a point of annoying my climbing partners/clients by saying ""Lets use the MAGNETRON!""  I have only used the pear shaped munter style but see no reason why the belay would not work just fine. In fact on the belay is most certainly the place you want your belay puppy locked and loaded. Think I will add the belay to the hundreds of biners I have.   A for the overall design and ingenuity. If they made the indentations a bit bigger so that winter ice gloves worked better I could add the plus value. Don't hesitate to get one if thinking it was a gimmick has been holding you back.

A few people question the autolocking time savings~ but I've been in alpine or multipitch where time is important and I've actually made the choice not to lock my lockers in some situations (if you think about it there is at least 3 lockers to be locked and unlocked to setup an anchor and belay the follower). If you need to do 20+ pitches and are already tired this adds up.,May 2012,Dec 5 2013,0

9029,Black Diamond The MAGNATRON  Auto locking carabiner,2,2, I have used the magnetron in many applications and must say with all its innovation it does have its downfalls. The first application I used it in was as a one handed rescue biner in swiftwater rescue and the second when winter climbing in wet conditions. The magnetron worked beautifully initially being easy to operate one handed and having a reliable auto lock. The issues come when sand~ grit~ ice etc are introduced into the equation. Sand and ice got under the pinching side of the biner causing the biner to lock itself shut. Obviously better it locking itself shut than open~ but it is still a massive annoyance when climbing and a safety issue in rescue applications.,Nov 2012,Apr 10 2014,0
9030,Black Diamond The MAGNATRON  Auto locking carabiner,2,3, I'll actually chime in here.. I bought one a year or so back out of curiosity.   My observations: I rather like it for use while sport climbing. It's autolocking action is more convenient than the regular twist-lock carabiners. Works really nice and quick in combination with my gri gri.   I will never bother taking it with me into a non-sport-climbing situation. I.e. multi pitching.. It's big~ and heavy~ I usually use locking dmm phantoms and similar. In additon the autolocking is way to cumbersome for use in an anchor setup. Making a clove hitch with one hand seems impossible on the magnetron~ but easy on a regular locker.    As for use on my belay device - still prefer a regular locking one that can be open AND locked. At times it's fiddly threading a belay device when you've just pulled up the ropes and there is some tension on it.    I have one and will use it~ but a regular locking carabiner is just as good and more versatile.,Sep 2010,Apr 11 2014,0

9037,Black Diamond Dawn Patrol jacket,1,4, Update on this jacket: Well a winter has passed and I have had a lot of time to take this jacket out. I was climbing Blue Angel down in southern Alberta with the head of Arcteryx Advanced R/D and had a chance to pick his brain about this garment and it's design.            The one thing that I didn't notice before but certainly do now is just how light this jacket really is. It packs up so light that it really is that go to item when ever I am walking out the door. Warm days ice climbing I will throw a puffy belay Jacket over top of it. On cold days it is a great insulating layer that fits over my warm puffball layers. Because of the stretch in the material it fits comfortably over the outer layers. Often it is just that little extra armour that is required.              Durability wise it seems to be holding up pretty well. I must have 60 to 70 days on this layer by now and it still looks pretty good. I am not easy on gear I might add.           It is not a bomb proof all weather mountain shell rather a active wear garment that fits into the hiker~ biker~ mountain runner and crag climber. Would I recommend this. Yes if you can afford two shells. If all weather is your priority this is not your garment. I am much more impressed with this layer now that I know  how to better pair it up with layers. I use it skiing~ ice climbing~ ski touring. Breathable~ light weight and durable. CORRECTION:I stated that Gore was involved with the material in the original review. However it is a Shoeller material which makes sense given Gores I hate water attitude.,Sep 2009,Jun 6 2014,0

9054,Good crash pads?,1,15, I highly recommend spending the extra money for a better pad. If you boulder a lot~ and especially if you boulder a lot by yourself~ you will not regret it. Almost everyone I know who went the el cheapo route and bought a Mad Pad wishes they had spent the extra 50 or so bucks for a quality pad. I can't imagine the ClimbAxe pad is much better. if you already have a good pad~ and are looking to pick up a second pad~ then getting a cheaper one isn't a bad idea. But if this pad is going to be the thing that keeps your ankles from rolling and your feet from bottoming out on hard rocks~ buy a good pad.,Dec 2007,Sep 8 2010,0

Edelrid solved this problem by splitting one of the 4 layers of foam down the middle to allow for flex when folding... now i know what your thinking "" if there's a split in the foam wont there be a gap when its unfolded ...the answer is no the foam all lines up flush when unfolded....as for mad rock pads theres are the only pad that i will 100% advise u not to buy... you'll regret it the first time u take a hard fall and realize that pad is as stiff as the ground .....and then theres no happy medium either because once the foam breaks in its way too soft youll have better luck landing on shag carpet from the 1970's ( or your grandmas basement).... moral of this story Whats worse shelling out a couple extra bucks for something that will last ...or being cheap and shelling out all sorts of money on medical bills when u break ur ankles ...not to mention the fact youll be out from climbing for at least 6 weeks.... oh and BTW my Edelrid DEad Point was bought and shipped to my door for $189.16 USD from start to finish of the ordering process i want to say the pad was at my door in like 15 days or something like that",Nov 2010,Nov 21 2010,0

9066,Good crash pads?,2,6," I was looking for a crash pad recently and based on reports on here and supertopo review~ I was going to get the organic.  Problem was I  wanted to get one for bouldering the same day.   The rei and sport chalet in Phoenix only had Metolious pads.  I got the Recon.  I've used it a couple times so don't know about durability~ but Meolious usually makes bomber shit. It has  performed well after a few uses.  Foam was soft enough for a short fall onto your back and didn't bottom out after a fall onto my feet from 12 feet.  The thing seems pretty bomber and has Velcro to prevent pad from bending if you fall on the angled cut crease where it folds.  It's 42x60x4"" and with a trifold it packs pretty small to 20"" wide.  It carries well.  Only down side is it has very little room in pocket to carry shit.  It cost me $260.  No place online had any on sale so I'll get my 10% rebate from REI next year.  Overall happy with purchase.   The pad barely fits in the back of my SUV with back seat up. Any bigger and I'd have to strap it on outside of vehicle if I had passengers in the back.   If I get another I'm gonna get an organic online",Oct 2010,Apr 26 2014,0

I haven't got experience with other pads so I can't comment.   As a side note~ his R3 is also a lot better at holding stuff inside of it. I can get my shoes and a few small items~ and that's it.

9079,Edelrid Booty! ,1,0, I sent my AMGA rock-guide exam. Phew. Done. Well~ not completely done~ but at last certified in rock. Did my ski in February and hopefully hiking the Alpine in the fall…and then time to get into some post-graudate guiding!   My rock exam was in the desert outside Vegas. Before heading out there~ to Red Rock National Conservation Area~ I dropped by the SCARPA/Edelrid offices to chat about a writing project. Well~ the generous folks over there (thanks Mark~ Moritz~ Sam~ and Kim!) decided it was unthinkable to embark on a big objective without some new gear…and who was I to argue? Some monkeying around and wham–a box full of new gear to test.   I’ve never owned a single Edelrid product~ which is strange because the German company invented the modern kernmantle rope in 1953. They’ve also introduced dozens of other technical advances~ including the stitched quickdraw~ dymamic ropes~ and one of the first modern sit harnesses. SCARPA recently began distributing Edelrid products in North America~ so I’ve had more occasion to check out their stuff. It’s all high end~ as 60 percent of their gear is still made in Germany and they have a long history in the alpine. Here are a couple highlights from my rock exam:   The HMS Strike Slider (63g; $19.95) is a pear-shaped locker that uses an integrated~ extremely low-profile locking mechanism. One slides a tiny~ three-ribbed tab downward on the gate to disengage the locking mechanism. It’s spookily sleek~ I gotta say. I showed it to several examiners and candidates on my exam and folks seem split 50/50–some didn’t think it as secure as a screw-gate while others shrugged and said~ “Seems good to me.” Slide down on this low-profile tab and the keynose opens. Sleek~ sexy~ and presumably secure   I used it in a variety of applications~ from my main belay ‘biner to my third hand to attaching a quadolette to an anchor–bomber~ no sweat. It’s particularly easy to work with~ as it rotates either direction easily~ even through a weighted sling. I spent a good ten minutes trying to get the thing to open “accidentally” in various orientations~ without success. I’m still not going to say it’s my go-to belay ‘biner~ but for anchors~ back-ups~ and critical clips~ the Strike is a fantastic option. Lightweight (63g compared to 80-plus grams for some of my heftier lockers) and it handles smoothly–have a couple on your rack and see where they fit in.

9108,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,2,5," I'm glad someone is reviewing and testing the gear4rocks stuff.  Thank's for doing it.   Personally~ I wouldn't use them.  Of course~ I've already got a full rack~ so the pain of $60/piece cams has faded.   That said~ I just don't think that the company is reputable~ yet.    The quality looks on par with CCH aliens~ which is an endorsement and derogation at the same time.   Also~ I think that the name ""Links"" cam is very telling about the company as a whole considering that it is a rip off of another brand(they should've picked a more reputable name to rip off).     The intent was to create a cheap option.  There was no intent to to offer innovations.  There is no real connection that I can see to climbing within the company.     It seems like some machine shop realized they could pump out knock offs of climbing gear~ sell them over seas~ and be done.  Has anybody thought about how hard it would be to follow through with the company on any injuries considering that they are overseas and only visble as a seller on ebay?   Not for me.   Evan",Aug 2007,Mar 31 2011,0
9109,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,2,6, Although I agree that they are not a reputable dealer at this time~ I think they are making the steps towards that by having climbers within the community do reviews and by seeking the proper certifications.   I agree with Evan that they are not wholly reputable or trusted~ but that's all the more reason for someone to test them in a controlled setting. (Sew up a crack~ take a fall on one well above the ground with a backup MasterCam~ C4~ or other UIAA certified cam close behind.)

If you have ever touched any cheapo cam and then used a quality cam~ you can tell the difference.  If you have ever tried to place a cheapo or off brand cam~ you know it's a pain in the ass.

9118,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,2,15, Thanks for taking the time to write this review. But personally I don't derive any meaningful information from it.    A review with integrity is one where the reviewer has not received anything of value from the manufacturer~ and the gear has been used and abused in the field for at least a season by an experienced and knowledgeable individual. Climbing is a serious enough game that if these two basic conditions aren't met~ the review should be considered tainted.    The example of your emphasis on CE certification is a case in point: before Conor Byrne's explanation~ neither you nor I nor many reading this thread understood that CE certification is worth balls. If a reviewer is not knowledgeable~ she/he has the potential to mislead the community. Worse still~ mislead in the interest of the manufacturer~ which has a shillish taste to it. Had Conor not corrected~ you and I and others would be in the dark.     While I appreciate your intention to contribute to the community~ I agree with others who are skeptical of the merits of this review. Hope I'm not violating Guideline #1.,Nov 2003,Mar 31 2011,1

9126,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,3,3," While I agree with Base's ""buy US made""~ I have to say~ there is definately a niche for a low cost~ bomber~ simple~ US-made~ single axle cam line up.   While I like metolius (and wired bliss!)~ I'd love to have just a simple~ single stem~ single axle cam that is down-to-earth durable and has some different sizing (I'm not impressed with the new C4's durability~ I think they've definately under-engineered them now after seeing some broken ones- though the weight is nice and these exceptions are on the rarer side).   I've also wondered why cam companies havent come up with an ""opposite"" sizing.  IE~ take their current line up and simply split the differences of the cams and come with a ""staggered"" set.  That way you could stay with the same brand~ but have complimentary sizes.",Jun 2009,Mar 31 2011,0
9127,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,3,4, Hey Phil~ I didn't own a full set but I owned the teal cam (can't recall the number) and found that after about as many uses as you've put it through it started to take a CCH alien approach to the lobes (i.e. they started to flatten out). I don't know if it's because the material used is close to the material used by CCH~ or if it was just my cam. Did you see any of this?   As for the made in America argument going on~ don't a majority of companies still have US facilities? I thought BD still had a US manufacturing facility~ they just outsourced the R&D to China.,Dec 2010,Apr 1 2011,0
9128,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,3,5, Excellent review and really well done.  Makes me happy to see someone approach things with an open mind and realize none of this is rocket science~ so while they may look a little rough they'll work just fine.   -aric.,Sep 2008,Apr 1 2011,0

9131,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,3,8, Ah~ thanks for the clarification Jim.  I was going by memory of what I read a year or so ago and apparently got it wrong.  Oops!,Sep 2008,Apr 2 2011,0
9132,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,3,9, That´s o.k. the system is a bit confusing in the EU sometimes where there is a central government and a central civil service that make directives which the member states governments are supposed to include in their legislation. And often don´t or with their own interpretation or more usually by making the laws and not bothering to enforce them!   And the standardisation is a bit of a nightmare~ the classic example is the domestic electric plug/socket which a commitee spent 20 years and €200 million deciding on before abandoning the whole idea. We currently have 17 different systems and it looks like staying that way! (A bit of brute force or cutting/drilling usually makes them compatible though).   The maximum allowed curve for bananas has now been dropped so we can import South American ones but the one for cucumbers is still in force! Incidentally it is proposed to incorporate the EN´s into the ISO so they would then be international but we will wait and see on this one~ a lot of vested interests involved and questions of who is going to volounteer to give up power and influence.

9144,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,4,1, Without having too much of an opinion concerning domestic vs. foreign goods~ I do notice that the main cam axle is most likely threaded (since it appears to have nylock nuts on both sides of the cam holding the lobes in place).  In comparison to BD cams~ which have a solid~ most likely machined axle with cir-clips keeping everything in place~ Gear4Rocks cams would~ in theory~ have higher stress concentrations at the threads.  Specifically~ where the threads end and the smooth segment of the bolt begins.  This could weaken the axle in shear~ which seems really scary considering the fall-stopping success of the cams is dependent upon this strength.  This of course does not pose a problem if the bolt strength in shear meets or exceeds the safety factor for the particular cam.  Would another (more experienced) engineer challenge me on this?  I just graduated~ so I don't claim to know much.,Oct 2010,Apr 20 2011,0
9145,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,4,2, Not an engineer~ but to stop a fall~ aren't the forces on any cam's axle down in the middle and up where the lobes connect?  Unless the threads extend from the end of the axle to under the lobes~ they aren't involved in shear?  Said another way~ the ends of the axle aren't weight bearing~ so does it matter if they have threads?   Edit:   Oops~ I guess shear force is parallel to the axle.  So I see why that would be bad.  When the cam is loaded~ how much force ends up on whatever is retaining the lobes?,Apr 2010,Apr 20 2011,0

9153,Gear4Rocks Links Cam Review,4,10, Hey... I'm happy to see a full review of this set of cams. I bought a full set (aluminum nuts and link cams) last year. I want to show you what looked like the #5 cam (red) when I received it (brand new). You will all understand that I never used this cam with this major casting failure.  I'm seriously questioning the quality control. It should have never been shipped to a customer.    Of course~ I've asked for a replacement... And never received it!  They (Ana) told me 3 times my replacement cam was on it's way. That way a year ago.     Beside~ I must admit~ I really like my nut set (aluminum).

9164,5.10 Galileo Verdict?,1,0, Anyone tried them? How do they compare to similar models? The anasazi vcs? What do you guys use them for?    How is the sizing on these compared to street size?   Much appreciated~   -Eric,Apr 2013,Apr 30 2014,0
9165,5.10 Galileo Verdict?,1,1, I really like my Galileos~ I wear the same size as my street shoe size and they're tight but comfortable. I wear them for face climbing~ never in cracks.   I thought 5.10 discontinued the Galileo this year~ so if you decide you like them... buy a couple pair.,Dec 2010,Apr 30 2014,0
9166,5.10 Galileo Verdict?,1,2, They are a bit stiffer than Anasazi VCS or Verde~ but I find that you can still smear with them. They also have a more normal shaped heal (lower volume).    I wear a 45 street shoe and own Galileos in both 43 and 44. 43s are for thin edging (think New River Gorge or Mill Creek). 44s are for longer routes that have a bit of crack. Maybe the Needles in CA or even High Sierra routes.  They are stiff enough to support my feet for all day climbing~ comfy in cracks~ and still edge well. Also smear better in 44.   But I am almost positive they are discontinued so when mine are too shreaded to resole I will have to find something else.,May 2009,Apr 30 2014,0
9167,5.10 Galileo Verdict?,1,3, I picked up a pair each of Galileo's and Anasazi VCS's during 5.10's close-out sale at the end of the year not knowing which I'd like better.   So far I've left the Anasazi's in the box due to the shape of the heel.  Trying them both on out of the box~ the Galileo's fit my feet much better. The heel on the Anasazi's dug into the Achille's tendon too much for my liking.    I've been climbing in the Galileo's in the gym over the winter and I really like them.  I wear a 9 street shoe and got both pair in 8.5.  They were pretty tight at first~ but are breaking in nicely.  They edge really well and I'm anxious to try them outside soon. No compliants here.,Jul 2010,Apr 30 2014,0
9168,5.10 Galileo Verdict?,1,4, I'm on my 4th pair.  They are stiffer and less sensitive than the anasazi.  They edge well and are quite supportive.  I find the toes perform very well~ and they have a similar fit to the anasazi~ while the heel is comfortable~ but a little baggy.  They lack heel tension (which i like) but this means they don't heel hook very well~ I tend to start to pull my heel out of the shoe (maybe my technique is crap?).  I wear mine a half size larger than i do in a snug-but-not-too-tight VCS~ which i wear in my street shoe size of 11.5; i wear galileo's in a 12.  I tried 11.5's once but my toes would go numb.   They are my default shoe and i wear them for pretty much everything.  Durability wise~ 2 pairs of mine went thru 2 resoles before starting to completely fall apart.   It does appear they may be discontinuing them.,May 2010,Apr 30 2014,0

9176,Replacement for Scarpa Gecko Guides?,1,0, Alas~ my gecko guides are finally pretty much dead.  They are easily my favorite approach shoes ever: decent support~ climb nicely and have a low and soft toebox which makes them great for jamming.   Sadly~ Scarpa no longer makes them and I'm at a bit of a loss for a replacement.  I have a pair of la sportiva gandas~ but the toebox doesn't fit me as nicely as the gecko guides~ leaving me with bruised toes after a long approach.  What are people wearing for approach shoes that actually climb decently (say 5.9~ish face) while still being comfortable for daily wear and  approaches?   Anyone actually tried a pair of the Scarpa Vitamins?  Finally~ I can find the women's geckos in a 42 (my size).  Are they exactly the same design only in green?,Jun 2010,Mar 9 2014,0

I really wish Scarpa had something like the original generation of the Gecko Guides~ with the dot rubber on the bottom.  Mine are pathetically blown out after 3 or 4 years of heavy use~ but I refuse to retire 'em...keep them as short approach shoes.  Best approach shoe ever~ who says I can't have my cake and eat it too?  Stiff enough for Red Rock approaches but climbs very well (have climbed up to 10+ in them.)  My Guide Tennies are floppy and I may even unload them and just buy the damn Vitamins...,Mar 2010,Apr 24 2014,0

9185,Scarpa Gecko Guide,1,1, Haven't read the review~ but have had a pair for over a year.  I guide in Red Rock~ and the average approach shoe lasts 2-4 months.  They're light~ sensitive(like a durex)~ and climb quite well.  Better than I do~ really. I won't use them for hardcore bushwacking because I've put cactus spines through them~ but for anything else they're the BEST APPROACH SHOE I'VE EVER WORN.  Just sayin'...   oh yeah~ sizing is spot-on for me.  I have narrow feet~ and they fit like a glove.,Dec 2008,Nov 14 2011,0
9186,Scarpa Gecko Guide,1,2, I've got a pair.  They are awesome.  I sized them down a half size to get a more 'technical' sizing.  At first they were too tight and gave me a pressure blister on my heal and hurt my toes.  But with some stretching of the leather and some break in~ they fit perfectly.  But I would say the overall sizing of the shoe is spot on. I wear a 9.5/10 street shoe (43) and I bought a 42.5.    Great shoe.  Climbs very well and I will often climb lower grades in them and leave the rock shoes behind.  I wonder about the life span though.  I have only had them one month and could see them wearing out quickly. And with a big price tag~ thats not an easy pill to swallow (i got them discounted however).  Overall~ the best approach shoe I have ever had. Beats the LaSportiva Boulder X hands down.,Aug 2008,Nov 15 2011,0
9187,Scarpa Gecko Guide,1,3, I have a pair and I love them.   Sizing is dead on.   I have only owned one other pair of approach shoes~ but these shoes satisfy a requirement that I typically have for my gear:   I don't notice them.  That isn't to say that I don't notice that they do great things~ but I am not swearing about the shoes or minding them. Grab and go.     If you can find them at a discount (admittedly I got my own pair at an incredibly steep discount)~ I would not hesitate to buy them.  Excellent work by Scarpa.,Mar 2010,Nov 22 2011,0
9188,Scarpa Gecko Guide,1,4, I recently got a pair of these and am very impressed with the fit/feel as well as the build quality.

9192,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,0, I'm looking to replace my eleven year old 5.10 Newtons. I've tried several sizes of the Scarpa Techo with bad results. I own La Sportiva Miuras and love them. However~ I'm looking for a stiffer sole~ and~ I'm hesitant to spend over $150 on shoes. Perhaps that's what's happening these days...   Your thoughts~ good or bad~ regarding the Tradmaster is appreciated. I enjoy edging at Eldo to cracks/slabs in the Platte~ to the high peaks in RMNP.     -Thank you,Nov 2001,Feb 20 2011,0
9193,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,1, I bought some Tradmasters a while back and had two issues with them.    1. The lacing over the toes can be a bit weird and uncomfortable~ especially if you are going to be climbing thin hands cracks in them. Just make sure the toe-box feels okay for your foot when you try them on because they are quite different from other LS shoes I've owned.    2. They are lined with a soft fleecy material that gets pretty hot and slippery in the summer. I am prone to hot feet and mine would slide around making edging a less than precise affair.   My recommendation is to try them on and see what you think. If I didn't have these two issues - which may only relate to the shape and stankiness of my feet - then they probably would have been great shoes.    Also~ if you are ordering them online to try them on~ then my recommendation would be to try a half-size larger than your miuras. I wear a 45 Miura and the 45 tradmaster was just too small.   Hope that helps~    Doug.,Apr 2007,Feb 20 2011,0
9194,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,2, What's the price difference between a tradmaster and the shoe you really want on sale? I know everyone balks at high priced shoes but I've seen muiras for $100 and TC Pros for under $120 if you shop sales. It's just not that outrageous to me if you bargain hunt or buy shoes off MP where someone got the wrong size and they're not even broken in yet.,Oct 2007,Feb 20 2011,0
9195,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,3, Tradmasters are a very comfy crack shoe.  I replaced the rubber after 4 days of climbing because I was slipping on footholds I could stick easily with my Muiras.  **I know~ I know~ it could have just been crappy technique**   I asked the guy at Rock and Resole about the rubber and he said the TM's are made in China and the rubber could possibly contain contaminants or sub par ingredients whereas the Muiras are made in Italy.    With new rubber~ the shoe was fine.,Jan 2006,Feb 20 2011,0
9196,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,4, Got them several years ago and they are a comfortable shoe for my wide feet.  The only issue is the one mentioned above - not so sticky rubber.  I could smear better with my 5.10 approach shoes!  But being a beginning climber I wore them down fairly quickly and got them resoled (Rock and Resole).

9198,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,6, not directly relevant to your question~ but my TC pros did a pretty excellent job as an “do anything” trad climbing shoe~ and didn't have the funky lining that the tradmasters do.

9210,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,18, Alright~ all you TC Pro lovers out there. What is the deal with the tongue of the shoe? That's all I can feel grinding into the top of my toes when I wear these. Does this eventually break in? Anyone else have this problem?,Apr 2007,Feb 21 2011,0
9211,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,19, I like the tradmasters.  I bought them for around 50$ on Sierra Trading Post~ and at first was skeptical about how good they would be.  Since~ and due to being a poor college student and not being able to afford another pair of shoes right now~  I've used them for up to 5.12 sport~ 5.11 trad~ numerous desert towers~ and bouldering~ which i majorly suck at~ up to v5.  While not as sensitive as other shoes they are half the cost of similar shoes.  I wouldn't pay full price for them~ but for what they are going for on sale they are a steal.  Finally they are mega comfortable~ a few weekends ago I spent about an hour hiking in them on a descent~ and they felt like an awesome approach shoe.  If you are strapped for cash I highly recommend them.  If not~ of course~ the TC pro will be a superior shoe.,Jun 2006,Feb 21 2011,0
9212,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,1,20, I have a pair of tradmasters~ I'll never buy another pair.  Terrible rubber (very slick~ no friction at all) and not very comfortable.  Seeing as I rate shoes on only 2 criteria~ performance and comfort~ the Tradmasters have been a major fail for me.     Also~ I've had 2 very disappointing experiences with Sportiva customer service in the recent past and don't think I'll be buying any more LS shoes in the future (after owning 2 pairs of Mantras~ 2 Miuras~ 3 Vipers~ Tradmaster~ Nepal EVO~ and Trango Prime).  Oh well La Sportiva~ it was nice while it lasted.  Your shoes do fit my foot real nice.   I sent out 6 pairs of shoes to be resoled (all the dead shoes from my past 4-5 years of climbing) and the next pair I buy new will probably be 5.10 galileos once the tradmasters die.,Nov 2009,Feb 21 2011,0

9219,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,2,6, I had the rubber replaced on my Tradmasters soon after getting them~ because I had heard about the poor rubber they come with. I think the Tradmaster is a comfortable all-day shoe. It smears well (with the new rubber resole) is comfortable in cracks~ but doesn't edge well. Still~ I think it is a decent shoe.,Nov 2009,Feb 10 2012,0
9220,La Sportiva Tradmaster shoe~ good or bad?,2,7, I have had the same pair of Tradmasters for about 3.5 years now and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM... granted~ they are the only pair of climbing shoes I have ever owned and so I can't really compare them to anything else. They have taken me up mountains across the country~ difficult and delicate sport climbs and... well I don't boulder much but most of all CRACKS!   1. They are extremely comfortable~ the lining can get pretty smelly but hopefully thats because you've been wearing them for hours on end... or years..   2. I'v had them resoled once and that was only because they had become so rounded off that I thought it would help with edging~ it did~ briefly but lets face it~ they are not edging shoes (regardless~ I use them for EVERYTHING) and I have to admit they did feel better once resoled~ although I never thought them to be slippery to begin with though.    I love my Tradmasters and being that I am just a poor if not more so then when I started climbing~ I would get them again. If I had more to spend it MIGHT be a different story.,Jan 2014,Mar 2 2014,0

9223,What kind of approach shoes should I get next?,1,0, I've currently got the 5.10 camp fours and I love them.  They are going to be worn out pretty soon and I'll be looking for a new pair of approach shoes in the next 6 months.  I like everything about the camp fours~ with the exception of their bulk and weight.  I climb a lot of multipitch grade III and grade IV's~ so clipping these shoes to my harness or putting them in a small pack takes up a lot of space.  My shoe size is 12.5 US Men's~ so I know my shoes will be large regardless~ but I was going to see if anyone had a suggestion to drop some weight or save some space inside the pack.,Jun 2012,Jan 29 2014,0
9224,What kind of approach shoes should I get next?,1,1, The evolv cruizers pack down real small~ but they are also made of floppy canvas and pretty unsupportive as a result. But~ a long as you aren't carrying 40+lbs~ you'll be good. And they are super cheap right now,Apr 2013,Jan 29 2014,0
9225,What kind of approach shoes should I get next?,1,2, I think you need to get 2 shoes~ one nice solid shoe like the camp 4 and one small-packable shoe for descents.   I wear a 13/14 and have had the same issue with carrying shoes while climbing. Right now I have a pair of these:leftlanesports.com/product.…   They work okay because they are light~ have sticky rubber and are made to be folded~ unfortunately they are too wide for me.   If I was to do it over I would probably buy the Evolv Cruisers~ but only use them for descents since they look goofy and they don't appear to last very long.,Oct 2006,Jan 29 2014,0
9226,What kind of approach shoes should I get next?,1,3, If you want something with more support and a bit burlier than Evolv Cruzers~ check out Guide Tennies by Five Ten or Sportiva Gandas (pricey).

9227,What kind of approach shoes should I get next?,1,4," not ""approiach"" shoes but I have had and currently use brooks cascadias~ sturdy enough~ clip them to my harness and I barely notice them.

9228,What kind of approach shoes should I get next?,1,5, Another vote for the Cruzers from me. Perfect for clipping to your harness.

I am a diehard FiveTen user and have gone through several pair of Guide Tennies and I have to say that for a do it all shoe the Cragmaster has really impressed me.   Climbs better~ more comfortable standing in aiders.   It looks kinda goofy for an around town shoe but that might be ok for most climbers.   I wore them last month on Royal Arches and never had to put my climbing shoes on~ the Cragmaster felt solid the whole climb.,Apr 2012,Feb 19 2014,0

9239,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,0, both of these jackets have gotten great reviews and both companies have their jackets on sale for $180 right now.  my primary use for this jacket is running around town with a little outdoors mixed in.  im pretty torn on which jacket to get but im kind of leaning toward the BD stance.  it has a 40d nylon shell compared to the DAS having a 20d.  the DAS is ripstop but that doesn't really matter for around town.  the BD has 2 layers of 80 gram insulation so you get 160 total over the whole jacket.  the DAS has 120 gram on the whole jacket with an extra 60 gram on the chest.  another reason im leaning toward the BD stance.  im only concerned about warmth here.  i'd love everyones input~ on these two jackets only.  thanks all!!!  oh and not to be a pain but the sooner you can respond the better as I don't know when the sales will end.,Nov 2012,Feb 27 2014,0
9240,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,1, I would get whichever fits better. In my experience the Das Parka WAS HUGE! I normally wear a large in Patagonia and the medium was still quite big on me. BD clothes seem to be more fitted. . .   Also if you buy the BD jacket online it appears as though you could get one for around $114-$140 depending on size and color.,Oct 2006,Feb 27 2014,0
9241,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,2, If it matters to you~ Patagonia will actually repair their jackets at little or no cost. I have a few Patagonias~ and about once per year~ I package up any with rips or tears and they are returned a few weeks later~ beautifully (almost invisibly) patched. They've never charged me a dime~ though I'd happily pay.,Mar 2010,Feb 27 2014,0
9242,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,3, Both are great ice parkas~ but if you are worried with warmth~ then I think that the BD is a bit warmer (I have used both quite a bit).,Jul 2008,Feb 27 2014,0
9243,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,4, DAS would be warmer as Primaloft ONE is the warmest insulation per weight currently on the market besides down. Plus it costs more to manufacturers (Primaloft One that is). You get 180g insulation one third of which is way warmer(but lighter and less bulky) than Synergy that BD uses.,Sep 2008,Feb 27 2014,0
9244,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,5, doesnotcare where did you see the BD at those prices?  that sounds like a sweet deal.  and doligo for that jacket only the extra 60 grams on the chest is primaloft one~ the 120 grams on the rest of the jacket is synergy~ same as the BD.  I don't know which one would balance out as warmer.  and thanks j.albers~ I like knowing that you've had extensive use with both.,Nov 2012,Feb 27 2014,0
9245,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,6, DAS Parka 120g Synergy + 60g One = 180g insulation   Stance Belay 80g x 2 = 160g Synergy   180g (qualitatively superior) > 160 g   It doesn't really matter much if it's for wearing around town anyway and ultimately you can find the BD jacket for better price anyway.  Backcountrygear.com has them for $137.,Sep 2008,Feb 27 2014,0
9246,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,7, good point doligo but I think your right ill prolly go with the BD.  although backcountrygear has the parka for 180~ the stance hoody is 137.  thanks though for your help,Nov 2012,Feb 27 2014,0

9250,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,11, ^^ I would go with DAS then - 1 year vs. Lifetime Warranty~ and lighter weight of DAS.     J.Albers~ I've worn both.

9253,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,14, I think that the 'whichever fits best' advice is probably the biggest thing to consider.   I've had the Stance Belay Parka for a few months now and can confirm that it is damn~ damn~ damn warm. Sold the Mtn Hardwear Nilas jacket (as I live in the Pacific NW) and was at first very worried about the warmth and how it would compare. I've never been cold wearing it. In fact~ even standing still~ I've had to leave it open on occasion.    I absolutely love it. But with these two options~ how could you go wrong?   Oh yeah and this is definitely a belay parka~ and not a good piece to be used as part of your 'action suit'. 60-100g for that application.,Jun 2002,Feb 27 2014,0
9254,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,15, Backcountry.com lists BD's warranty as 1 year for all apparel. Don't know why would BD let that mistake fly like that unnoticed. Ok~ maybe they have a lifetime warranty (which we have yet to experience since they've been out on the market less than a year)~ I would still be a bit skeptical that a publicly-traded company would stick with unlimited warranty policies going forward...,Sep 2008,Feb 27 2014,0
9255,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,1,16, I too have had a BD Parka for a few months and I love it.    Its super warm. I used it in Ouray as it was truly intended~ an over everything else warm layer~ and was pleased.    I'm 6'0 and 155. Jacket fit over baselayers~ a soft shell and helmet with no problem and shed snow easily. I have a medium and haven't wished I had a small. That being said its a big coat. Super puffy obviously and comes down to my butt. If you plan on packing it along with much of anything else~ you'll need to put it in a compression sack.    My complaints might be that the chest pockets are kinda low down~ they bottom out just above my hip line. They are big though~ which is probably an advantage. I've found the media pocket kinda useless~ an iPhone with a case doesn't fit in it very well. Useful for chapstick and other small things though.    I was sleeping in my car in Ouray. I slept in this jacket like a baby for five nights. I was plenty cozy while my 26 liter water jug froze solid.,Apr 2011,Feb 27 2014,0

9260,BD stance belay parka or Patagonia DAS parka?,2,0, Somewhat off topic~ but if you are open to other suggestions for a belay jacket..   I found I really like using two thinner jackets.  I use a Rab Generator Alpine (100g/m2 body) and a Brooks Range Cirro Hoodie (60g/m2 all) which combines to be an extremely warm and more versatile system.  Both use PL1 which is a rarity these days.  Obviously a little more to deal with compared to having just one thick jacket~ but I don't think I'll ever go back to one big thick one.  Lots of good options for thinner synthetic jackets from La Sportiva~ Montbell~ Rab~ NW Alpine~ Brooks Range~ Arcteryx~ etc.,Oct 2010,Feb 27 2014,0

I've used it on multiple day backpacking trips where I've even strapped my wifes pack to the top with the strap that is designed to hold a climbing rope. Real strong cordura. I've used it a lot of hauling over basalt new routing~ and it's held up well. The straps tuck away real fast and easy. This thing is a dream. Been worth every nickle I payed and then some.    I also own the Fish bag. It doesn't carry nearly as well. Doesn't have a lid on top and holds much less: but it will outlive you and the hauly. It's much much cheaper too.

9277,NEW Black Diamond Fusion Ice Pick,1,0, www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/technical-ice>>>    So I saw this on BD's website yesterday and was curious about how well these work work on the Fusion's. I had a nice day trip down to Ouray today and Ouray Mountain Sports happened to have them in stock so I said what the hell I'll try them out.    These new Fusion Ice Picks have a 2 degree less pick angle than the standard Fusion Pick. It was obvious right away that Black Diamond designed a pick to climb ice with the Fusion and do it really really well. My climbing partner had a pair of Nomics so I was able to do a side by side comparison.    I have to say that the new Fusion Ice Pick is nothing short of AMAZING! My Fusions were climbing ice with the same ease as climbing with a pair of Nomics. Every stick was so easy and it was very obvious that Black Diamond did a good job designed a pick specifically for climbing ice with the Fusions.    The Nomic does have the pick weight that can be removed so the Nomic has more options as well as a slightly different swing than the Fusion but I have to say that the Fusion with the Fusion Ice Pick is a direct competition for the Nomic for ice climbing. I was able to climb ice with the same ease as any modern ice tool. All Fusion owners will be super psyched to put a pair of these on and get some longs days of pure ice with them.    Thanks to Black Diamond for hitting the nail right on the head with these new picks!!!!!!,Jul 2007,Jan 24 2013,0
9278,NEW Black Diamond Fusion Ice Pick,1,1, How do they compare with using laser picks on your fusions?,Apr 2006,Jan 31 2013,0
9279,NEW Black Diamond Fusion Ice Pick,1,2, The laser pick does climb ice better than the fusion pick but the fusion ice pick climbs ice much better than the laser pick.  The tip of the laser pick and the fusion ice pick are just about the same but I noticed an improvement when swinging into ice because of the pick angle being right on for the fusion.,Jul 2007,Jan 31 2013,0

9282,NEW Black Diamond Fusion Ice Pick,1,5, I'm running the new Fusion Ice picks on my green Fusions and they're awesome. Their performance on ice is much better than Laser or Fusion picks~ displacing noticeably less ice and requiring far fewer swings.   Also of note~ BD has their picks just about dialed in my opinion right from the factory. I used to spend a decent amount of time filing their picks to get the diamond shape on the teeth they're now coming with. I still tune up the Laser and Fusion picks by adding a little extra hook on the beak and second tooth. I was pleasantly surprised to see these new Fusion Ice picks are exactly what I've been tuning my other picks into.,Feb 2011,Nov 20 2013,0

9293,Grivel G12,2,1, I would definitely start in the G 12 it is a great steep ice crampon.  You wont have any problem climbing through WI5+ with them and you should be able to do mixed in them too if you want.   Dallen,Aug 2006,Jan 7 2014,0
9294,Grivel G12,2,2,,Feb 2010,Jan 8 2014,0
9295,Grivel G12,2,3, G12 is fine.  Horizontal front points give you better purchase and stability in most ice conditions~ especially when its chandeliered and funky.  The only advantage to vertical front points (Cyborg~ Dart~ Rambo~ etc) is in dense~ bullet-hard ice when the G12 points will take more work to penetrate.   If you want to buy another pair of crampons~ then by all means do so.  It's practically the American Dream.  But your G12s will not hold you back on 90% of waterfall ice.,Nov 2009,Jan 8 2014,0

9307,Dewalt 20Volt Rotay Hammer Drill,1,9, Yea battery and charger not included ~ so I guess this thing will cost as much as a Bosch by the time you purchase the battery n charger . Damn I was hopin for a less expensive replacement for the 500.00 Bosch . We're not even going to mention a hilti.    As far as the 36v is concerned ~ I've owned 2 new bosch hammer drills and I can honestly say I've never quite got 20 holes in good  solid granite before the thing started chugging down n drilling like shit . This is with the el cheepo ( 7.00 bucks at home depot) bits mind you ~ could never really see the point in spending upwards of 40.00 per bit for the drilling I was doing as none of it involved placing protection bolts . All that being said sounds like a pretty sweet deal for someone like yourself with battery's and charger to spare .    If I was in the position your in with the charger n batteries I'd prolly pull the plug n buy one and if it held up like a Bosch or hilti then bonus !,Oct 2007,Nov 24 2013,0

At work I am constantly recharging them. Would not plan on using these to build sport routes~ but a ground-up~ occasional bolt route would be OK.

9310,Dewalt 20Volt Rotay Hammer Drill,1,12, I have an older DeWalt 18V drill which came with 2 nicad batteries.  It works fine but nowhere near as good as my friend's 36V Bosch drill.   I had a battery pack die on me and bought one of these batteryship.com/htmlos/html… which I am very happy with.   I got 7 3/8 - 3 inch holes yesterday with the nicad battery pack in hard granite.  I expect that I should get 11 or 12 holes with the LiIon pack which is also lighter.,Feb 2006,Dec 24 2013,0
9311,Dewalt 20Volt Rotay Hammer Drill,1,13," I actually got the 18V NiCad.  Just realized that.  Dunno~ I bolted with it all fall for 4 or 5 hours at a time and never had to switch a pack.  That was using 12mm and 3/8"" bits.  It only takes about 10 seconds to drill a hole that's say 5"" deep.  Takes longer to clean it out.  60 seconds = 6 holes~ say the thing will run for 20 min on a single pack~ I doubt you'll be drilling more than 30 or 40 holes in a day???  It works fine for me and my buddies that set lines.  Amazon has a 1 yr return~ send it back if it doesn't do the job and save the $250.

The battery life wasnt bad~ but the owner did have to retire his batteries way too quick.   I think the Bosch is still the best buy for the price~ (Bosch 36V ) all things considered.    If price is a main driver...get a used Bulldog on ebay and supercharge it.  Some of the guys at work have been buying them up and making kits for about $120-140 total.  And the setups are really nice ( SuperTopo beta  )~ the weight is in your pack and the drill is nice and light when you're bolting above or behind your head.    One interesting drill that came to my attention~ albeit much heavier~ is this guy:  http://www.amazon.com/Makita-HRH01ZX2-18-volt-Cordless-Lithium-Ion/dp/B00A9930UO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1388767359&sr=8-2&keywords=makita+cordless+36v+hammer+drill+uses+two+18v+batteries   Kind of a cool concept.,Jul 2012,Jan 3 2014,0

Mobility (I am primarily looking for something that fits trim in the torso and arms)   I'll mostly use it as an action suit top when doing some winter hiking~ snowshoeing/trail skiing or late-fall/early-spring cragging.   Thanks in advance.,Nov 2012,Dec 22 2013,0
9330,Rab Xenon vs Arcteryx Atom LT Hoody,1,1," I love my Atom LT Hoody! It's super light/comfortable and seems to be much warmer then other jackets of the same weight. The jacket is a trim fit but somewhat shorter at the waist making it tough to keep under a harness. I have never worn the Rab Xenon but do love my Rab gear; mostly for the simple fact that it's not common amongst the ""yuppies"" like Arcteryx is becoming. In my opinion I'd get the Atom but I don't see how going for a Rab product would disappoint either.",Jun 2013,Dec 23 2013,0
9331,Rab Xenon vs Arcteryx Atom LT Hoody,1,2, The atom lt is an insulated piece designed for movement in cold temperatures~ while the xenon is a designed as an insulation piece~ but not necessarily an active insulation piece.

9348,Goal Zero Sherpa 50,1,0, It’s not often that I find myself mapping 1300 year old villages~ but when I do~ Goal Zero~ coffee~ and goat cheese curds powers my day.  Pictured here is the Sherpa 50 battery with the Nomad 27 panel linked to a Topcon total station.   In this section I will focus on the Sherpa 50 battery and not the associated solar panel.     For a little bit of context~ I conduct archaeological research in remote regions of Mongolia.  We have an extremely large power budget~ fueling numerous computers~ GPS units~ iPads~ phones~ cameras~ and other types of equipment for a very large group.  Equipment~ in order of importance~ is: 1) computers; 2) iPads; 3) GPS units.  To meet our power requirements~ we also use the now discontinued Sherpa 120 and the Extreme 350 battery (and a generator for rainy days).  Of the three solar batteries~ I think the Sherpa 50 is the most useful.  I say this because of its light weight~ quick recharge time~ and number of smaller electrical items that can be recharged from one power cycle of the battery.    Because the computers are the most important item for our daily operation we mainly reserve the Extreme 350 and Sherpa 120 for powering them (these are also great batteries and we still sneak in a GPS unit or two on the power strip running off the 350)~ as such these batteries are stuck at base camp constantly cycling through various states of charge.  The Sherpa 50 fills in nicely because it can quickly power an item~ be taken into the field where it can be recharged in a morning or afternoon and then either provide an important ‘top-off’ charge that allows us to finish a day of work~ or be taken back to camp to power a second item that night.  The only slight drawback is that the power button is a bit touchy and can give you a little trouble turning off but nothing that would reduce the overall ranking of the product.  At the end of the day~ it is a good product – okay~ maybe not as good as goat cheese curds but at least it leaves your breath a whole lot fresher.          Mongolian Steppe,May 2007,Nov 21 2013,0

9359,Rope Bags,1,5, +1 for the Metolius Ropemaster - classic bag that's been around forever for good reason. I love the large built in tarp w/end tie offs and the double compression straps with the indestructible metal buckles - cinches down tight - simple design. The plastic buckles like on the Arcterx bag and others - ultimately you will step on and crunch them when hopping around putting your shoes on standing on the tarp at the base of the climb. Also the thing I like about the large rectangular Metolius tarp design is that you can flake the rope out in the center~ fold in the sides and roll it up into the bag - next time you go to use the rope~ unroll and ready to go~ no flaking necessary. The Haku looks like you just dump it all into a big knot.   I personally don't really get the hype with the Ikea bags either. No tarp~ no compression straps...yes they cost $0.59 but that seems like $0.59 to much for me - I get basically the same utility for free by just stuffing the rope in my backpack..?,Mar 2011,May 29 2013,0

9363,Rope Bags,1,9, I have both the Metolius and BD Superslacker rope bags~ and like the Superslacker much better.  It's easier to roll up and zip~ rather than wrapping up the rope and trying to roll and stuff it into the bag like the Metolius.  The Superslacker also swallows 70m single or 60m doubles easier.,Nov 2007,May 29 2013,0
9364,Rope Bags,1,10, Hayley~    What are you planning on doing with the rope bag? Do you need the capacity to carry doubles? 70m? 60m? short or long approaches? Multi-pitch? Etc. If you're just looking for something to lay on the ground for short-approach crag days~ I'm inclined to agree with the IKEA bag and supplemental tarp or something super cheap and easy. If that's not quite appealing~ then cheap is the way to go provided the bag is large enough to carry whatever rope you tend to crag with (if you crag with a 10+mm 70m rope some bags might be too small to be convenient).    For longer approaches~ etc. I've been sold on bags that have two straps (and thus wear like a backpack) rather than one. This is especially true if you're doing multi-pitch stuff where it's nice to carry some water~ food~ sandals/shoes for the descent since you can just bring the rope bag on the climb.    I wrote up a review of two metolius rope bags I bought a while back if you're interested in greater detail:  blistergearreview.com/gear-…   though I should add that the newer version (since I bought mine) of the Porta-cord is made with slightly beefier material and has a slightly larger tarp than the one in the review.    good luck!,Feb 2010,May 29 2013,0

9367,Rope Bags,1,13, +1 on the IKEA bag. I've been using one for a year or so and it's holding up really well. You can fold the top edge over a couple inches and it stays open so you can use it like a giant rope bucket (belay directly out of the bag)~ it doesn't gather dirt like a tarp flat on the ground does~ it's got 2 different length of handles for carrying and/or tying the end to~ and you can throw in your shoes/draw/etc. to move short distances between climbs at the crag.   Oh yeah~ did I mention that they're $0.59?   I own a couple other rope bags~ including a metolius~ and I haven't used any of them since picking up the IKEA bag.,May 2010,May 29 2013,0

9370,Rope Bags,1,16, the ikea bag IMO is superior to a tarp/rope bag because    -its easier to flake the rope directly in the bag when you pull it   - for that climb a few metres away you can just carry the bag~ no need to grab the edges of the tarp   - its much lighter   - want to carry the bag a decent distance? ... just roll it tight and stuff it in yr pack or strap it to the top   - its one dollah up here in the land of maple syrup ... you can spend that 30-40$ you saved on real gear that will save your life~ or help you climb harder   - thumb yr nose at those evil outdoor companies that try to tell you gear you dont need   ;),Mar 2009,May 29 2013,0
9371,Rope Bags,1,17, The Elderid bag i mentioned has like a 6x6 tarp after opened. Its pretty big and whats even better is~ as long as your rope is on the tarp itself~ pick up the corners and itll slide right into the bag.

9381,Rope Bags,2,6, I usually carry the rope in the bottom of my pack.  I am better able to compress the rope and maximize the volume of my pack without a rope bag.  It is nice to have a tarp on which to lay the rope while climbing.  For this I use a cheap tent footprint that I got at REI Outlet for about $4.  This solution works well for me.  I see the nifty rope bags from Metolius and BD as unnecessary pieces of kit that just add weight to your pack and cost $ that could be spent on beer.,Dec 2009,Oct 25 2013,0

9384,Rope Bags,2,9, Probably already mentioned but my friend has the Eldrid caddy and it is an excellent bag!!! It easily stores and carries his 9.4 60m rope with room left over. The main thing I like about it is how it is a cross between a shallow bucket an a tarp~ making it super easy to flake out the rope and pack it up really small. It keeps your rope out of the dirt~ mud~ and shrubs~ and it is durable and easy to use.,Dec 2012,Nov 16 2013,0
9385,Rope Bags,2,10, I don't coil my rope anymore when cragging.  It sits in the bottom of my pack wrapped up in a tarp.  The tarp has two tabs~ each marked with sharpee: 'top'~ 'bottom'.  I keep each end of the rope tied to one of the tabs.  The top and bottom ends switch regularly~ and it's very easy to tell which is which~ and keeps it easy to track how many times each end has been led on or fallen on.     Tying the ends in this fashion also prevents the rope from tying knots in itself.  It also is an easy way to keep the end knotted without having to think too much about it when working single pitches.  If you already have a pack~ don't buy a rope bag~ just buy a rope tarp with tabs.  I promise I don't work for a rope tarp company.  I just feel that rope bags are kind of a waste of money.   Or just buy an ikea bag.,Aug 2008,Nov 16 2013,0

9387,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,1, Nate~ thanks for the comment. Pulling the cam back and pressing the little button (which has a pretty strong spring and is really small) requires a fair bit of dexterity for me. I don't doubt your experience~ but I'm just curious how exactly it happens?   I like when people disagree with things I put in my reviews as it gives others more than one perspective to inform their purchasing and usage decisions.,Jun 2001,Aug 19 2013,0
9388,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,2, Great review. The pulley efficiency of the micro is amazing. It really takes the sting out of the first few day or two of hauling.  I'm also going to try your solo setup. It sounds like it would work really well.,Mar 2007,Aug 19 2013,0
9389,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,3," Excellent work Josh!   On your rope solo technique you said;    ""I use a steel quicklink to attach a Petzl Croll to my belay loop - this devices is held in position with a length of bungee cord that goes over my neck (tip: REI sells cotton bungee cord which is way more comfortable than anything nylon) - this is my primary progress-capture. Below this I have my backup: also clipped to my belay loop using a twist-lock 'biner~ I drag the Micro Traxion up below the Croll. This setup feeds incredibly smoothly and is worry-free.""   I bought the Mini Traxion last spring and plan on using it to solo ice routes this winter.   Your technique seems to vary from what Petzl recomends in their literature~ unless I am not seeing properly?    Any chance you could post an illustration or picture of this set-up? How do you keep from inverting with the Croll and Traxion so low?   Thank you in advance.

9395,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,9, @Locker and SavageMarmot:   The illustration you posted is the one I was referring to~ and planning to use.   I think this is the method Josh is describing minus the bungee cord?  Attached to belay loop with locker as primary with secondary trailer below   I thought this was better suited for 2 ropes where I wish to only use one.   Did any of you file off the cam locking lever to avoid accidental opening?    I was thinking this would primarily be an issue with rock climbing rather than ice climbing since body positioning is further away from the medium?   Thanks again for the review Josh!,Feb 2010,Aug 22 2013,0
9396,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,10, Tom~   I have not filed off the button and see no need to. I've used Mini Traxions for TR soloing (A lot!) since they came out and haven't had a single problem (Probably will now the very next time out).   The illustration you posted above is CLOSE to what I do when I use two ropes. Only difference for me is I run one off a chest harness & belay loop~ and one only on the belay loop~ each on a separate rope. ...,Oct 2002,Aug 22 2013,0

9398,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,12," Hi Josh~   Thanks for the review.  Two questions:   1)  Is there a reason that you use the Croll rather than the Micro Traxion as the primary device?     2) Do you usually use a static or a dynamic line with these~ or is either fine in your book?   Cheers~   dh   PS~ Uli says hi~ and is psyched to get out with you when you get back this way.  He's been browsing through the guidebook and says that ""Three Doves"" and ""Bunny"" look most interesting to him.",Aug 2007,Nov 13 2013,0
9399,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,13," Dear Optimistic:   1) I use the Croll because it is designed to be oriented high and in conjunction with a chest harness (or as I use it~ with just a simple loop of bungee cord which I put over my head). Because the Croll is above the belay loop and not dragged behind underneath it~ the device locks off the moment you fall or sit on the rope - thus avoiding what I call the dreaded ""mini-whipper"". The mini-whipper is that 8-12"" fall that occurs while a device dragging underneath your belay loop moves upwards before engaging and locking-off. During that split second I find there is a tremendous amount of anxiety as you do not know if it will actually catch. With the Croll~ feedback is immediate.   There are other advantages too: It is very light~ small~ and easy to engage and disengage from the rope - much more so than the Micro.   2) With the Croll as primary~ static and dynamic are perfectly fine. If I was to use a setup where I'd take the ""mini-whipper"" I'd prefer dynamic. However~ it's important to understand that even static ropes do have some stretch~ and taking a little 8"" fall on static (so long as you're not right at the anchor where there's not much rope out to stretch) is probably just fine. Static does have certain advantages: it is stiff and feeds really well~ you don't loose progress due to stretch~ and it's quite durable. These don't necessarily outweigh the versatility of dynamic ropes though and usually I TR solo with my retired lead lines.   Please give my best to Uli. Tell him to respect the sherpas when they're fixing lines and to keep his litterbox clean.",Jun 2001,Nov 13 2013,0
9400,Gear Review: Petzl MICRO TRAXION,1,14, Every time I TR with a mini I experience the feeling that this might be the day that I die - usually a few seconds before I leave the ground for my first pitch of the day.   My antidote to this feeling is to think of the thousands of pitches logged by Yosemite hardpeople on single mini's up on El Cap. Look at Caldwell's setup on the Dawn Wall in this vid for an example (at about 1:25): youtu.be/i9tc07mcJZE   I'll never be confident enough to use a single mini~ but knowing that others do without issue gives me peace in my time at Arch and the Cookie.,Nov 2003,Nov 13 2013,0
9401,Arc'teryx Cam SV gloves,1,0, Picked up a pair yesterday~  not cheap but they seem to fit really well.    Intended purpose is to add to my collection of ice climbing gloves (most bought on sale).   Montreal has a pretty limited collection of technical ice gloves so finding properly fitting ones only comes once in a while.

I love them~ they fit my hand well without a ton of extra material at the tip of each finger like most other brands (especially BD).  I think the Venta is more-or-less identical to the Cam except made with insulated Windstopper whereas the Cam is a stretch woven softshell.   Was actually thinking about grabbing a pair of the Cams since they'd probably breath better than the Ventas which can tend to get a bit clammy on warmer days.   The price is steep for the gloves but the incredible comfort and dexterity makes up for it~ for me at least.,Jul 2011,Oct 27 2013,0

9411,Trying to get rating on 4lb. Down bag,1,6," When mountaineering~ I'll use a lighter sleeping bag and sleep in a puffy jacket and down booties. A puffy+booties are a must anyway for cooking~ getting up at night~ belaying~ emergency sitting bivies~ getting ready in the morning.... and will greatly boost the temp rating of any bag.    The collar~ hood and shoulders of a puffy jacket do an amazing job of keeping cold air from getting into a mummy bag (only the coldest bags have an integrated collar). Plus~ if it's not bitter cold in the tent~ you can unzip the bag~ wear it as a blanket and spread out your arms/elbows however is most comfortable.     For the lower half of the body~ there are many options: fleece pants (which are nice to have anyways)~ a half bag liner~ down suit/pants (if it's really cold)....   Test the system out in your backyard without a tent~ which will be 10-20 degrees colder than with a tent~ and see how it works.   BTW~ In Peru I used a 30deg bag~ warm puffy~ booties~ fleece pants and Bibler tent (+1 partner)~ and was fine on a multi-day 6300m route that got pretty cold. Also~ I found that my puffy did a better job than my sleeping bag of staying dry since it would air out with a warm body inside when getting ready in the morning~ as opposed to a bag which immediately cools off when you're not in it and gets stuffed right away into a stuff sack. A sleeping bag is hard to keep dry in cold conditions over the course of multiple days.   Oh~ and read Jack London's ""To Build A Fire"".",Oct 2007,Oct 23 2013,0

I've heard a lot about down booties~ So I guess it's time I got mine.

9420,Rab Latok Extreme Gaiter,1,0, Coming from the west I have discovered many interesting truths in life that few are aware of – e.g.  bored sheep herders like to stack rocks.  How is this important in the review of a gaiter?  We’ll get there~ but first let me ramble.   I am a PhD student in archaeology conducting research in a remote region of north central Mongolia.  Imagine the foothills of the Wind River Range - not so much the dune covered~ camel caravans~ region of the Gobi.     Despite what some movies have said about my profession~ I actually don’t get to spend a lot of time rescuing damsels in danger of having their hearts ripped out.  I chose a more tame side of the profession~ specializing in landscape archaeology.  Basically~ I spend a lot of time scientifically wanderings in the wilderness looking for remains of Mongolian sheep herders.  As such~ I have put my fair share of hiking equipment through the wringer.     In total~ the performance of these gaiters for hiking in variable terrain has been second to none.  The project area where I work gets a lot of summer moisture.  Despite long days tramping through knee high~ wet grass~ these gaiters have kept my feet nice and dry.  Similarly~ the body material of the gaiter has held up well in thick~ thorny~ underbrush.     I was a bit concerned with the durability of the strap that goes under the boot.  Hundreds of kilometers of hiking later & these things are still going strong.  Granted~ the hiking has been mostly in grass/dirt terrain~ however~ (if you recall my earlier nugget of wisdom) I do feel confident saying that the lower strap will handle rocky situations also.  Why? As it turns out~ the Mongolian sheep herders of antiquity took rock stacking to new heights.  These guys are the proud creators of huge rock monuments (10’s of meters)~ boat loads of rocks.  Spending days recording these monuments has roughly approximated scrambling over a talus field so I do feel confident that the gaiter will last 307andbeyond.tumblr.com  Two toddler thumbs up.,May 2007,Oct 17 2013,0
9421,La Sportiva Pamir - Giant Steppe Up,1,0, After writing down several ‘step’ (“one small step…” or “following in the steps of greatness”) and ‘boot’ (“these boots were made for walking…” or “put on your sh$t kickers…”) styled puns; I have decided that the winner is……..  These boots are a giant ‘steppe’ up from anything else I have ever worn!  Get it?  Steppe!  Sorry~ I work in Mongolia so I ‘plague’ everyone with ‘steppe’ puns.  Yeah I know - not funny.   Before I jump into my review~ I want to quantify my usage.  I am a graduate student working on my PhD in archaeology.  I conduct my field research in the middle of nowhere Mongolia.  Sadly~ I do not get to carry a whip or a gun and I have never had to run from poisonous dart blowing natives.  I do~ however~ direct a substantial survey project in the mountainous northern regions of Mongolia.  As part of this project I hike several kilometers each and every day for several months each summer.  Needless to say I have gone through my fair share of hiking boots and as such~ I feel well qualified to talk to the greatness of the Pamir boot.   First~ I should say that I have a high arch and a moderately narrow foot.  With this in mind~ the boot was a great fit right out of the box.  More impressive was the fact that they needed relatively little break in time.  While prepping for a two-month foray into the Mongolian wilderness I accidently forgot to get boots until the last minute.  As such~ I pretty much got them in the mail~ threw them on~ and headed to the airport.  Despite the lack of a proper break-in period~ my feet felt great from the get go; eight to ten hours of straight hiking over variable terrain did not tax my feet during the first work week.  I will say that I also attribute this to good sock selection (Vermont’s very own Darn Tough - great sock).  However~ the overall ankle support and supportive foot bed are the main reasons my feet felt fine during the first real break in week and over the course of the entire project.   Water proofness of the boots is also a big thing for me.  The project area consists of tall grasses and just a little rainstorm will soak the grasses for long periods.  In the past~ rainy nights would saturate the grass and result in wet feet despite bright sunny days.  I did treat the leather a little before heading into the field and when combined with a good set of gaiters~ these boots would keep my feet high in dry despite hours in soaking wet grass and/or hours of tromping through set summer snows (yes it snows in the summer in Mongolia).     Overall~ I cannot say enough good things about these boats.  Totally worth the money; the comfort~ waterproofing~ and thus far durability~ are amazing. 307andbeyond.tumblr.com  Waiting on a connection - Incheon International Airpot,May 2007,Oct 7 2013,0

I bought some old slightly beat~ no slings on them Metolius 4 cam units off the internet~ sent them in for new slings~ and turns out they can also recondition them to be near new.    My son got them for Christmas. LOL It helps me to sleep at night knowing that they have a better cam angle and thus will stick better than most cams out there.    I've heard it said that they won't send a cam back if it is so beat to shit that they fear it may fail on you~ and I think that's a bullshit policy if true. It's your damned cam~ if you want to hang it off your rear view mirror or take monster climbing whippers on it~ it's your call. They have a responsibility to say ""DON'T CLIMB ON IT~ YER GONNA DIE"" but not to repo it~ which is essentially stealing it.

I sent it back to Metolius~ hoping that they would fix the cam for less than the cost of a new one (maybe $30-$40)   I was amazed when I got back the bill - $8   1. They replaced the broken cam lobe (and the swaged axle)   2. They replaced the trigger wires (which I didn't even ask for)   3. They replaced the sling (which i also didn't ask for)   So I got my cam back in the mail and it was brand new! They definitely did not make money on this transaction.

9486,.,3,19, Sounds like maybe some of you guys should be using thicker ropes or even static ropes.     In my mind a rope that needs retiring in a few weeks or a few routes without having undergone any trauma is not simply a badly made rope but a dangerous and defective one.  I would raise all holy hell with the manufacturer if that happened to me.  The ropes clearly don't live up to usual standards.

9492,.,2,4, Locker~ I'm not sure about the core and sheath materials~ but I do think the finishing coats that are on dry ropes must help a lot.     I have had great life out of my Mammut Infinity 9.5.  It has done so well over the last couple of years that I recently bought another one and it is still in the package waiting for my other one to finally die.     Mammut uses a couple different finishes.  I believe one is to increase durability and lessen drag~ the another is the dry coat.  The combination of the them seems to work quite well.,Sep 2008,Apr 23 2013,0
9493,.,2,5," My experience with Sterling is that the 9.8 Evolution Velocity and all of the Marathon series are VERY durable.  This is just my experience~ but they seem to last longer than any other rope I have used (with Mammut coming in as a close second).  My Sterling 10.1 is a workhorse that I cannot seem to kill.  Although it is by no means lightweight~ it is not so heavy that it reduces my performance on the rock.     The 9.2 and 9.4 are ""performance"" oriented ropes.  They are skinny~ lightweight~ and have very different wear characteristics than ""thicker"" ropes.  Although I have not seen anything like what Killis is describing~ in my experience the durability of the smaller ropes is significantly less than the other ropes produced by Sterling.  Regardless of manufacturer~ all the smaller ropes are always less durable.   My suggestion; give Sterling a call.  They seem to be a good company that stands behind their product.   Good luck and let us know what happens.",Dec 2009,Apr 23 2013,0

I bolted on rappel with an old 70 meter rope that I had had for a few years. I hid my brand new 70 meter rope underneath an overhang at the base of the climb. I would bolt the climb and then ascend back up with the new rope~ tie them together~ rappel back down~ and then pull my ropes.   When I got to the base of the climb~ a coil from the middle of my new rope had flipped outside of the overhang and a rock I had thrown off while bolting~ hit the rope and cut it in half!

9497,.,2,9, I agree that the tight weave helps with longevity. I recently bought a Maxim with the TPT single-weave sheath.

9499,.,2,11, It is funny to see the posts above.  5 pitches~ core shot~ no falls~ blah~ blah~ blah... I'm never going to buy this brand ever again.  If you read the rope forums you will see that someone~ somewhere core shoted most every rope out there.  And then says I'll never buy that brand ever again.  In another forum someone will say that is the best rope they have ever owned.   I'm not saying all ropes have the same durability.  Just that shit happens.  It only takes one little eff up to damage a rope.  And it is quite possible to not even know when it happens.  Sheath weave plays a major role in durability as well as handling and impact forces.    Generally speaking~ tight weaves are more durable with higher impact forces.   YMMV,Apr 2006,Apr 23 2013,0
9500,.,2,12, Locker:   Yes~ the weave patterns are different on the sheaths~ as well as waterproofing which can affect durability. neropes.com/product.aspx?mi…   I purchased a 9.9 x 70m bi color New England Glider~ and it is holding up well after about 20 climbs...I just use it for longer trad climbs.

But it's tamed now and doesn't kink like it used to.   If you look at reviews of the rope on REI's web page~ people's experience varies widely...one user had 130 days and still going strong...a couple others said it wore out quickly.    Seems like the biggest variable is the way people treat their ropes...   Maybe it's time to rethink the thin cord trend... if you are leading 30m (100 ft) sport climbs~ there's only a 1.1 pound difference between 9.9 and 11 mm~ so if the crux is at 50ft~ the 11mm is only 1/2 pound heavier than the 9.9...

9504,.,2,16, I've got no problem with the thin rope trend~ just use them as they should be used: for that desperate route you've been projecting for a week (on the final send)~ or for those long~ every-ounce-counts alpine climbs~ or for those folks who are total bad asses and never toprope.   That said~ a rope is a consumable item:  it's supposed to die~ so I don't sweat the wear and tear.   But it shouldn't die for no reason~ which is more or less what the original post is about. That would concern me~ and I'd contact the manufacturer just to make sure it wasn't some rare manufacturing defect. It's probably more likely that something bad happened to it and the poster did not notice at the time~ but the manufacturer should be clued in any way.   As soon as I can afford it~ I want a quiver of ropes: a thick and thin version~ say a 9.5 and a 10.5~  in lengths of 50m~ 60m~ and 70m. It's amazing how much of my local~ day-today cragging doesn't even need a 50m!   And I'll beat 'em up!   But I will wash them~ because I hate how dirty a dirty rope makes my hands.

The dude I spoke with immediately knew what the issue with my rope is and referred to it as ""Mouseing"" (Little lumps on the inside of the rope).    I will update as I get more info.    One thing the dude said and he said it in a way that makes me take him seriously. He flat out said~ ""Do NOT use the rope"". I asked a little more and he again emphasized to NOT use the rope.

First day....Took it to a basalt crag in Washington and accidentally dropped a rock on it from the rim.     Second fastest retirement was cleaning the second pitch of a project up at Mt. Charleston; after maybe 25 days of use.  My fault for leaving part of it lying on the belay ledge.  Should have hung the coils.  Partial core shot and we had to rap off it.   Kind of an unforgettable moment.   On durability my info is purely anecdotal. A Beal fuzzed out pretty fast but was sweet when new.  Blue Water seems to collect a lot of grime and aluminum oxide from the gear.  Edelweiss and Mammut seem to wear a long time; take a lot of abuse.  Best rope I ever owned was a Singing Rock.

We arrived stoked and ready to go. we harnessed up and my buddy pulls out a new rope still in the plastic and flakes er out.   He climbs first and while working the route misses a bolt and heads to the next one about 60 or so feet up.  He pops off of the crux and takes a good 30+ footer with a slight right trend to the route over a roof. The rope catches a flake/crystal/sharp something and with the pendulum along with the edge of the roof the rope gets striped  about two feet of the sheath exposing the core.

9552,5.10 Newton's,1,1, I think they are great for crack climbing and longer multipitch routes.  They are quite stiff~ so  definitely not the best shoe for small edging or high-performance~ but what is sacrificed here is gained in comfort.  The stiffness also means they need a bit of a break-in before they really get comfortable and fitted to your feet (maybe like 1-2 thousand feet of climbing ideally?)     I like the lacing system~ and with my feet~ they fit like gloves -- quite snug.  A buddy of mine has wide feet~ and barely can lace them shut~ but he still seems to enjoy the shoe.,Sep 2011,Aug 3 2013,0
9553,5.10 Newton's,1,2, They are great for long multipitch or crack climbing. Absolutely suck on overhanging or edging. Its not a sport climbers shoe.   They feel very comfortable for about 8 pitches. After that they start to hurt on the heel.,May 2012,Aug 3 2013,0

9557,5.10 Newton's,1,6," just want to chime in that i think the Newton is a great fitting all a rounder. i'm surprised folks find they lack for edging...? they are stiff and for me seem to hold a well placed foot on small edges with good success. Perhaps the stiffness gets in the way of some climbers ability to ""feel"" where they are on edge...? the torsional stiffness is a plus when stepping into wider cracks too. With laces running all the way to the toe~ and following an asymmetric curve to follow the natural shape of the foot~ many folks find a fine fit across many different foot shapes. Highly adjustable.   this lined shoe does NOT require much downsizing~ the heel is pretty low-volume~ and if you will be walking off routes~ might i suggest sliding the heel off your foot ( relieves toe pressure)~ folding under the heel and securing the upper eyelets of the lacing to add some padding underfoot. the bottom of the heel is very thin and can hurt if you jump down or step on a sharp.",Apr 2013,Aug 5 2013,0

When my R-260 (my previous harness) tie-in point failed after a little less than two years of use~ I sent it back to them. I was told that’s an average life-span for a harness. However~ my previous Arc’teryx harness~ the Vapor~ was purchased circa 1996 and still looks nearly new. I told them I was disappointed and that the quality seemed to be headed south if it fails this quickly. They offered to replace my harness. But with no more of that previous year’s model in stock~ they made another offer. The result? A brand new R-260-LT. good to see that they are still replacing em ... i did meet 2 climber this year where dead bird did not replace em ... its a good thing you have extra harnesses lying around or youd be out for 2-3 weeks   i find it quite interesting that again ... we have lower tie in failures on dead birds ... but you generally dont hear about it on things like BD harnesses which OUTSELL the dead birds greatly~ so theres more out there ...    whats absolutely amazing is that people are drinking the koolaid believing they are great harnesses ...    what ""great"" harness that cost $$$$ have so many reportedfailure problems with the tie in point vs cheaper harnesses half the price   ;)",Mar 2009,Jul 23 2013,0

It’s obviously a little heavier~ but I have no fear of the tie-in point problem because of the sweet plastic casing around it. And it is about half the price.

9589,So ILL Factory Seconds,1,1," I haven't had any myself~ but I sent them an email with similar questions.  Here's what they said to me:   ""Our seconds are great!  They are all usable on your wall and just have minor defects that need either some sanding order drilling in the bolt hole from some over pour of poly.""   Doesn't sound too bad~ but I decided against getting seconds because they seem to be more expensive than regular holds.  So Ill told me that 20lbs of seconds is about 30 to 40 pieces and that costs $140 not including hardware.  A starter kit with 43 holds and hardware is $159.  A So Ill Rep. told me that they usually put in a variety~ so I'm assuming you'll get a set of holds similar to their starter package. If you subtract the cost of the hardware from the starter kit (it's about $129.00) and then calculate the cost per hold the seconds actually end up costing between $0.50 and $1.66 more per piece than new holds. Even if you don't subtract the cost of the hardware you could end up paying more for seconds.",Aug 2012,Jun 7 2013,0
9590,So ILL Factory Seconds,1,2," Thanks for the response. Based on weight I think your logic seems a little off since the weight of the 99 piece starter kit weighs 16 lbs and is $239 according to their website.

Still~ I sent them an email and was told its a total crapshoot as to what you'll get~ whether its a ton of small holds or just a couple jugs (i guess worse case scenario you could get a bunch of footholds~ but Dan said that they try and put in mostly ""CD"" sized holds). Anyhow~ I think I may look into one of the smaller packages of seconds as well as a regular kit and see how it goes. Will post back here to let you all know what you can expect as far as quality goes and how much work needs to be done on the holds.",Aug 2010,Jun 7 2013,0
9591,So ILL Factory Seconds,1,3, I bought seconds' directly from them at the RRG Rocktober fest a few years ago. They were fine~ just had a burr of plastic on an edge~ or a crappy color or messed up texture on a small part of the hold. Nothing wrong like misalligned bolt holes or anything serious at all.,Nov 2007,Jun 7 2013,0

9595,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,1, Josh~ THANK YOU for the detailed and insightful review.   I have been using my own Miura 50 for several months.  It is the pack that I use day-in and day-out to get to the crag when I am guiding.  I second just about everything that you've already said.     The only thing that I want to specifically second is that this pack is fantastic for carrying big loads.  Occasionally~ I have to carry my own personal climbing gear plus up to three ropes~ 100 feet of anchor cord and a full trad rack.  Loaded down with all of this gear~ the pack weighs over 60 pounds~ easily.  First of all~ the pack has the ability to swallow all of this stuff (with the ability to strap 2 ropes to the outside~ when needed)~ and it carries it all in reasonable comfort.  I certainly wouldn't recommend carrying this much stuff to anyone~ but know that the pack can handle even the heaviest loads.   My only gripe is with the internal gear loops.  I love using internal gear loops to organize my stuff.  The only problem with the Miura's loops is that they are arranged vertically and they are large.  The effect is that nothing actually hangs from the loops.  Things attached to the loops simply sit in the bottom of the pack.  I would have really appreciated horizontal gear loops located at the very top on the inside of the pack.   I had real separation anxiety when Osprey discontinued the last pack that I used from day to day.  The Miura 50 has not only filled the void~ but it has raised the bar.,Feb 2006,Oct 10 2008,0
9596,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,2, Thanks guys~ I totally love my pack as well. I’ve been using it for about 3 months. I got the 50L regular Black. In hindsight I probably would have loved the Raisin or the Lime colored version. This is a great pack~ the best I’ve ever had. I have yet to use the Pali rope bag because I prefer to strap it to the top. Because of the size of this bag I tend to make use of every inch of space~ which makes this a bit cumbersome. I normally stuff a full rack(C4 doubles~ TCU singles~ 15 Inferno QD’s~ slings~ 2 cordelettes)~ harnerss~ approach shoes~ helmet~ food~ down jacket~ guidebook and extras with a tad bit of room to spare. If I load it to the gills it’s pretty dang heavy~ I almost wish I also had the 30L version for sport cragging since I love the features.,Jan 2008,Oct 13 2008,0
9597,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,3, I've been using this pack for most of the current climbing season including a couple of trips to the desert~ cragging around Denver/Boulder~ etc.  It's about the best climbing pack I've ever owned (the horizontal gear loops suggested above would be a nice improvement however).  It swallows enormous amounts of gear easily~ opens up wide once at the crag for easy access~ carries huge loads comfortably and has a place for everything.  In short~ it's got everything you need and nothing you don't.  The local gear shop showed me a cool un-intended feature - it can be used just like a Crazy Creek chair.  Get out your Crazy Creek and your empty Miura~ look at both and think creatively - pretty cool.     The only other nit that could be picked is that it is a very beefy and heavy pack (empty).  For the use for which it's designed~ this is a reasonable trade-off however.  I don't normally expect to be doing 10 mile approaches with my cragging pack.,Mar 2002,Oct 13 2008,0
9598,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,4, Yep~ been using the 50 Tall Raisin for about 7 months and love it. A couple of things:   1) It is not a light pack. With lots of gear that is heavy~ this is no big deal~ but it is definitely a cragging pack.   2) I had to bend the sheet and stays near my lower back to get a good fit. I think I could have gone with the regular over the tall~ but the tall fit after I bent the sheet and stays.,Jul 2007,Oct 19 2008,0

Edit: Good write-up and thanks for it.    One question: is this a status buy? Or would a cheap but solid pack not get the job done on an approach like you found to the Needles~ or HCR~ or other places further afield? Or do you Miura 50 owners just really appreciate quality products? These are not argumentative or rhetorical questions - trying to understand the thinking on that kind of dough for a crag pack.",Nov 2003,Oct 20 2008,0

9602,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,8, Thanks for the responses. If it's a well-built product~ and lasts you three to four times what a cheaper model would~ then you end up with the best value AND you're consuming less materials than the guy who buys 3 or 4 packs in the same time frame.    So you owners just have to stick to your Miura's and not buy any more toys in this category for 15-20 years. I've had my El Shitterino pack for about 8 yrs now~ can't remember what the price was but less than $50 and it's still kicking~ still ugly~ still functional.    As long as form follows function and not vice-versa it's hard to go wrong in the consumerist role.,Nov 2003,Oct 21 2008,0
9603,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,9, Yep~ I've tried and sold a bunch of cragging packs over the years and this is by far the best I've found.  I foresee wearing this one out.  Just open the top~ dump all your stuff inside~ roll closed and go.  Simple and easy.  Once at the crag~ unzip the sides~ pull it open~ dig out what you want~ and climb.  Simple and easy.     If only Arcteryx would think-out a technical alpine pack as well as they did the Miura for its application:  Nozone - too heavy by half.  New Khamsin's - no sheet/stay in the 40L~ doofy and fiddly tool attachment system~ over-designed crampon pouch.,Mar 2002,Oct 21 2008,0
9604,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,10, Picked up the Miura 50 before heading to the Creek for Thanksgiving.  I'm still amazed at how much you can stuff into this thing - triple rack~ 70m rope~ 2 pairs of shoes~ harness~ the draw hanging flying squirrel~ etc.  It carries all this and more comfortably.  really liked the gear loops inside for keeping the rack organized and allowing you to pick and choose what you need.  Also the two compression straps can be removed easily for snagless hiking in brush filled areas.  Spot on Arcteryx......The pali is also awesome~ albeit a bit pricey.,Dec 2007,Dec 13 2008,0
9605,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,11, Just add my $0.02 to the raves for this thing. After my old Lowe Mtn Attack 50 disappeared from the base of a route~ I was in the market. A couple of friends ended up with the Miura 50 and after checking theirs out in action at the crags~ I found one for $160ish online. It's perfect for cragging. The only thing I might add would be a grab strap/handle running vertically on each side near the middle of the body. The lining on the back and shoulder straps looks prone to snagging and wear~ but it's the only thing remembling a fault I can come up with.   Being able to quickly get everything out by zipping it open~ and not wrestling an extension sleeve while packing~ no drawstrings to mess with~ etc is superb. No more floppy top lids or cursing while trying to wrestle a rope bag through a too tight top opening. The framesheet gives big support and keeps cam lobes from poking you in the back. I'd recommend this to anyone~ it's the best crag bag I've had by miles.,Nov 2006,Jan 26 2009,0

9610,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,16," I have owned the Miura 50 Tall (i.e.~ 55 Liters) now for almost six months using it probably around 15 times mostly local craging and a one day alpine trip. In summary it is a joy.   One pet gripe.  The roll top is great for multiple accesses made during a typical crag day~ but it does reduce capacity compared to a typical sleeve and draw string closure system.  With a rack~ rope~ shoes~ harness~ clothes~ and food container(s) all in the mix it is often a small struggle to get the roll top closed.  If you are carrying two ropes in the aforementioned scenario the second will have to go external.   Note~ there is a 3/8"" EV50 foam padding along the bottom and sides of the pack.  This is great for day to day use - drop the pack and you rack isn't destroyed on hard ground and vice versa for the pack fabric.  However~ for the weight weenie on an alpine excursion you can remove these pads internally.  Be warned they are a bear to extract and replace.",Nov 2002,Aug 1 2009,0
9611,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,17, I've had the 30 in lime for a couple years~ I use it often and have no real complaints.  I agree about the internal loops~ somewhat useless in their current position.  The bag can haul heavy loads comfortably and is functionally perfect for my needs.  I have a tendency to shred my toys~ so the beefy Arc'teryx quality makes this worth the price.,Feb 2010,Feb 16 2010,0

9614,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,1,20, Nice review~ thanks glad someone has found a near perfect pack for climbing.   I have collected a grip of packs over the years most of em are long gone having been sold off due to my never ending quest for the perfect pack there always seems to be one or two things about one pack or another that piss me off enough to burn or sell the damn thing   after a couple of trips / seasons.     That being said.......    I want the Swiss army knife of packs  who makes one Ill gladly pay   twice the price of this pack if I can find one and here's my point    If you want a Wall Mart pack that might last a trip or two than buy it   wall mart will love your repeat business    Or If you can realize that the price of a well made pack spread over several years of use really amounts to less than you'll spend on Starbucks over the same number of years the pack is in use.   This is how I justify All my purchases no matter if it's a pack or a cam or any gear    No I don't own this Miura 50 pack or any Arc'Teryx pack for that matter they are way too heavy empty in my book to even consider.   This pack alone weighs a couple ounces shy of 5 fricken pounds!   Half of that to me amounts to extra water/gear/???? But that's just me .

9617,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,2,2," I have the Miura 20.  I love the pack~ the removable straps are great~ you can use them where you need them.  The ""drawbridge"" design is really nice for getting at gear with out having to tug it out.  It's not a super light pack but I like the beefiness~ it's a tuff pack with tuff zippers.  I love the top handle for when I carry it off my back.  I get a lot of compliments on the bright green color.   My only complaints are:    1) the zipper handle for the zipper that connects the main compartment to the vertical~ outer compartment~ only faces inward.   2) the 2 permanent gear loops on the outside of the pack could be a little longer for ice-axe storage.   To end on a positive note~ this pack has also been great for school.",Jan 2007,Sep 14 2010,0

I haven't tried to stuff a Metolius rope bag in the bottom~ I just went for the Miura/Pali combo. It's kinda tight with stuffing a 70 m~ but I wouldn't go any other way-the Pali is shaped perfectly to fit in the bottom of the pack!

9630,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,2,15, squiddo...I was gonna add about sizing but I had momentarily forgot my torso length. I'm pretty sure I'm a 20.5 and the tall actually feels a tad too...tall! I was surprised as every other pack I've always been the biggest size~ and even then some don't quite fit. But Arcteryx is one of the few companies that offer a true tall pack.    Of note I have an Arcteryx Axios 50 in Tall and it fits great. The Muira is unique b/c they offer three sizes~ vs. two for the Axios. Their website showed a great sizing chart (couldn't find it again) that showed the overlap of the Muira's sizing. I think at 20.5 I am right on the cusp of Reg or Tall.    Yeah~ my local shop doesn't carry it either. We have an REI somewhat close by and I used my dividend plus 20% off and got this mail ordered to me. I figured I'd return it to the store if needed. I'm gonna need to try the Reg size~ though~ so its back to the drawing board. Luckily~ another 20% off coupon just showed up in the mail:),Jun 2010,May 17 2011,0

9654,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,3,19, The 50 is stiff~ wide~ heavy~ and has a huge waist belt.  It is great for cragging when you just want to throw gear in and go.  Moving between routes is quick and easy~ even with a ton of gear.  The stiffness and volume mean you don't have to pack it well.  Great for Indian Creek.   Once the approach is long enough that I think about what I am carrying~ I switch to a smaller~ lighter weight pack.  Ditto for approaching a long multi pitch route.  The 30 would probably be a better size in those cases~ but I think there are lighter~ more versatile (and cheaper~ bonus) packs in that size range.  The easy access drawbridge opening doesn't offer much value if you only pack and unpack it once at the base of the route.,Nov 2007,Jul 13 2012,0
9655,Gear Review: ARC'TERYX Miura 50 Climbing Pack,4,0, I should also mention that with the zipper fold-down style~ when your bag gets pulled to be opened up by TSA with all your cams and crap inside~ it's a whole lot easier to open it up for them and then re-close it than with a top-loader.

9662,Looking for a New Rope,1,0, Hey~   I have been using an Edelweiss Element 10.2 mm rope for a while.  I'm looking to buy a new rope this off-season and would like some input.   Traits I would like include:   -dynamic   -70 m   -dry treated   -9.8-10.1 mm   -middle mark or bi-pattern   I'd like a lightweight rope that can handle some abuse while staying workable.  If you have a rope that meets some or all of these conditions~ please let me know your feelings about it.,Nov 2009,Nov 29 2010,0
9663,Looking for a New Rope,1,1, I love my New England Glider (9.9) 70m.  I also see them on sale here and there.  Holds up well and has awesome hand to it.  Nice colors and you have the option of bi-pattern (i wet cheap and did not get this option).,Oct 2010,Dec 1 2010,0
9664,Looking for a New Rope,1,2, I would also recommend New England ropes.  I did half dome last summer and we took my brand new Edelrid and my buddy's year old New England rope.  We used the ropes interchangeably so each went through pretty much the same wear and tear.  By the time we topped out~ my rope looked fairly thrashed (though no internal damage) and my friend's New England rope still looked like new.  Their sheath technology is impressive and next time I buy a rope it will be New England.,Jul 2009,Dec 1 2010,0
9665,Looking for a New Rope,1,3, ive had an element for a while and think its a great rope~ just a little to fat. i recently bought a bluewater lightning 9.7 and am very pleased with it. seems a bit burlier than other 9.7s but much easier to handle than the element. no middle mark on mine and im not sure if you can get a bi-pattern but ive climbed on a lot of different ropes and this one is by far my favorite.,Sep 2009,Dec 1 2010,0
9666,Looking for a New Rope,1,4," New England does make great ropes. Beal has a solid performer too in that range~ so does Edelweiss~ Edelrid and a few others. Not Cousin. Not Petzl. In fact~ Do NOT buy the Petzl ropes. They had a batch of some that literally fell apart within a couple of weeks~ then they didn't stand behind them and told the sellers to piss up a rope. (presumably another brand). You can search on Rockclimbing for all that trauma. Do a search for ""Shit ropes""~ ""new ropes that fall apart"" or ""Petzl ropes"". Same-same.    Although I swore I wouldn't EVER buy a Petzl rope~ my inner gear whore went nutz when REI put the 9.4 x 70 Petzl on sale for $88 dollars. Holy shit that's dirt cheap for a 9.4 x 70m. My sweet but older @3 years) 9.4 70m Bluewater Dominator was aging and I figured I'd buy the new one and open her up next year or the year after...such a sick price. Yet a buddy brought his Petzl 9.4 x 70 down to Red Rocks last month~ and despite being relatively new~ it was a total POS. Total P.O.S.  First~ despite being relatively new~ his has stiffened: much like a steel cable. Certainly much much more than my old 9.4. Not a good trait. But worse than that~ much worse and perhaps even life threatening in this case was the fact that it kinked badly. By badly let me say that in 38 years of climbing I've never seen one kink that bad. We were on some long easy route...Birdland~ and it looked like it carried a twist as I flaked it out on the goround~ so I showed my friend how to clip it to your harness with a tail so when the leader hit the first belay you could roll it around and untwist it before you tied in~ even if the leader couldn't hear you. Neat trick but simple~ basically don't tie in but just clip the end to your harness gear loop with 5 feet of slack so the leader doesn't pull it all the way up as they set up the belay). Yet that wasn't enough and it still kinked anyway on the route. I explained to my buddy that you need to unroll ropes when new or they will kink and I was told that not only had he down that but that full length raps didn't seem to help make it unkink like most other ropes he'd encountered.    We rapped the 7 raps to the round~ which normally would fix any kink issues for some time. The next day they carried that rope up Epinephrine (without the old guy)~ and lo and behold I was told that it kinked up so badly mid route~ despite the fact that they were only normally swapping leads: that they had to untie and unkink it. That would have been fine but the fucker got stuck on a flake below and it was an extra 1/2 hour.    Trust me~ if you blow a half hour on a route like epi~ at 1900' or whatever the hell it is~ you might be sleeping on the cactus in 20 degree weather because of it. It's bad....real real bad. That those guys were on top by 1:07pm (by my watch as I'd hiked up with shoes and water)  in no part mitigates the Petzls piss poor performance.    In fact I'm selling that POS. I paid $88.93. It's for sale for $150 right now.   Anyone?...              ?   Anyone           ? Hmmm~ poor sales skillz. I need to put it on ebay.",Mar 2006,Dec 6 2010,0
9667,Looking for a New Rope,1,5," I love the Bluewater Lightning Pro 9.7. Very durable~ stretchy and soft catching (but not ridiculous like the Petzl). Nice feel- not ""cable-y""~ slides through a Gri Gri easily when feeding slack fast and yet locks it up quickly as well. It comes in a bi-color also.   I'm not so keen Petzl ropes. I wouldn't recommend one or buy one.",Feb 2008,Dec 6 2010,0
9668,Looking for a New Rope,1,6, Sterling ropes all the way. I have a 10.2x60m Evolution Kosmos that I love. It's tough and it's lasted through some hard climbing and big falls~ no issues at all and it handles great.  I also have Sterling Marathon 8.8mm doubles and they are really great.  Double ropes are the way to go. Sterling is a bit cheaper than other companies too.,Apr 2010,Dec 6 2010,0
9669,Looking for a New Rope,1,7," I second on how bad the Petzl ropes are. They kink and do all the things a rope shouldn't in climbing.   Anyway~ I love Millet ropes. They last really long. I guess it is because they make their ropes with ""3"" cores (triaxiale). Specifically I use the Diamax 10.2 mm for my single dynamic. I think all of Millet ropes are dry treated unless you are looking at their ""eco"" ropes. I don't see durability as one of the traits you are looking for~ but if you do decide to make it a factor~ then check out the Millet ropes.",Nov 2008,Dec 30 2010,0
9670,Looking for a New Rope,1,8, Sterling makes a light 9.7 (cant remember the name).  I climbed on it for a year (I live outside boulder and climbed on it every week~ year round) before using it for a haul line on El Cap and another wall. Then continued to burn it out at Rifle later that year. This was an incredibly long lasting rope~ I can't even begin to recount the amount of times I've taken bigs falls on it. I'm gonna buy another one soon.   Bought a Beal rope once and it blew apart from day 1.   Mammut makes fantastic cords as well.,Jul 2007,Feb 1 2011,0
9671,Looking for a New Rope,1,9, imho~ the single best rope on the market today for all around use is the Sterling Evolution Velocity- 9.8mm line. I've owned them as my primary line for years and its always my go to rope- its beefy enough to take a beating~ but skinny enough to not be a bear to lug around. It's got a solid set of specs- impact force~ falls~ etc~ etc- there are ropes out there that give softer falls~ but arent as durable. there are ropes out there that are more durable~ but dont handle as well or give as soft a catch...the Velocity does everything pretty damn good to excellent~ depending on what you're doing. one thing~ though- the 70m flavor of the Velocity is Heavy~ imho- i'd go for something skinnier at that length- 9.4 or 9.6 at the most.   a few other thoughts-   Petzl ropes arent all that bad~ and they're seeing a redesign in construction this year. the failure of the Zephyr (a now-discontinued line) was most likely a thread problem~ not a manufacturing problem. still an issue that Petzl could have handled better~ though.   New England/Maxim ropes- great hand~ solid construction~ and highest impact forces on the market. Something to keep in mind.   Edelrid- not much experience with them~ but i've heard good things.   Edelweiss- would never buy another rope from them again. My only Edelweiss lasted three months. most of my ropes last two years.   Bluewater- solid construction~ good specs~ decent handling- i'd buy a bluewater if the price was right.   Mammut- burly~ good hand~ another rope i'd buy if the price was right.,unknown,Feb 1 2011,0

9673,Looking for a New Rope,1,11, I love my sterling marathon 10.2  This was season number 2 and it has held up exceptionally well.  A friend recommended the marathon to the evolution velocity for its durability~ but I have heard great things about the evolution velocity 9.8~ available with all those traits you were looking for (bi color / 70 meter etc..),Aug 2009,Feb 1 2011,0
9674,Looking for a New Rope,1,12, Mammut tusk 9.8 is a wonderful rope~ one of the best I've ever climbed on. The Beal in the same diameter range is great to with a bit more stretch. For sport go with the tusk....... trad go Beal or perhaps the Blue water's lightning pro,Aug 2009,Feb 1 2011,0

9677,Looking for a New Rope,1,15, I really like Edelrid ropes~ and I am quite happy with them. I have been using one for just over two years for sport climbing and it's still going good.   My Petzl Fuse on the other hand is a different story. I never had the kink problems mentioned above. However~ I wasn't too impressed with the durability on the rope. In fact~ it just got core shot last weekend. I have been using it as my multi-pitch rope for just over a year~ so I guess I got good life out of it since I too bought it when REI had it on sale. In that year I used it~ it looked more beat up than my Edelrid which gets a lot more use.   To replace it~ I ordered the 9.4 Sterling Ion 2 because I got a killer deal on one. I climbed on one once~ and I liked it... But mainly because I got a great price on it.   But for the most part~ I am very partial to Edelrid.,Jan 2009,Feb 1 2011,0
9678,Looking for a New Rope,1,16, +1 for not getting Petzl ropes. My half line shredded after 8 uses. Every time we rappeled the sheath would flake off until it core shot about 5 feet of rope. Petzl would not stand by the rope. My Petzl rope is now used for cord.    Now I use PMI Verglas half lines~ which hold up and handle very well. I am not sure about PMI single lines~ but I really love both my PMI half line and static line.,Jan 2011,Feb 1 2011,0
9679,Looking for a New Rope,1,17,,Dec 2009,Feb 1 2011,0
9680,Looking for a New Rope,1,18, Here's another vote for the Sterling velocity in that diameter (9.8). Best all purpose rope I've owned in 15 years. Plus Sharma works 5.15b/c with it~ it's gotta be the rope~ right?   I also like the Petzl Fuse 9.4~ like a few people here and unlike several others. We've owned 2 of them~ done tons of long free routes with em~ jugged em on grade V's~ etc. I find the stiffer than usual feel to be an asset~ not a problem. But that rope is skinnier than what you're looking for~ and I haven't owned the 9. or whatever they make~ I think it's called the nomad.   Beal ropes suck ass~ don't buy one unless you want to throw it away in June.,Jan 2008,Feb 1 2011,0

9683,Looking for a New Rope,2,0, I own an Edelrid Eagle 9.8 and I love the rope~ I actually just bought another dry 50m Edelrid 10.3mm on Sierra for $87 as I like having a shorter rope around and even with it being a 10.3 it'll still save me a little weight by being 10m shorter.     Edelrid doesn't have a huge following in the US but I am super happy with the rope.  I also bought 4 Edelrid harnesses while I was at it so we'll see how I like those.,Jul 2008,Mar 11 2013,0
9684,Looking for a New Rope,2,1, I like the Mammut line up so much that is all I will even consider buying now. Prices are good~ I like their durability and handling characteristics~ and reputation as well. I have had nothing but good luck with all of their ropes and mine seem to wear like iron~ handle well~ tie knots easily~ untie when desired easily~ etc.,Jul 2011,Apr 13 2013,0
9685,Looking for a New Rope,2,2, I love my 60m 10.3mm Eldrid Cobra. Takes tons of abuse and looks brand new. It's silky smooth too~ though that's a bit of a downside as it can slip a bit in a grigri. The only major downside is its heavy as balls. Very easy to untangle~ never kinks. Awesome awesome awesome.   Edit: I met the international sales representative for Sterling once. He had the best job in the world I swear to buddah.,Dec 2012,Jun 2 2013,0

9690,BD X4s - First Pics,1,0," No rock time on these yet so impressions of them are purely ""held them in my kitchen"" nature.   Nice~ build quality.  Really like the sculpted trigger.  VERY MUCH like a Basic/Alien cam in size~ feel etc.  The ""symmetric swage"" seems ""meh"" - not all that noticeable.  The cable ""armor"" is pretty slick - could be best in class.  Not ground breaking but if you don't have small 4CU I'd look at these and the new Alien/Totem Basic.

9691,BD X4s - First Pics,1,1," Yeah the cable protector is pretty cool. It will add durability~ but when cams last 10-20 years anyway it doesn't really make much difference.

9694,BD X4s - First Pics,1,4," Durability in Free Climbing use might be a wash but aid climbing tends to trash the stem/trigger areas of cams much faster.  There I could certainly see the armored cable setup being more durable.  Of course the X4 might not be as ""clutch"" as the softer cam Basic/Alien is and Totem Cams are certainly wiggling into the ""clutch piece"" space as well.   Not sure why but BD didn't give the X4 cams a tumble finish which left the cam faces with ""Sharp"" edges.  I can see them mushrooming and having the same issues as the Aliens due with their rough cut cam lobes.  Totem addressed this in their ""Basic Cam"" version.",Jun 2006,May 27 2013,0

9709,Bleaggles vs belay specs-- any recomendations?,1,0, I just saw somebody using those Kraut belay specs-- CUs?-- and was then told that there are cheaper versions~ the Belaggles and Belay Specs.   I am wondering if ppl could recommend one or the other for smebody who has to wear glasses.   I typically wear either sunglasses or my regular specs when climbing~ and so I am wondering~ which would work better over a pair of glasses? Chris,Jun 2010,Apr 3 2013,0
9710,Bleaggles vs belay specs-- any recomendations?,1,1, Belay Specs work well over most glasses. I wear them with chunky~ square framed sunglasses and more sporty wrap around sunglasses regularly. Lots of our customers wear them with glasses as well. I haven't used or handled Belaggles but the amount of material around the nose might make it hard to fit another pair of glasses under there. Belay Specs has a 30 day money back guarantee so if they don't work with your glasses~ you can return them for a full refund.,Oct 2012,Apr 6 2013,0
9711,Bleaggles vs belay specs-- any recomendations?,1,2, Can't comment on the Belay Specs~ but I have the CUs (which are almost identical) and this weekend played around quite a bit with the belaggles. I don't think you can go wrong with either.    There are definitely some advantages with regard to the Belaggles over the CU style~ but most notably I'd say being able to put them on one handed is a plus. It's hard to describe~ but the CUs are very springy and require both hands to put on. Obviously~ the Belaggles and belay specs are comparably priced. The belaggles are a bit heavier than the CUs but definitely more robust. Speaking with the guys at Belaggles they have some new models and features that sound pretty awesome so definitely reach out to them for more info.,Mar 2012,Apr 7 2013,0

9713,Bleaggles vs belay specs-- any recomendations?,1,4, I have used all three versions of the belay glasses~ CU's~ Belay Specs and the new Belaggales. Of the three~ the Belay Specs stand out a bit from the rest. Nothing earth shattering~ but they are just the most comfortable (and best bang for the $).     While I think the Belaggles look cool~ they are definitely not one size fits all. I have what I would consider to be a normal sized cranium and found that they press on my temples which is not that comfortable (they give me headaches after a bit). For women or people with tiny heads they may be fine.   Belay Specs have larger prisms than the CU's and are comfy for any size head~ vs. Belaggles. They are the ones I ended up going for.    The owner of Belay Spec's seems really cool as well. Definitely proud of the product he makes.   Thats my 2c at least.,Jan 2013,Apr 8 2013,0

9715,Bleaggles vs belay specs-- any recomendations?,1,6, Cool to see everyone looking at the options in the belay glasses market!   Belaggles aim to offer a wider field of view~ comfort~ safety~ and a unique design element. Size wise~ Belaggles fit a range of head sizes. The material can be a bit stiff fresh out the mold but loosens up nicely as you wear them more. They also do fit well with most prescription glasses and sunglasses. We were out demoing at Red Rocks and had lots of belayers wearing them with sunglasses under the bright Vegas sun.   A great feature Belaggles also offer is the minimal lens impact points. If they drop onto flat or semi flat rocky surfaces~ the lenses are protected and won't chip.   Also~ the ability to put them on with one hand while holding the brake rope is key.   We do offer a 30 day satisfaction guarantee where you can return them for a full refund.   Any other questions~ feel free to drop us a line at info@belaggles.com.

9716,Bleaggles vs belay specs-- any recomendations?,1,7, John~ quick question for you: the site mentions numerous times that there's a patent pending on the Belaggles.

I would have been open to buying the Belaggles too~ but at the time it was between either the CUs or the Belay Specs and the latter were much cheaper.,May 2010,Apr 10 2013,0

As a result they are less top heavy and less likely to come off your nose should you need to move your head quickly for whatever reason.    It is a very minor difference and in my opinion probably not worth the extra price on the tag. But that's something to decide for yourself.,May 2011,May 13 2013,0

9730,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,2, Not really new. Made by DMM and $$$~ I believe.

9732,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,4," I've started carrying one on my harness to have my ""rescue kit"" on. I have not had to use it in a real-life rescue scenario yet but have played around with it a bit. It seems that it does greatly ease the ability to haul by reducing friction and is an interesting idea. My big gripe is that it is so small on one side and shaped bulkily on the other. That makes it hard to put several things on it and be able to handle it easily. I only carry 2 short prussik slings~ a tiny knife and a tibloc and it barely fits and even when it's just right~ then the gate doesn't open all the way.    It'll be interesting to see if I continue to carry it. It would make my life much easier in a hauling scenario and that would make carrying it worth it~ but in all reality that kind of situation rarely happens. That said~ it does happen and I did find myself hauling an inexperienced partner through a crux section once and would have killed for one of these at the time. Bottom line though is that I would NEVER carry these to replace normal carabiners.",Feb 2010,Apr 13 2013,0

9734,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,6, I bought two of them years ago~ don't really know why.

9738,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,10," Although I don't own any~ I have used them when a climbing partner had one or two.  They are actually quite useful~ in certain situations.  They are a specialized piece~ and no one would (or~ at least~ should) buy an entire rack's worth of them.  Having one or two~ to use in the right situations~ might be worthwhile.  No one ""needs"" them~ of course~ but they are just another trick up one's sleeve.   A great application is for the sharp bend created in the rope for the piece at the beginning of a big roof.  Extending the piece helps only so much if the roof is large; the revolver helps a lot here.  If I were a Gunks climber~ and thus climbed a lot of roofs~ I would definitely keep one or two revolver biners on the rack for this use.",Jun 2008,Apr 13 2013,0

9740,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,12, I'd bank on it that the majority of people that own them DON'T need or probably even use them as intended.

9741,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,13, I have 2 of the wiregate version and 2 of the locking.   I have used the wiregate ones on traversing routes and found them useful.   The locking ones I use as my toprope setup~ but they require a third biner in the middle to separate them.  Otherwise~ the two wheels grind against each other.  This drastically decreases the amount of aluminum oxide on my rope.   Now cue someone getting all bent out of shape about how they're not supposed to be used for toproping.  To which I reply: the worst that will happen is someone gets lowered too fast (yet to happen in my case)~ and the bearing/axle assembly overheats~ melts~ and siezes the mechanism.  Now you just have a very expensive non-rotating wheel biner.,Aug 2007,Apr 13 2013,0

9746,Carabiner with a 'Roller Device' on them,1,18, I have two of them and use them in various ways on trad routes and sport routes~ especially when the route changes directions.  They work great for reducing rope drag on long pitches.     I would caution against using them at the top anchor as they reduce the friction too much.  I have personal experience with that.

9766,La Sportiva Muira VS,1,3, You’ve worn a hole through your first pair of climbing shoes because it turns out that you really like climbing (you might even be a little addicted to it). You’re ready for a new pair of shoes and are looking for a high performance shoe~ convinced that it is most definitely the shoe that stands between you sending or not sending your project. When it comes to women’s high performance shoes~ I count a total of 7 options available in the US. I’m not sure whether Missy~ Mary~ and I all just copied each other~ or La Sportiva’s Miura VS is simply the best high performance shoe~ but as we all own a pair of these~ Crux Crush is giving you not one but three reviews of the Miura VS. Fit Cate: Fits compactly~ perfectly stiff in the toe for edging~ but with a little too much extra room in the heel and sides. Ideally I’d like to take these a size smaller as I like a tight but not painful shoe~ but the toe box is too stiff for me to comfortably climb in anything smaller than a 38.   Mary: For me~ the fit is good~ like 4 out of 5 stars good. The rubber doesn’t suction to my foot the way the La Sportiva Testarossa does (see review here)~ so you don’t get that “fits like a glove” feeling~ but it still hits my foot in the right places. For it’s aggressiveness this shoe is really comfortable. As for sizing~ any smaller and I’d be in a little pain.   Missy:  I switched from my comfy Evolv Elektras to the Miura because I was looking for more of an aggressive shoe~ but was worried about sacrificing comfort for performance. Fortunately~ this has not been the case at all.  They broke in quickly but did not stretch out. I’ve had mine for about a year~ already got them resoled once~ and they are still my main climbing shoe.   Form   Cate: I like the shape of the shoe – makes my foot feel nice and petite! The Velcro abilities are clutch for on and off while bouldering. However~ I could go without the flower-power pattern~ adding a splash of color instead.   Mary: I’m not crazy about the aesthetics of this shoe~ but I overlook that for its other qualities. I agree with Cate here and would be psyched to see this shoe lose the flowers for a fun color pop.   Missy:  I’m a big Velcro fan~ especially the three straps~ because it allows for a nice custom fit~ and I like the colors~ black~ white~ with a little yellow.  What I don’t love are the little flowers. BUT having said that~ since I love these shoes so much~ it’s like I don’t even see the flowers anymore.  I guess love is blind after all.   Function   Cate: These are my go-to shoes for any technical climbing involving edging or non-existent feet. However~ if I’m climbing over-hung routes or anything involving heel-hooks~ I’d wear my Solutions.   Mary: This shoe was designed to be a well-rounded performance shoe~ so it’s good for most types of climbing. I think it’s decent for toeing-in on overhanging routes and secure enough for good heel hooking~ but it really shines as an edging shoe. However~ I would love the sole to be a touch thinner for more sensitivity.   Missy:  What I really like about this shoe is that I can trust it on the tiniest chips.  I think because of the softness it gives you sensitivity~ which provides you with control and precision~ and because of that you feel more confident.   Finances   Cate: Personally~ $170 seems a bit steep~ but I’m also quite frugal. I wouldn’t make these your gym shoes~ but they’re worth the money (and will hold up) to save for projecting routes outside.   Mary: I’ve owned two pairs so far and I will likely buy them again. They’ve become my outdoor warm-up shoes and go-to gym shoes (even though Cate wouldn’t use them this way). If you have the time to be patient~ you won’t have to pay full price for these babies. Check out the outdoor gear aggregator spadout.com to compare prices.   Missy: I found mine for $140~ and since this was my first pair of “serious” sport shoes I was a little freaked about plunking that down~ but I quickly got over it~ and have never once regretted it.  I would gladly pay that much again (and likely I will once I’ve run these into the ground).   Crush Status   Cate: Crushing on~ but not in love.   Mary: Long-term love. A pair you can count on.   Missy:  Beyond crushed out~ totally in love.,Dec 2010,May 6 2013,0

9769,Scarpa Force X,1,0, So I pulled my Force x's out of the box yesterday...literally 30 minutes before heading out to the local crag~ shoved my feet in them~ cinched them up and climbed!   First impressions are these:    This is an extremely well built shoe. Totally lined throughout..including the heel cup. A generously padded tongue keeps the top of the foot protected and comfortable~ velcro (hook and loop) system (opposing straps) is easy on easy off. I am not a fan of the xs edge rubber~ but even on the steep slab that I tested them on yesterday~ they seemed to hold quite well on small depressions~ nubbins and thin cracks. They smeared quite a bit better than I expected...a happy bonus for sure. They also held an edge quite nicely~ again...much better than anticipated. I got these shoes for all day guiding and long routes..I needed something comfortable but not so big and sloppy that they were useless to climb in. I have found that these shoes do a nice job bridging the gap and are extremely comfortable right out of the box. I did size these shoes up considerably from my Instincts. The instincts are a 44.5 and I went up a full size to a 45.5 and am psyched. I probably could have gotten away with a 45~ but at close to 50 years old...why? lol. My dogs have suffered enough...(think 80's). Toe rand is good and has nice coverage. These are not a real technical shoe by any stretch and probably not a great choice for steep overhanging sport or bouldering~ and they were a bit painful in the cracks (more like a slipper or even an Anasazi/Galileo). Despite the flat last and stiffer rubber the forefoot was pinched in the fist to hand jamb wide cracks.    So...first impressions are very good. I put 6 pitches under these puppies..starting at 5.8+ to 5.10 and never once reached for the velcro tabs or ibuprofin!! These would be a great beginner to intermediate shoe~ but you guys in the higher number range may want to consider this shoe for those moderate all day outings and long routes (I am thinking Winds~ etc...).

If you could~ please describe how you're using the rope~ i.e. multi-pitch~ single-pitch~ top rope~ and how long you've been using it.

9783,AlpineUp / ClickUp Belay Devices,1,0," With all the recent chat on assisted belay devises I thought this was topical.  I'm currently testing both AlpineUp and Click Up. So far I like them both. Far better than my experience with other ""assisted locking"" devices like the Mammut Smart. (The Edelrid Micro/Mega Jul also works on the same principle but has the same issues as a smart - didn't like)  I'll update this post as I get more time with them.   Quick Initial Observations for the Devices:   Both: The BIG selling point for these devices over the other assisted braking devices is HOW the lockup of the device occurs. In all the other devices (Smart~ Alpine Smart~ Micro/Mega Jul etc) the biner/rope freely slide into the lockup position. What I've found is that in normal belaying~ when I go to throw out slack the devices tend to lock up on their own and cause short roping etc. I typically have to hold the device (Smart) in the ""open"" position with my brake hand and feed the slack by pulling rope through with my free hand. This is less than ideal in my opinion. I've always ""pushed"" rope into my ATC etc with the brake hand while simultaneously pulling with the free hand.    With the Click/AlpineUP it's a bit different. Both devices have a spring-loaded ""paddle"" that holds the biner in the non-locking portion of the slot when forces on the device are low (feeding~ taking in rope). Only when there's a more forceful load on the device does it ""click"" over to the locking position. It's pretty slick and much easier to understand when you see it (see video clips below). ONE KEY NOTE: Both Devices REQUIRE your brake hand to hold the rope for it to lock up (you do that all the time anyway right?) If the rope is not held lockup is unlikely. This is different than a GriGri which most consider pretty ""hands free"" (even though you really shouldn't). The best way to think of the ""Ups"" is a halfway point between a fully manual ATC and the nearly automatic GriGri. It feeds more like and ATC but~ WITH A BRAKE HAND~ will lock up ala the GriGri.   One Note: The directions mention that BOTH devices need to be used with an HMS Style carabiner with 12mm round bar stock.  Climbing Technology sells one of their own (included with the alpine up) or you can buy one.  I think they recommend the HMS round bar style for consistency with the belay slot lock up.  Carabiners like the Gridlock of Petzl Attache 3d will likely not work well with the ""Ups"" - I haven't tested this personally however - I used their included HMS for my testing.   ClickUP: This is a sport climbing device for single rope use ala the GriGri. I agree with other users that it takes more force to feed rope than a simple ATC XP/Guide. Probably more like a GriGri2. It will feed best with sub 10mm ropes but is workable with a 10.2mm. I wouldn't go with anything larger. As stated above~ it's a nice halfway device between the GriGri and ATC. I usually prefer to use an ATC XP/Guide for most belaying. I've had a GriGri since '92 but it always seemed like more work to ""throw"" rope out when the leader was clipping. That and with the GriGri and GG2 I STILL hold down the cam with my thumb when pulling slack. I just can't find a good way to give a clean and smooth belay without holding the cam. With the ClickUp I find I can give my more consistent ""ATC Belay"" while also having the added benefit of lockup when needed.    AlpineUp: This one is a bit more complicated and heavy than its single rope brother. It's similar in weight/bulk to a GriGri so certainly different than my ATC Guide. It's obviously designed more for half rope use. The slots are more narrow so bulky single ropes are a bit harder to work with. 8.5mm are probably IDEAL. I need more time with it though. The AlpineUp is GREAT for the half rope belay since it doesn't lock up right away. This makes feeding slack on one rope while taking it in on the other (common with half rope technique) GREAT. The AlpineUp also offers a ""Guide Mode"" for belaying 2nds and an optional ""dynamic belay"" setup that functions like a normal tube (no lockup). This will provide the more dynamic catch (rope slips through) you want on that sketchy #3 IMP.    There's not a lot of info out there on how soft the catch is with these assisted locking belay devices but I'd put them closer to a hard GriGri catch than the softer ATC catch. There's not much rope slip going on when they lock. Belay theory on dynamic catches with gloves etc is a whole other discussion of course...   So far though~ I like them!youtube.com/watch?v=_qO41Rx…youtube.com/watch?v=EogWFgH…",Jun 2006,Apr 13 2013,0

9785,AlpineUp / ClickUp Belay Devices,1,2, Of course~ no device can guarantee locking if it isn't attended.  I've used gri-gris~ the Alpine Smart~ and the Alpine Up~ and my sense is that the Alpine Up is as likely to hold an unattended fall as any of the others.  Partial confirmation is provided by the following video: youtube.com/watch?v=nFn4xzV…   Of course~ no manufacturer is going to say you can do this.,Feb 2008,Apr 13 2013,0
9786,AlpineUp / ClickUp Belay Devices,1,3, Could not tell in the jerky video~ can't clearly see the device. Question: Is the Alpine Up a double version of the single rope Click Up~ or a totally different device by some other company?

9790,AlpineUp / ClickUp Belay Devices,1,7, I'm just getting used to my Alpine Up~ and yes~ it chokes on even fluffy 10mm ropes.  It is lovely with doubles.   I have to use the modified mode for rappel because of my light weight~ but it is very smooth in that set-up and still locks up well when the lever is released.     Used it once to belay from above in Click-up mode~ attached to my belay loop~ redirected though the anchor~ with doubles and lots of rope out.  It kept locking up when I tried to take in rope~ so I had to tie off my second and switch to standard ATC mode.  Not sure if I could avoid unintended locking if I were to practice more with how I take in rope~ but would probably not try this again.  Will practice with a direct belay off the anchor mode if I need an autolocking set-up in the future.,Nov 2007,Apr 15 2013,0
9791,AlpineUp / ClickUp Belay Devices,1,8, My experience with the Alpine Up has been very different.  I haven't had any difficulty with it locking up in any belay configuration with single ropes of 9.8mm and 10mm and mostly double 8.5's. I've tried it in the gym with fatter worn ropes and in that situation it was a total pain in the ass.   One possible explanation for my lack of lock-up issues with appropriate rope sizes is that with the Up I belay palm-up~ which gives me much more ability to control half ropes independently~ but which also facilitates pumping slack to the leader with all rope types and~ as an additional benefit~ keeps the belay and brake strand more parallel in the heat of battle and so discourages (and in my case eliminates) unwanted locking.     Palm-up belaying with an ATC-type device leads to a braking position that is not as strong as the palm-down position~ but with assisted locking this doesn't matter at all since the device~ rather than the hand~ is doing the braking.   It is possible that most people will have to learn slightly different hand motions with assisted locking devices.  Most people I see lock off an ATC every time they take in slack~ and so have an ingrained reaction to drop the brake hand at the end of every take-in cycle.  You don't have to do this---and shouldn't do it---with an assisted locking device~ because then you'll have to unlock the device every cycle as well.,Feb 2008,Apr 15 2013,0

9793,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,1," Hmm.. I've been 'testing' my Beal Joker for a year or so.   Disadvantage: No bicolor option. I prefer bicolor ropes to that you don't have to find the middle to know what end you are on. I suspect that the sheath weave pattern change would not behave well on this rope. The black version has no middle mark at all.  And not much will mark it well.    Disadvantage: Lack of margin. The rope will cut though more easily than fatter ropes. It sure scuffs easily~ and I'll be quick to retire it.   Advantage: Weight. This is great for those 1 hour slog approaches in the Flatirons when your partner says ""I'll bring the rack~ you bring the rope.""   Advantage: Space- you can fit this and a rack into a ropebag.   Advantage: Belay- you can use the best-ever belay device with this thing~ the DMM Buggette.  It's like a 1 Oz. ATC for thin ropes.",Jan 2001,Jun 10 2007,0

9795,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,3, One other nice thing about double ropes: If you happen to fall while clipping a piece with an armload of slack above your head it's not nearly as big of a fall as it would be with a single rope.,Jan 2001,Jun 11 2007,0
9796,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,4, A 70m Mammut Infinity 9.5mm rope weighs just 12.3 oz more than a 70m Beal Joker (58g/m vs. 53g/m).   Advantages of the Infinity over the Joker: ,Jan 2001,Jun 11 2007,0
9797,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,5, The Mammut Infinity is a great rope and has some of the benefits that the Beal doesn't.    The thing that atracts me to the Beal Joker is the cost~ weight and versatility. Sure~ it's not going to be as durable as other ropes since it's a specialized rope only.   Right now the Joker is on sale at Wilderness Exchange.   Thanks to everyone for the feedback.,Jul 2002,Jun 12 2007,0
9798,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,6, In comparing Mammut Infinity to Beal Joker one should also mention that the Joker has the lower impact force (8.2 kN vs. 9.1 kN) and the Infinity is only certified as single rope.,Feb 2006,Jun 12 2007,0
9799,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,7, Having owned one Beal rope in the past~ I would never buy another.  The dynamic elongation of their single ropes~ all in the 37%-38% range~ is simply too much for my tastes.  I saw (and experienced) too many toprope falls where the climber fell 10 feet or more just due to rope stretch.   The discussion of Mike McGlynn's fatal groundfall~ in which rope stretch was a possible factor~ also leads me to prefer less stretchy ropes made by manufacturers other than Beal.,Jan 2001,Jun 13 2007,0
9800,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,8, I don't argue your preference for a somewhat stiffer rope~ but in fairness one should also mention that less elongation comes at the price of higher impact force.   Since the Joker is definitely not a top-roping rope~ the following is slightly off-topic~ but it may be interesting to note that 10 feet of stretch in top roping can be achieved by slowly weighing 150 feet of most Mammut dynamic single ropes.  (The Supersafe is the exception.  It takes 175 feet to achieve that elongation.)  This analysis is a bit too simplified because it ignores friction through the top anchor~ but~ on the other hand~ sudden weighing~ even with 0 fall factor~ will cause twice the stretch than slow weighing for an ideal spring.   Concerning that accident~ while I agree that the rope may have stretched almost 15 feet~ I don't think that a rope manufactured 8 years ago would have stretched 5 feet in the same conditions.,Feb 2006,Jun 13 2007,0

9802,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,1,10, My joker rope was originally a 70m and now is a 60m. After its first use on a two pitch route on sandstone it was frayed so much that it looked like a 3 month old rope. On its second use it held two 20 foot falls (less than factor one) on a granite route~ but got two coreshots near the knot. Granted that desert sandstone and granite will eat up ropes~ but not this quickly. I've used it two other times~ both of which involved alpine style climbing with a low chance of falling. It worked great for these situations but I would not recommend using this rope on any route that you could fall on.,Oct 2006,Jun 13 2007,0

9813,Gear Review - Beal Joker 9.1mm Rope,2,0, I had a Beal rope years ago and liked it - tho I admit I have not used one of their ropes lately.   I am sold on Mammut ropes. I prefer ropes being at least 10mm for the added durability and resistance to being cut more easily perhaps (maybe it's just a mental thing on my part)~ I got a 60m rope for a mere $139 with a rope bag/tarp (it's nothing super fancy but works)~ and my Mammut's have always handled well~ don't kink on me~ knot and untie easily and seem to wear very well. It's all I use now.   I tried 2 Sterling Sharma 9.8's I think and I hate their ropes. All those ropes did for me was constantly tangle~ kink no matter what I tried flaking them out. I even called Sterling about it - and was told this was a common complaint sometimes b/c of their method of factory coiling of the ropes. Well guys - why not switch to a diff method of coiling if you are aware it creates a problem?   I wasn't impressed and got rid of both of those ropes in a hurry. I spent more time unkinking those tangled messes~ hanging them off of crags to try and straighten out as the factory suggested~ etc. - to no avail. Now that's MY experience per se - I am sure perhaps others have not had any issues with their Sterlings - dunno.   But now all I buy are Mammut ropes.,Jul 2011,Apr 13 2013,0

9834,Omega Pacific Doval Carabiner,1,19, When these things came out~ over 10 years ago~ they were relatively cutting edge. Very light for the day~ wiregate~ unique geometry for a light weight biner. A good~ but not great~ biner in it's time   But that was then~ designs have moved on for the better.   Around the same time~ they (Omega) had some funky shaped lightweight wiregates called the JC. I still have some of these kicking around. They managed to make a very light biner (again~ for the time) with a big fat rope bearing radius~ by channelizing down the spine of the biner. Kinda scary looking honestly~ but again pretty much cutting edge for the day.,Nov 2006,Apr 9 2013,0
9835,Omega Pacific Doval Carabiner,1,20," I really think the doval was designed by a comittee who had heard in broad strokes the advantages of oval- and d-shaped carabiners and thought ""we can do that"" without ever bothering to ask what design choices actually led to the advantages. Instead~ you've got an ovalized exterior but the interior is still d-shaped~ so there's shifting. Then they make sure the nose isn't very prominent~ so its hard to tell which end is the hinge of the gate without looking at it. The only thing they got right was to give it a straight spine with a nice rounded exterior~ but then they made it out forged~ shaped stock so its still not as good for a carabiner brake.   The doval is literally everything that could go wrong in carabiner design that still results in a carabiner that passes UIAA certification.",Mar 2002,Apr 9 2013,0

9868,scarpa vapor v's,2,11, im happy with the vapor vs. they have great feel and stick to small stuff really well. ive only worn them in the gym so far. outside i mostly climb trad so i go with something more comfy. they are def not an all day shoe for me but if i was ever gonna try a steep sport climb outdoors i would put these on over tc pros and mythos for sure.  mythos 44.5 tcpro 45.5 vapor v 46. the toe box does get more comfortable after a few days wearing them as someone else mentioned.,Apr 2012,Apr 7 2013,0

9870,scarpa vapor v's,2,13, My feet measure 9.5 US~ are of the wide forefoot/narrow heel variety and I like the vapor V's in 42 EU.  For reference~ I wear Sportiva katana velcro in 40.5 EU~ Scarpa Force in 41.5 (which is actually longer than the size 42 vapor V by a few mm !)~ Scarpa Techno in 42 (comfort fit)~ Sportiva TC's in 41.   I've worn mine on multipitch routes~ and like the sensitivity and sticky vibram XS Grip 2 rubber.  The newer ones look to have XS Edge.  Resoled with XS Edge they would be great gym shoes (I also have a pair of vapor S in 41.5 for bouldering/gym).,Jun 2006,Apr 7 2013,0

9872,scarpa vapor v's,2,15, Vapor V's are great~ but Boostics are even better.  I wear a 44 street shoe and am happy with 43.5 in the Vapor and 44 in Boostics.  The boostics are much better for steeper pitches and precise footwork in my opinion.,Jun 2007,Apr 8 2013,0
9873,scarpa vapor v's,2,16, For me~ typically~ Scarpa fits one size larger than Sportivas: so if I wear a 45 in a miura or Katana lace then a 46 will be about right with the Scarpa Vapor. One problem is consistency with Scarpa shoes~ I and others I know have bought the same size in the same shoe and had radically different fits. SOOO try them on before buying if you can~ otherwise try to order two pair of the size you want~ and one half size larger and smaller to see which pair fits perfectly~ then send the rest back!   I cried and whined to get Scarpa NA to bring the Vapor V's in a 46 to the US market~ which they finally did. I bought a pair as soon as I could~ and they fit about the same as my 45's~ which really bummed me out~ too tight for sport!,Oct 2006,Apr 8 2013,0

9885,Moon Climbing Fingerboard Review,1,9, Just because v6 is harder than 5.11 doesn't mean that the recommendation doesn't make sense.  If all you do is climb routes~ then 5.11 is a pretty good benchmark.  Anyone who is still operating in the 10's doesn't really have any business using a fingerboard (at least not this one) and probably isn't going to benefit much from trying.   If all you do is boulder then v5-v6 is a pretty good benchmark as well.  Most people who boulder exclusively can attain that grade by just bouldering~ and not worrying about any extra training.  However~ a boulderer who is climbing v3-v4 will benefit more from bouldering than fingerboard workouts~ which is why the OP gives the grade he does.,May 2009,Apr 9 2013,0

9894,Edelweiss Ropes,1,0, Anyone climb on Edelweiss ropes? I've been climbing with Mammut's for a few years now but a screaming deal on these guys has come up.    Comments and/or complaints much appreciated~ especially about wear and tear.    Thanks~ Nick,Jul 2008,Apr 2 2013,0
9895,Edelweiss Ropes,1,1, I've been climbing on Edelweiss ropes exclusively over the last 5 years.   That's after almost a decade of climbing on Mammuts.   I think there are several brands that wear well with a nice hand~ but Mammuts for many years seemed to me to wear and handle the best.   That said~ after climbing on a couple of Edelweiss cords a handful of years ago I believe them to be of the same or better quality.   They seem to wear a little better these days with a little less sheath slippage.  They're slightly firmer in hand~ but that comes with smother travel over rock and less fuzz.  Any of the major rope brands seem to be great at this point.  Try them out.    Also - try the search function.  there are many threads regardign ropes that could answer your question.,Oct 2011,Apr 2 2013,0
9896,Edelweiss Ropes,1,2, My first kernmantle rope back in early 70's... Edelweiss has a great history and I still have some of their ropes..latest was the 9.8 60M rope mentioned here at MP that was on ebay for like 80 bucks a couple months ago. Nothing wrong with their ropes.,Nov 2007,Apr 2 2013,0
9897,Edelweiss Ropes,1,3, Thanks Patrick~    Yea I'm not sure why I didn't just search haha~ but your quick answer is much appreciated.  I'm going with the Energy and maybe a set a halfs as well..,Jul 2008,Apr 2 2013,0
9898,Edelweiss Ropes,1,4, sounds like you already made your decision~ but i have had an edelweiss onsight 9.8 for a couple years. it has held up great~ and has been up at least 100 pitches. some dirty trad~ and has taken some good sport falls. still has a nice feel. enjoy.,Mar 2010,Apr 2 2013,0

9900,Edelweiss Ropes,1,6, I have used the Energy 9.5 and Performance 9.2 for the last couple of years and have been pretty impressed. Both have a nice hand and the dry treatment works really well. Out of the package they are super slick due to the way the sheath is woven and fly through the Gri-Gri (which I dont like) so actually a little wear does good things for these ropes. I can't comment too much on the durability because I have 3 ropes that I rotate through~ so none have been subjected to really intense use. So far so good~ they've broken in nicely   If there a is great deal on them I say go for it. If they happen to wear out a couple weeks earlier than another rope~ its not such a big deal given the cost savings.,Nov 2007,Apr 2 2013,0
9901,Edelweiss Ropes,1,7, So where is this deal?,Nov 2007,Apr 2 2013,0
9902,Edelweiss Ropes,1,8, Nick~ I have been exclusive Edelweiss for the past five years~ the Energy is the only single I use (strictly a trad climber though)~ Oxygen are my doubles for rock~ and Helium are my twins for rock and ice use.  Can't say enough good things about them~ they are all great performers.  I climb full time~ sandstone half the year~ Canadian Rockies (glacier-rock) the other half.  Durability has proven exceptional.  Good Luck.,Mar 2006,Apr 2 2013,0
9903,Edelweiss Ropes,1,9, Edelweiss PErformance 9.2 was one of my most durable ropes to date and certainly my favorite. I'm climbing on a Mammut Eternity now and would consider them to have many of the same characteristics. The Edelweiss had a slighty better hand~ the Mammut seems to have a tighter sheath....It may be more durable in the long run~ but I beat that Edelweiss like it owed me money and ultimately retired it because of age~ not wear. Also just retired a set of Edelwiess doubles after many years of use. Similarly durable with a nice hand.,Jan 2007,Apr 3 2013,0

9907,Edelweiss Ropes,1,13," The Clymb Deals are mainly for Edelweiss's entry level ropes while the Axis is an ""older"" generation model. They are a pretty good deal though.  Ebay has a reseller dealing those ropes at similar prices so don't sweat it if The Clymb sells out.   This is probably TMI but I'm bored and the kids are quiet...   I personally really like the Edelweiss ropes.  One of the best ropes I ever owned was a 70m ARC ""On Sigh"" 9.9mm.  That sucker took a ton of abuse - IC~ Eldo~ WA Granite~ Kalymnos - you name it.  It held up amazingly well.  I ended up retiring it because it just got old. Nothing alarming on the sheath etc.  Just old   Keep in mind that EVERYONES opinion on ropes~ including my own~ is extremely subjective and anecdotal.  There's almost no way people can accurately evaluate rope durability beyond guessing.  It only takes a rope running over one sharp edge/crystal while lowering to fuzz up a sheath.  There are so many variables on that front that without lab style testing we're all kind of making it up.   Things like how a rope handles~ feels~ knots etc etc are a little bit easier to comment on but still can range all over the map.  ""My X Brand rope was supper kinky"" (Did they do a sucky job of uncoiling it?  Did they lower through some single Fixe rings and twist it all to sh*t?) You just don't know.  Hell~ most of the time you don't even know what model/year the rope a person is talking about.  That can make a huge difference as companies do change up how they make their ropes - Beal (in my experience as well as others ;) ) used to have sheath wear issues - They introduced their ""Dry Cover"" tech and~ in my opinion~ vastly improved their line.  The rope names didn't change mind you~ just the sheath treatment.   The best way to gauge people's opinions on ropes is to see if their other observations match you own.  Someone who~ for example~ says Beal's are really stiff ropes doesn't have a lot of weight with me...   Even then~ it's kind of a crap shoot...",Jun 2006,Apr 3 2013,0
9908,Edelweiss Ropes,1,14, Thank you everyone for all the feedback! I didn't know my thread would generate so many edelweiss fans~ I'm psyched to try them out.

9910,Edelweiss Ropes,1,16, I had an Edlweiss rope and I'll never buy another one.   It was fiercely kinky (I flaked it dozens of ones before the first use~ and flaked it subsequent to each use~ yet it still kinked like a steel cable on every climb).  It also developed snags in the sheath from just a few gentle uses.  With my Mammut and Sterling ropes I have not had either of these problems.,Sep 2011,Apr 4 2013,0
9911,Edelweiss Ropes,1,17, I have used both Edelweiss and Mammut and have had good luck with both honestly. My fav has been Mammut with a price tag of around $140 for a 60m x 10.1 rope. And my Mammut is great.   I have a BN $190 Sterling Sharma 60m x 9.8 and every Sterling that my buds and I have tried kinks and twists on us like crazy - no matter what we try! From flaking it out in a pile~ to hanging it off the crag to stretch out~ and rapping using ATC's - doesn't seem to make any difference. My Mammut NEVER kinks or twists and me and wears like iron!,Jul 2011,Apr 8 2013,0
9912,Edelweiss Ropes,1,18, The edelweis axis is~ for me~ a one season rope. The one I had got fuzzy and fat faster than my other ropes. That said if you are hard up for a rope and don't have much cash it will do for a few months. If you have $200 or so get something better~ including the higher end Edelweis ropes which I have been consistently impressed with.    Another option are some of the Edelrid ropes which I would rank up there with Mammut or sterling. but be careful they also make an axis level rope~ which I think I actually like more than the axis.   Sorry I can't remember any of the names~ which all sound very similar.,Oct 2006,Apr 8 2013,0
9913,5.10 Stonelands VCS sizing???,1,0, I wear an 8.5 in my Anasazi VCS and a 9 in my old leather Asym's.  Does anyone know how they might size the 5.10 Stonelands?

9914,5.10 Stonelands VCS sizing???,1,1, hey preston~ i work for 5.10 and have climbed in all the shoes you mention. i have climbed in all the new stonelands~ and the VCS is lined leather~ so expect minimal stretch. i personally find they fit really well at street shoe size for all around climbing. i find that the same size in stonelands as anasazi is a slightly tighter fit. the whole last is different than any other five ten shoes. i think when you try them on in a shop you will see what i mean.   the toe box has more room for your outside toes~ with less point or turn in at the big toe...very comfy yet still a solid position for edging~ and more room for the outside toes to lie flat...great for jamming cracks.    i have climbed in these styles in both street shoe size and a half size down~ and prefer the fit at street shoe size. for really tight fitting super technical shoes i still prefer anasazi. its nice to not have to deal with stretch and the subsequent break-in period that lined upper provide. if you do choose to fit these very tight~ the lining will resist stretching~ but over time they will give some.   hope this helps~ happy sending!,Apr 2013,Apr 7 2013,0

9932,'Bombproof' HardShell Suggestions,1,16, It depends somewhat on when you leave.  I started Mar 13th and ran into snow a few times. Freezing rain is the real killer though. I had a fairly heavy fully taped rain jacket ($120 columbia) which was not very breathable but had some vents.  I wore it maybe 5 or 6 times in 10 weeks.    If I were starting again and had that budget to work with I would probably opt for a jacket similar to the one I had for the start and than a lightweight pullover for the rest of the trail. Maybe get the heavier jacket again when approaching Katahdin~ depending on how late in the year it is.   Many of the things you bring you will probably find you do not need. Some big ones for me were:   Heavy mid height hiking boots - totally unnecessary once you get pack weight down.   Tons of fuel - test how much you will use in a day so you aren't carrying 3 weeks worth.   Rope / big knives / gun / bow and arrow (I didn't bring a weapons but plenty of people do.) - you are not Grizzly Adams. You aren't going to be hunting or defending yourself from wild animals.  A 3 finger knife and some 550 cord is more than enough.   Water filter - not worth the weight~ use tablets.   Whisper Lite - I started with one and it's great~ but most meals are made by boiling water~ so an alcohol stove is much lighter and does the trick.  If you are going to get fancy~ than a whisper or simmer light is probably worth it.  You can only eat so much Ramen and Tuna.   Try to get fruit and veggies in whenever you can.  You should indulge a bit when you're in town~ you'll be dropping a lot of weight~ but don't eat too much greasy shit. After eating clean for weeks you will get sick.,Jan 2012,Mar 21 2013,0
9933,'Bombproof' HardShell Suggestions,1,17, I have the Arc'teryx alpha SL.  I like it quite a bit.  Simple and lightweight.  My two complaints are (1) the hood is enormous~ not even my ski helment fills the space and (2) it's cut a bit short in the front and will ride up and come out from under a harness.   You could also consider the Patagonia super cell which is similar to the alpha SL but cheaper and cut longer.   Nevertheless~ in my opinion and in my system a hard shell is more of an emergency piece that comes out when either my softshell outer layer ain't enough or it starts raining.  In other words~ the hardshell stays in the bottom of my pack 99.9% of the time.   I know it will rain on the AT~ but I just don't think goretex is necessary so it might behoove you to look into lighter weight shells.

9937,'Bombproof' HardShell Suggestions,2,0, I've taken bombproof hardshells on extended trips and always found them overkill. I've done probably 200 miles on the AT over the past 10 years and an all-mountain shell is overkill. For 3 season hiking I take my Patagonia Torrentshell Pullover. It's a great hardshell~ doesn't breath as well~ but is very light and protects well.    If you talk to hardcore thru-hikers~ they usually send their shells home and buy a cheap sil-nylon poncho/tarp that doubles as shelter and rain protection for themselves and their pack.

9938,'Bombproof' HardShell Suggestions,2,1," I have no idea why I was thinking ""pants"" when I gave my first suggestion~ must have been one of those late-night MP sessions when I just couldn't sleep.     Anyway~ I know your original post said you preferred gore or event~ and a lot of people followed that by suggesting that a $325 shell might be overkill.  I suppose this is relative on what kind of deal you can land but overall~ I would have to agree. I have an Alpha LT now that fits my skinny-ass great! I found it for $380 and even though its only 13oz~ I wouldn't use it for hiking only.  Assuming your sole purpose for this jacket is hiking~ I wouldn't shell out the extra cash. There are cheaper alternatives.     I have been looking into the Marmot Essence jacket~ ~8oz.  $190.  I have not tried it on yet so don't know how athletic the fit will be.   I also considered the OR Helium ~6oz.  $150~ but when i tried it on at the store a climbing helmet wouldn't really fit under it too well so that jacket isn't practical for my purposes.  Marmot also has a jacket in the same ""category"" as the two aforementioned. It's a tad lighter than the Precip.  I'm sure its decent but there is some ugly black crap they decided to put on the shoulders that really annoys the hell out of me.  Didn't even bother trying it on.   Have fun on your trip!",Jan 2001,Mar 23 2013,0
9939,'Bombproof' HardShell Suggestions,2,2, If you plan on keeping it a while~ go heavier (nice shoulder and waist protection)~ but~ honestly~ I bet a $100-$150 ultralight would get you a couple seasons with a full pack.

9946,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,0, We think this shoe is great for your first purchase. Here's why: cruxcrush.com/2013/03/29/ge…,Mar 2013,Mar 29 2013,0
9947,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,1, It's not so simple.  Sure~ that may be a great first shoe for some female climbers~ but I gotta say - there's no substitute for trying things on~ and there's a lot of variation in foot shape.  Also~ re: the review; I think I see far more women in the La Sportiva Miura.,Nov 2007,Mar 29 2013,0
9948,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,2, I totally agree that we're simplifying here and there is definitely variation between foot shape~ etc. However~ these shoes have worked well for a lot of beginners that I know.   I also agree that the Miura is a great shoe (I'm on my 2nd pair of them)~ and while this could be someone's first shoe I think it's a little more aggressive than most people need when they're just learning how to edge~ twist their hips~ etc. Totally depends on how much you want to dive right into climbing and get aggressive or ease in and be a little more comfortable.   Compared to the Miura the Elektra is also more affordable which might appeal to newbies who aren't sure if they're hooked on climbing yet or just enjoying it for the moment.    Thanks for the thoughts!!,Mar 2013,Mar 29 2013,0

9950,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,4," The Elektra is the women's version of the Defy. The reason you see so many beginners in these shoes is because they are pretty tame (comfortable)~ they're the cheapest shoe (MSRP)~ and I know that the gym I climbed in when I first started climbing offered a beginner package with the Defy/Elektra~ harness~ and ATC for a pretty discounted rate. I started out with the Defy and in terms of performance~ it did exactly what it needed to do for a beginner climber.   That being said~ the Defy/Elektra is notorious for being stinky. I started climbing at the same time as 3 other people and after a few months everybody's shoes started getting really rank even though none of us had a history of foot odor. Over the months that followed we tried EVERYTHING we could to get rid of the stink; some methods worked for a couple weeks but it would always come back with a vengeance. I was embarrassed to climb within 15 feet of anybody else in the gym~ it really was that bad. Eventually it got to the point where we had no choice but to just throw them out and buy new shoes (probably after about a year total).   I now own 6 other pairs of shoes~ and none of them have this problem. I still have the Miuras that I bought to replace my Defys~ which are about 5 years old and on their 4th resole. Another pair of Miuras are 3 years old and on their 2nd resole. (I just got the tracking number for my 3rd pair of Miuras~ too...yay!) My other shoes have been worn less than these~ but I""m sure they've all been worn about as much as the Defy's were. I've never once had to use any sort of deodorizer on any of these shoes~ and I could put my nose right in any pair and take a big whiff without being bothered.   Mine is far from the only account of this. A quick search on MP for threads about the Defy will show many similar stories. I think it has to do with the synthetic materials used in these shoes~ which is why I only ever buy leather now~ but I think even synthetic materials from other companies don't have this problem either.   Long story short: I would never~ ever~ ever recommend these shoes to anybody.",May 2010,Mar 29 2013,0
9951,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,5, I could perosnally care less about my shoes stinking but the defys were the worst pair of climbing shoes ive ever owned.,Aug 2011,Mar 29 2013,0

9953,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,7," And for the record: the shoe I've worn for the longest time as a ""comfortable shoe"" is the old Five Ten Hueco - the maroon version.  Leather~ no stink~ has conformed perfectly to the shape of my foot.  But in my quest to find a new comfortable shoe I've tried on a lot of different models and I ended up going with the La Sportiva Mythos.   Again I'd say that trying things on is absolutely necessary - I've tried to mail-order shoes and I almost inevitably send them back for sizing issues.",Nov 2007,Mar 29 2013,0
9954,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,8, I'm really happy with my defys. They've held up great to tons of abuse.

9957,Evolv Elektra - A Great Shoe for New Female Climbers,1,11," ""spray lysol in em""    Not the best idea!   Best idea is to WASH your feet before heading out and to remove your shoes between climbs as often as possible to let them dry out as much as possible.   Also~ using foot powders only creates a stranger STINK. Doesn't really STOP the STINK.   And of course get LEATHER shoes or accept that synthetics are going to SMELL because they will!",Oct 2002,Mar 30 2013,0

9959,is CLIMB X protection any good?,1,0, As far as I know Climb X has alot of similarities (somewhat identical) to Mad Rock. I know mad rock has good products so I assume Climb X has similar quality products. I know these two companies are in the market to provide the best products for the most affordable price. So to my question(s). Is Climb X's X-Tech pro any good. Honestly I haven't heard or read anything on it~ except from the climb x site~ which makes me think its not worth getting. Is their pro based off of any other companies products? I know protection is nothing to bargain hunt on but I'm going to start building my own rack and if their cams are solid their bundle appears to be a good place to start.   Thanks for the help.

9967,is CLIMB X protection any good?,1,8, Mad rock makes Decent stuff... but if you notice 90% of real mountain shops do not carry them. REI does not count as a mountain shop. Climb x is in my opinion: a knockoff of a brand that the world could do without. Sure mad rock and climb x are great for noobs~ but should not be taken seriously for quality gear. Also Just because cams are produced commercially does not mean they should be.   My experience with climb x is: I threw out all the gear I bought from them except the shoes which i loan out now. Buy good gear once and be done with it. I bought shitty gear first and am now buying gear all over again less than 2 years from buying it. ive done less than 20 trad climbs and I hate my cams because i bought a cheap set.
