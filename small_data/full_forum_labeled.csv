1222,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,15,isn't the whole point of having the quick-release locks on it to make it easy to take down? i wouldn't care at all that it didn't look quite as sleek~ as long as i could take it down (which i would do even if it was the sexiest-looking hangboard ever~ because my bedroom door would be unusable with it mounted) and i got to use the hangboard of my choice,Aug 2019,Jun 20 2020,1,1,1.0

2968,sizing for all day,1,6,you can size them down and they’ll still be relatively comfortable after breaking in while retaining performance.  with the pointy toe and downturn you’ll have to size katanas fairly big to wear them all day which may lead to dead space,Jul 2014,Jul 6 2020,0,2,

2988,Belay glasses,1,2,only problem is that the attachment clip to clip to your sunglasses or prescription glasses only accommodates a thin junction between top of lens or nose piece and the lens on the sunglasses or prescription glasses,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,2,0,0.0
2989,Belay glasses,1,2,this is not a problem for prescription glasses as few have a large junction~ but many sunglasses have thick plastic across the top of the glasses and the attachment clip won't accommodate that and doesn't seem to accommodate being bent (part of clip is plastic and can't be bent~ the metal part of clip seems like it would break if you tried to bent it),Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,2,0,0.0

3016,Belay glasses,1,9,those sunglasses have about the widest nose bridge that these clip ups would fit on - by that i mean it has to be quite narrow as the spring clips need to clamp onto the lens area near the nose and if frame is wide at top the attachment clip won't engage,Sep 2018,Jul 5 2020,1,0,0.0
3017,Belay glasses,1,9,that being said~ the small format of these clip ups and the ability to flip them up out of the way while they are still attached is awfully nice (not affiliated with company~ my neck is just happy that i am using them),Sep 2018,Jul 5 2020,1,2,2.0

3305,New Scarpa Mago reviews,1,3,the underfoot/wrap-around randing is way ahead of the teste design in terms of how comfortable it is for the power/precision it provides~ as it doesnt rely on the achilles-busting slingshot heel rand that many shoes past and present use to produce power in the toebox,Nov 2012,May 17 2020,1,2,2.0

3365,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,i've seen the reepschnur described and diagrammed here on mp~ and what i saw looked kind of scary,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,1,

3367,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,i just tied the tag line and my lead rope together using either a double fisherman's or a edk~ and left a long tail if i was using a edk,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,1,
3368,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,if we were doing multiple rappers we would feed the side we were pulling into the next rap anchor to save time~ so half the time the tag line was through the anchor and half the time the lead line was through the anchor,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,1,
3369,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,the only problems i recall we're that the 7mm was more susceptible to abrasion than a fatter line~ and i it was more likely to jam in a crack while being pulled after a rappel,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,0,
3370,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,the light weight and low cost were really nice~ but rapping on a 7mm line so many partners nervous that i went to an 8mm tag line,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,0,
3371,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,the other problem was that~ if the tag line was through the anchor~ the knot would creep down from the anchor because of the difference in friction between the tag line and the lead line,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,0,
3372,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,we had to watch the ends carefully to keep from going off the end of the 7mm line~ even if we started the rappel with the rope ends perfectly even,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,1,
3373,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2,people get nervous about rapping on a 7mm line~ but the truth is that it's plenty strong,Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1,1,

3375,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,3,i think if the rope is pulled over a tight angle as it pulls~ it will twist and kink up like that,Jun 2013,Jul 22 2014,0,1,

3381,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,4,as for a knots~ we just tie a figure 8 in one rope and connect it to a figure 8 in the other (figure 8 to figure 8),Jun 2011,Jul 22 2014,0,1,
3382,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,4,the only drawback is that you always have to pull down the tag line on multi-raps~ so if a rope gets stuck on the way down it's likely to be the lead line,Jun 2011,Jul 22 2014,0,0,

3386,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,what this the first time that you used the 7 mm cord? because the new cords often come in a spool and need some time to get the kinks out,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,1,
3387,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,also~ i have comment about using two edk~ although it would have nothing to do with the tagle,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,0,
3388,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,the edk is a good knot to use on rappel because it is compact and can flip,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,2,
3389,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,the down side of the knot is that is a relatively weak knot and the tails do slip,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,1,
3390,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,adding a second edk make the knot way more prone to getting stuck and have little effect on tail slippage,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,2,
3391,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,so it is best to make a decision either go with a knot that is less likely to get stuck (edk)or use a strong knot (double fishermen),Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,1,
3392,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5,presently you are using a weak knot that is most likely to get stuck.,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0,1,

3397,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,6,thread the single rope~ tie to locker (overhand/figure-8 on bight)~ lock back to single rope on other side of anchor (note that single is now self-secure)~ tie tag line to locker~ rap on single rope only~ keep control of tag line (clip to draw on gear loop~ for example)~ pull tag line,Apr 2013,Jul 22 2014,0,1,
3398,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,6,it sounds like you did a little bit of both,Apr 2013,Jul 22 2014,0,1,

3401,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,6,method 1 seems odd and perhaps unsafe due to the different rope diameters and types (static vs dynamic) through the rap device,Apr 2013,Jul 22 2014,0,0,

(actually now that i say this~ did you lark hitch that eye on the fixed end directly to your tie in loops or have it on a locker? was chafe an issue?)",Aug 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,1,
3548,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,yup~ a very short bury~ and intentional,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,1,
3549,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,these things hold by friction~ and reducing the bury reduces the friction~ thereby allowing you to get it to slip at a known force,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,1,
3550,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,it was remarkably consistent too,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,2,

3554,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,worked quite well in slow pull tests~ but never got around to drop tests and no longer have multiple strain gage indicators~ so can’t do multipoint force measurement and won’t be revisiting it,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,1,
3555,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,anyway~ i found it to work in dyneema too and only showed vectran as i knew where that one was,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,2,
3556,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,bury needs to be longer with dyneema due to how slippery it is,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,0,
3557,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,i tried pobon and technora as well~ and did not like how they behaved,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,0,
3558,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,the vectran and dyneema got a bit fuzzy after 20 or so pulls~ but still slipped at the expected force,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,0,
3559,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3,seems i did not post a chart of it in the other post~ but did share a page of my notes:  mountainproject.com/forum/t… but as for using whoopi slings in general~ arborists do it all the time~ so likely safe.,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0,1,

3580,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,5,the tx4 does have the advantage of durability for skiing scree or actual climbing~ but i'd still go with the tx3~ which will easily last a summer full of sierra adventures,Nov 2004,May 24 2020,8,2,

3810,Rappeling off an older rope,1,3,another thing to consider is if you wouldn't lead on it~ maybe you shouldn't rescue with it either (i.e,Jul 2013,Jul 2 2020,1,1,

3947,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,good morning i am a fairly new sport climber with a question about belaying from the top,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3948,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,there are a few wonderful routes at the obed in tn that have a wonderful view at the top and a really nice ledge to stand on while cleaning and such,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,2,
3949,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,i am wanting to start learning multi pitch sport climbing by working on bringing up a second on a single pitch,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3950,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,not ready for trad yet,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,0,
3951,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,belaying from the top seems pretty intuitive but i want to be damn sure i am ready for all the strange occurrences that can happen,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3952,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,building anchors are so very case dependent~ and i don’t really want to discuss them hear (but the quad anchor is what i will most likely build).  question: lowering a climbing from above,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3953,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,i have seen many different and fairly complicated methods,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3954,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,the dmm pivot seems to make things very streamlined,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,2,
3955,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0,is this really as simple and safe as it seems?https://vimeo.com/101652072 ​thanks!!,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3956,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,1,if your goal is to practice for multipitch~ i’d recommend rappelling the route instead of lowering the second. lowering another climber is something i almost never do on multipitch routes but transitioning from your anchor to a rappel is pretty common.,Apr 2017,Jun 21 2020,21,1,
3957,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,2,"i'd be hesitant to use guide mode when belaying from above on a typical obed roof (as a ""fairly new sport climber"")",Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,7,1,
3958,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,2,what's your plan if your 2nd falls in the roof?,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,7,1,
3959,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,3,that is the whole point of my question,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3960,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,3,it looks like the dmm pivot makes lowering pretty simple,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3961,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,3,it does not appear that i need to rig up slings to flip the atc,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3962,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,3,i would still think a prusik on my end would be needed however.,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,0,
3963,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,4,good point,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
3964,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,4,i am very comfortable with that (i was an arborist for 9 years~ self belaying and rigging was done on the daily).,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,

3967,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,5,it does not appear that i need to rig up slings to flip the atc,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,12,1,
3968,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,5,i would still think a prusik on my end would be needed however.  yeah~ it would definitely be better than a lot of comparable devices,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,12,0,
3969,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,5,i'd still be hesitant (depending on the route) as it's an extra complication and sometimes communication can be tricky around a roof or bulge.,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,12,1,
3970,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,6,i have considered that for sure,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3971,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,6,i could then use a grigri,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3972,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,6,my concern with that was:,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3973,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,7,the biggest factors for me in deciding how i am going to belay from the top are # 1,Oct 2010,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
3974,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,7,partners competence and secondly but still very important~ anchor location in relation to belay stance,Oct 2010,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
3975,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,7,super helpful to situate the master point above you when belaying in guide mode and always important to reduce friction as much as you can in guide mode,Oct 2010,Jun 21 2020,1,2,
3976,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,7,taking up slack can be a bit nuanced when in guide mode~ i like to have a hand occasionally  on the climbers strand to monitor the slack situation.overhangs and belays back from the edge are good candidates for not using guide mode in most cases.,Oct 2010,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
3977,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,i use a grigri to belay from the top 99% of the time for both sport and trad multipitch,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,1,
3978,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,it’s so simple and worth the money,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,1,
3979,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,slap it onto your anchor and pull the rope,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,1,
3980,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,lowering is easy as well as you redirect the brake-strand rope and  pull the lever,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,2,
3981,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,otherwise~ i belay with an atc from my harness and redirect the rope,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,1,
3982,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,however~ if you’re getting into multipitch~ i would bring your second up then rappel down rather than lowering,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,1,
3983,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,it’s also nice to just get your second up and sit on the cliffside together,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,2,
3984,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8,that’s the best part of climbing taller stuff.,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14,1,
3985,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,9,you might want to edit your comment to mention that you need to redirect the brake strand before lowering,Nov 2017,Jun 21 2020,5,1,
3986,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,9,you don’t *just* pull the lever,Nov 2017,Jun 21 2020,5,1,
3987,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,10,put your gri gri on the anchor to belay,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,5,1,
3988,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,10,be aware that the camming action could be compromised if the device gets jammed against the rock by the weight of a climber on the rope,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,5,1,
3989,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,10,if you need to lower~ it is much easier,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,5,1,
3990,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,10,i'd still recommend a friction knot on the brake side of the rope just in case~ or a big stopper knot tied in the brake side a few feet away.,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,5,1,
3991,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,11,thanks!!,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,

3994,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,12,yikes~ thank you !!,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
3995,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,13,i have considered that for sure,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3996,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,13,i could then use a grigri,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3997,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,13,my concern with that was: 1,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3998,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,13,not an issue~ not enough force to be worried about,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
3999,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,14,thanks!! i’ve never had a problem with this,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,2,0,
4000,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,14,make sure the masterpoint of the anchor is far enough away from the wall so that it doesn’t have the opportunity to jam,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,2,2,
4001,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,14,go indirect (with a clove hitch in the rope)~ and kind of weight the anchor so it gets pulled away from the wall if you can.,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
4002,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,15,i have considered that for sure,Mar 2014,Jun 21 2020,4,1,
4003,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,15,i could then use a grigri,Mar 2014,Jun 21 2020,4,1,
4004,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,15,my concern with that was: clip the gri-gri to the anchor~ don't fuss around with a re-direct,Mar 2014,Jun 21 2020,4,1,
4005,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,15,test the action on the cam to make sure there are no obstacles trapping it shut,Mar 2014,Jun 21 2020,4,2,
4006,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,15,now you're good to go.,Mar 2014,Jun 21 2020,4,1,
4007,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,i have considered that for sure,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4008,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,i could then use a grigri,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4009,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,my concern with that was: if it's a modern bolted anchor i wouldn't consider 1 to be a serious concern (really i wouldn't stress about it on almost any anchor except for some kind of sketchy tied off rhodo nest),Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,0,
4010,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,and personally i don't stress about 2,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4011,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,that much,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4012,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,plus~ as it's a single pitch climb you are talking about~ you can just lower off the second and consider the belay effectively escaped,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4013,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,for 3~ i wouldn't worry too much either unless the difference is really dramatic,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,0,
4014,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,especially if a roof is in play~ the friction on the rope is going to add a lot of resistance,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4015,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16,but if it is a concern~ you can just hang the grigri on the anchor directly~ as others have alluded to (i don't use a grigri often so i won't presume to speak to nuances with that method).,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4016,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,17,said it once here on mp~ and i’ll say it again,Sep 2012,Jun 21 2020,10,1,
4017,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,17,op i think attempting to follow the information from an online forum is an accident waiting to happen,Sep 2012,Jun 21 2020,10,1,
4018,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,17,i’d consider hiring a guide so you know you can do it correctly,Sep 2012,Jun 21 2020,10,1,
4019,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,17,it’s not worth hurting yourself or your partner,Sep 2012,Jun 21 2020,10,1,
4020,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,17,you might learn some other awesome skills in the process,Sep 2012,Jun 21 2020,10,1,
4021,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,17,stay safe,Sep 2012,Jun 21 2020,10,1,

4024,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,19,100%! i like to learn as much as i can before i hire a guide so that i can ask relevant questions and get the most out of the time together.,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
4025,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,20,i concur~ but you don't need a guide~ you just need someone who can show you in person.,Jun 2019,Jun 21 2020,3,1,
4026,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,1,if you can position yourself such that the anchor bolts are even slightly above you~ you can build an identical configuration to a toprope,Jul 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
4027,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,1,that will be the most familiar and safest way to belay and lower a second from the top.,Jul 2019,Jun 21 2020,2,1,
4028,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,2,if you are belaying directly off the anchor with a grigri~ or atc type in guide mode~ you do not need to be able to escape the belay~ because you are not directly attached to it.,Nov 2008,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
4029,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,3,you're not going to be belaying from the top on any of the obed roof climbs,Jan 2016,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4030,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,3,probably more likely best seat~ spawn~ or something similar,Jan 2016,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4031,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,3,i'd use a grigri off the anchor to belay that way.,Jan 2016,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4032,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,4,that is the whole point of my question,Aug 2019,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4033,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,4,it looks like the dmm pivot makes lowering pretty simple,Aug 2019,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4034,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,4,it does not appear that i need to rig up slings to flip the atc,Aug 2019,Jun 21 2020,1,1,
4035,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,4,i would still think a prusik on my end would be needed however.  just do a weighted lsd lower~ i’ll find you a video,Aug 2019,Jun 21 2020,1,2,
4036,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,5,op here: spawn is exactly the route i had i mind,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
4037,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,5,did you helped to check the link to the dmm pivot that i attached in my original question?,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
4038,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,6,right~ my original question was about lowering a climber should something happen.,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0,1,
4039,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,7,"lowering a climber from above with a plaquette-style device in plaquette mode (aka ""something like the pivot"") is always a horror show~ and these devices have well-documented catastrophic failure criteria that are difficult to understand and conceptualize",Nov 2017,Jun 22 2020,11,1,

4073,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,11,you have much less friction lowering from the top (for a direct belay) than you do lowering from the ground,Nov 2009,Jun 29 2020,0,1,

4077,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,13,any properly sized and positioned re-direct is sufficient,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,4,2,
4078,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,13,i promise that once you go to grigri for top belay and multi-pitch~ you'll never go back,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,4,0,
4079,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,13,it gives so much less friction compared to a plate device in guide mode~ which means it's waaay less tiring to pull in rope,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,4,0,
4080,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,13,in terms of pure energy expenditure~ the efficiency gained here totally offsets the weight of the device,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,4,1,

4084,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,15,in a scenario with multipitch routes over big roofs~ especially if there is any traversing angle to the route~ a very useful thing is for the second to have a microascender or prussik and know how to ascend the rope,May 2015,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4085,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,15,you can't alway guarantee that a lower will bring your second back to the lower belay station~ esp since they have removed gear between the lower anchor and themselves,May 2015,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4086,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,15,they could end up in space or having to pendulum sideways to reach the anchor again,May 2015,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4087,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,15,"if you are lowering them to the the ground~ yes~ you can usually lower them to the ground~ but even this is not always guaranteed~ routes that start on ledges with ground falling away from one side or the other is one scenario where a lower to the ""ground"" can still end with the second in a dicey situation.",May 2015,Jun 29 2020,1,1,

4090,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,16,obviously you should try to have the friction over the lip while using it~ but it works just fine without it,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,1,2,
4091,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,16,it's more tricky to control the lower~ certainly~ but the cam still engages just fine even on thin ropes,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
4092,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,16,either way~ you're not wrong~ it's best to redirect the brake strand over the lip.,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,1,1,

4106,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,0,for anyone who feels the need to post basic belaying/rappelling/protection placing questions~ where the answers could put someone's life at risk~ the easy answer is hire a certified guide,Jan 2001,Jun 30 2020,4,1,
4107,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,0,mountain project comments can be helpful or less than helpful.the problem is that newbie ops are rarely in a position to know the difference.,Jan 2001,Jun 30 2020,4,1,

4111,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,2,i concur~ but you don't need a guide~ you just need someone who can show you in person,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,4,1,
4112,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,2,that's true~ but when you're new~ it can be hard to discern the knowledgeable from those talking out of their asses,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,4,1,

4114,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,2,for a newbie wanted to learn a specific skill~ i think a guide is best if it's in the budget,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,4,1,
4115,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,2,any legit guide has some certifications showing he knows (or should know) what he's doing.,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,4,1,
4116,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,3,op~ i typically belay from above with an atc in guide mode only if there are two followers or i'm pretty damn sure my follower won't need to be lowered,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
4117,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,3,in the latter case~ i still prefer a grigri or other abd like a lifeguard or a birdie,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
4118,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,3,on multi-pitch~ i almost always carry both an atc and a grigri,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,0,1,

4129,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,5,i tie off with a clove hitch and a locking biner a few feet (at least an arm and a half if the climb allows) below the anchor~ and then redirect the rope from the anchor and belay them just like i would do a normal top rope belay from the bottom,Apr 2019,Jul 1 2020,0,1,
4130,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,5,my climbing partner is significantly heavier than me~ and i have never had a problem when he falls with getting sucked into the redirect.,Apr 2019,Jul 1 2020,0,0,
4131,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,the number of people that use a redirect off the anchor for a second is somewhat shocking to me and reflects the lack of experience of the posters~ imo,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4132,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,this guarantees that the belayer will be pulled off their stance if a heavier climber falls below them crashing them into the anchor and potentially compromising the belay,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4133,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,doubt this? have someone surprise place 200# in your hands and see how it turns out,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4134,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,the way to bring up the second is either with the device on the anchor itself (grigri or guide mode) or~ if using a gg or standard tube then belay off of the rope loop formed by your harness tie in and let the anchor take all the weight this way,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4135,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,adjust length via cloves to let you sit comfortably at the lip to maintain vision and communication with the second and let the anchor take the weight if they fall,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,2,
4136,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,you are also in perfect position to lower them if you choose to get them back on the ground quickly and safely,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,2,
4137,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,this can be much easier than rigging a rappel keeping things nice and clean rather than having two at the belay needing to use some form of pas to untie from the rope at what can be an awkward and crowded belay,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,2,
4138,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,much easier for one to do it with his partner already out of the way,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,2,
4139,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6,unbelievable that so many don't know this climbing 101 yet post like they have experience using a redirect when they really don't seem to know the consequences.,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4140,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,7,good stance tight rope from harness to anchor running in direction of pull of climber rope running thru biner clipped to the loop formed by the tie in figure 8 knot on guide hand side gloves good communication using both verbal and rope signals hip belay,Dec 2019,Jul 1 2020,0,1,
4141,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,8,aaand now we've covered every possibility,Jul 2009,Jul 1 2020,1,1,

4143,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,9,to answer your question~ yes,Feb 2016,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4144,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,9,the dmm pivot is very simple to use for lowering your second.,Feb 2016,Jul 1 2020,1,2,

4146,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,0,hi there! i have been using the petzl dual connect adjust for a bit now and i find it quite bulky especially cause of the fixed arm,Jun 2020,Jun 29 2020,0,2,
4147,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,0,i am thinking to cut off the fixed arm and i was wondering if that would compromise somehow the safety? thank you in advance!,Jun 2020,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
4148,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,1,get a sling of the correct length~ put two overhand knots in it~ one at the end and one at 1/3rd-ish of the length~ sell the dual adjust~ problem solved,Feb 2020,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4149,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,1,in general i don't think it is recommendable to put a scissor in a life-line~ no matter how it is constructed.,Feb 2020,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4150,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,2,you should sell that one and just buy the adjust~ the one with just a single adjustable arm.,Sep 2017,Jun 29 2020,3,1,
4151,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,3,i cut off the fixed arm~ and i am much happier with it,Aug 2013,Jun 29 2020,4,2,
4152,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,3,i just use the adjustable arm as pas and a separate sling/draw for extending my rappel device,Aug 2013,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
4153,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,3,i cannot imagine there being a safety issue~ as long as you properly seal the cut end to keep it from fraying,Aug 2013,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
4154,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,4,i was thinking the same about that,Jun 2020,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4155,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,4,but might try to sell it and buy the one without the fixed arm~ if not i will most likely cut it.,Jun 2020,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
4156,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,5,you can also build a percell prusik that will give you the same functionality for about $2 worth of 6mm cord.,Aug 2018,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
4157,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,6,after using the single adjust for a while~ then being disappointed with the dual connect adjust's stumpy fixed arm~ i cannibalized the adjusty parts of both~ added a length of retired rope~ and now have a two-armed frankenadjust~ where both sides are the same as the good side of the dual,Mar 2017,Jun 29 2020,0,0,
4158,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,6,highly recommended - being able to go into both bolts and adjust both arms are great features to have.,Mar 2017,Jun 29 2020,0,2,

4160,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,8,petzl sold this configuration for a bit~ i believe it was called the aid adjust,Jun 2014,Jun 29 2020,1,1,

4166,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,13,i would have few reservations with using the evolv adjust as a personal lanyard~ despite petzl’s warnings.the 15 kn static strength requirement for personal lanyards seems overly conservative to me for a dynamic rope,Aug 2013,Jun 29 2020,0,1,

4192,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,1,20,if you're up there cleaning on a sport climb with only the connect adjust clip it into the two draws (or masterpoint~ or whatever) that are hanging off the bolts~ not one of the bolts themselves,Aug 2012,Jul 1 2020,0,1,

4195,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,0,definitely - that's how i originally did it~ but then wanted the easy slide ability of the connect to weight the new system~ but that left me only on one bolt~ unless i used another pas (which i'm then only using for one bolt~ instead of the normal two that it can do),Mar 2017,Jul 1 2020,0,1,
4196,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,0,a frustrating circle of not-quite-enough solutions~ but now i'm happy with the double-armed connect hybrid :),Mar 2017,Jul 1 2020,0,1,

4201,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,1,or you could buy a metolius pas which is lighter and can be clipped shorter,Feb 2009,Jul 1 2020,0,2,
4202,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,1,what benefit are you getting from the petzl product that you wouldn’t get from these cheaper and less bulky alternatives?,Feb 2009,Jul 1 2020,0,1,
4203,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,2,another option with the single leg connect adjust is to replace the rope with a slightly longer (and skinnier depending on usage) rope and then when two clip in points are needed just clove hitch a draw into the tail and clip in with that as well,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4204,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,2,this is the system i've been running for a couple years now,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,1,2,
4205,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,2,i replaced the rope with a piece of 8mm dynamic which obviously makes the the system a bit weaker but also a lot less bulky,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,1,2,
4206,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,2,i find the trade off worth it but like all lighter and weaker gear a bit more attention needs to be paid so might not be a good fit for others.,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,1,1,
4207,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,3,isn't that a special pas? it's just that you made it,Aug 2018,Jul 1 2020,0,1,
4208,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,3,i've made one too~ and the purcell is much more difficult to adjust and has a much smaller range than the petzl stuff,Aug 2018,Jul 1 2020,0,2,
4209,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,3,i find that it saves a lot of time getting onto rappel and lowering~ because of the easy motion and the ability to run it all the way out to get weight on the new system,Aug 2018,Jul 1 2020,0,2,
4210,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,3,everybody is free to value different characteristics differently~ but if you made and carry a purcell~ you definitely have a pas~ right? reread my comment,Aug 2018,Jul 1 2020,0,1,

4216,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,5,not even close to the same functionality~ and i say that with considerable experience with both systems.  the purcell has only half the range and is harder to adjust in all circumstances and especially hard-to-impossible to adjust if it is fully or partially weighted,Feb 2008,Jul 1 2020,4,1,

4225,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,8,the op doesn't explain what his use case is~ so gonna assume using the rope isn't an option or convenient (say while rappelling~ approaching a cliff from the top~ alpine climbing~ or say moving around on fixed lines),Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,0,1,
4226,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,8,for normal multi-pitch climbing with an easy descent (only a couple rappels) just using the rope is the way to go,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,0,1,

4230,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,8,i think if you don't use a pas/tether very often and price is more of a concern the slyde is a good alternative,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,0,1,

4240,Helmets in climbing,1,0,see the original thread here:mountainproject.com/forum/t… in the interest of providing a place to discuss helmets that is not co-mingled with this climber's accident and death~ i offer the following space,Dec 2009,Jun 11 2020,0,1,
4241,Helmets in climbing,1,0,we can go in any direction,Dec 2009,Jun 11 2020,0,1,
4242,Helmets in climbing,1,0,for example: 1-do you were a helmet?  always?  sometimes?  how do you decide? 2-do you think helmets should offer protection principally from falling objects (rocks~ gear~ and so on)~ or do you think helmets should also provide impact protection? 3-regarding your answers to question two above~ do you think helmets are well-designed~ or could they be improved? 4-are the protective benefits of wearing helmets exaggerated? could there be cases where helmets increase the chances of serious injury (there are parallel debate for cycling and skiing helmets? 5-there's been a trend toward lighter-weight soft foam helmets; good or bad? 6-should pros be encouraged to wear helmets more often~ as a way to increase the chances that others will?   ok~ that should be enough to get started...carry on,Dec 2009,Jun 11 2020,0,1,

4273,Helmets in climbing,1,9,he broke his arm and chipped some vertebrae~  he nearly lost a finger,Dec 2011,Jun 11 2020,11,1,
4274,Helmets in climbing,1,9,he was really lucky,Dec 2011,Jun 11 2020,11,1,

4302,Helmets in climbing,1,15,i wear my helmet for the vast majority of my trad climbing~ but will take it off for routes with squeeze/ow pitches or on routes where the falls are very safe/airy,Mar 2014,Jun 11 2020,3,1,
4303,Helmets in climbing,1,15,i am mostly concerned with hitting my head in a fall~ but the added protection from rockfall is useful as well,Mar 2014,Jun 11 2020,3,1,
4304,Helmets in climbing,1,15,i always wear a helmet when ice climbing,Mar 2014,Jun 11 2020,3,1,
4305,Helmets in climbing,1,15,i essentially never wear it for sport climbing,Mar 2014,Jun 11 2020,3,1,
4306,Helmets in climbing,1,15,i think helmets like the half done and helios are borderline useless,Mar 2014,Jun 11 2020,3,0,

4319,Helmets in climbing,1,19,it keeps my head warm~ and mostly cool~ better than hats~ mates up with my goggles nicely~ probably provides some protection~ and has speakers in it!,Oct 2008,Jun 11 2020,1,2,
4320,Helmets in climbing,1,20,hey bill i actually looked into this bike vs climbing helmet thing a bit when i was buy a helmet for my daughter (basically i was like wtf i don't want to buy two freakin helmets),Sep 2009,Jun 12 2020,0,1,
4321,Helmets in climbing,1,20,if i recall (?) the climbing helmets have better protection from objects falling from above than the bike helmets and bike helmets are better for side impacts,Sep 2009,Jun 12 2020,0,1,
4322,Helmets in climbing,1,20,they do make helmets for kids that are rated for both but i would not use a bike helmet as a climbing helmet..,Sep 2009,Jun 12 2020,0,1,
4323,Helmets in climbing,1,20,maybe the other way around though.,Sep 2009,Jun 12 2020,0,1,
4324,Helmets in climbing,2,0,i wear a helmet for 90% of my climbing (excluding bouldering),Sep 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4325,Helmets in climbing,2,0,occasionally i forget to put it on~ or will decide to not wear it on a wide crack,Sep 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4326,Helmets in climbing,2,0,i pretty much always wear one sport climbing,Sep 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4327,Helmets in climbing,2,0,ive seen too many falling rocks~ even at popular sport areas.,Sep 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4328,Helmets in climbing,2,1,with how light and low-profile modern helmets are~ there is absolutely no excuse for not wearing one~ at least while on the sharp end,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4329,Helmets in climbing,2,1,i wear one every time i'm leading anything,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4330,Helmets in climbing,2,1,it's just too easy to catch your foot on the rope or a draw or a ledge and flip~ and although most climbing helmets aren't perfect for side and rear impact~ it's better than nothing,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4331,Helmets in climbing,2,1,i also climb harder in a helmet--its a subtle signal to myself to get serious and try hard,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4332,Helmets in climbing,2,1,as far as wearing one on the ground for rockfall~ i do when the cliff seems unstable in some way,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4333,Helmets in climbing,2,1,typically sport climbing in an area with good rock~ i don't,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4334,Helmets in climbing,2,1,obviously risk is personal and i'll never give someone shit for not wearing a helmet while sport climbing~ although i'll talk to them about it if asked and explain why i wear one,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4335,Helmets in climbing,2,1,but! i think it's fucking bullshit when pros are photographed on the sharp end not wearing a helmet,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4336,Helmets in climbing,2,1,they make money off of the sport~ they're leaders in the sport~ and as such~ they have an obligation to set a good~ safe example,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4337,Helmets in climbing,2,1,if they are climbing on their own without photographers~ whatever~ that's their call,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4338,Helmets in climbing,2,1,but if you're hauling your photo crew out to snap some shots for the mags~ and you don't wear a helmet~ you're being a fucking selfish prick and the climbing media should collectively decide not to print that photo,Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4339,Helmets in climbing,2,1,"i don't see the other side of that argument--if you're saying shit about climbing's ""rebel spirit"" and individuality~ that doesn't address the point that someone who makes money off the sport has an obligation to set a good example.",Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4,1,
4340,Helmets in climbing,2,2,i would never wear a climbing helmet on a bike,Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4341,Helmets in climbing,2,2,my bike helmet is waaay thicker than my climbing helmet so should do more ti decelerate my head in a crash (the primary purpose of a bike helmet is for the foam structure to crush and allow you head a micro amount of additional time to decelerate drastically reducing g force so your brain smushes the inside of yours skull less hard) a parallel helmet question i have is mips?  my bike helmet has mips but it is bulkier than my old helmet without mips,Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4342,Helmets in climbing,2,2,i just saw an add for a helmet (bd i think) in climbing mag with mips,Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4343,Helmets in climbing,2,2,do i really need the added weight and size for climbing? for those who don't know~ mips allows the shell of the helmet to rotate independent of your head in a crash (at least a little)  research showed that a lot of brain injuries in cycling came when you fell on your side while moving forward and your head gets jerked in a twist when it impacts,Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4344,Helmets in climbing,2,2,(or something this is from memory) do we really have this kind of impact in climbing?  personally didn't wear a helmet when i started climbing but now i do,Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4345,Helmets in climbing,2,2,i do other helmet sports so it's easy for me to forget it's there~ i'm used to a helmet,Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4346,Helmets in climbing,2,2,also modern helmets are so nice and light.  and yes i do want it to protect me from impacts (not just falling rocks),Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1,1,

4349,Helmets in climbing,2,4,it only weighs 30g more than the non-mips version~ and doesn't add any noticeable bulk,Jul 2016,Jun 12 2020,0,1,
4350,Helmets in climbing,2,4,"it's basically a very thin web of plastic that provides isolation for the mounting points between the shell of the helmet and the ""harness"" that secures to your head.",Jul 2016,Jun 12 2020,0,1,

4362,Helmets in climbing,2,6,never ridden without one since,Jan 2018,Jun 12 2020,6,2,

4367,Helmets in climbing,2,7,it will always be better to have it on and to not need....than to need it for your protection and wish you hadn't left it behind,Sep 2014,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4368,Helmets in climbing,2,7,i'd be happy to show you what it looks like when you wish you had one on and did not.,Sep 2014,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4369,Helmets in climbing,2,9,i consider myself a helmet skeptic~ for exactly this reason: in other words~ people with helmets make riskier decisions that mitigate (some of) their benefits,Aug 2011,Jun 12 2020,0,1,
4370,Helmets in climbing,2,9,despite my skepticism~ i always wear a helmet while trad climbing~ almost always when sport climbing~ never when bouldering~ and never in the gym,Aug 2011,Jun 12 2020,0,1,

4378,Helmets in climbing,2,11,i also won't climb multipitch with anyone not wearing a helmet~ as the integrity of my partner's brain directly impacts my own safety,Dec 2016,Jun 12 2020,0,1,

4381,Helmets in climbing,2,12,it's my vague impression from reading accident reports that there are more head injuries from falls than from falling rocks~ but i would be happy to be proven wrong with actual data,Aug 2013,Jun 12 2020,5,1,
4382,Helmets in climbing,2,12,i sort of feel like people talk more about the falling rocks because they don't like to admit that they could make a mistake that would result in a head injury from falling,Aug 2013,Jun 12 2020,5,1,
4383,Helmets in climbing,2,12,i wear a helmet essentially always when roped climbing~ and sometimes when bouldering,Aug 2013,Jun 12 2020,5,1,
4384,Helmets in climbing,2,12,i have never suggested that anyone else wear one~ and i think it is seriously lame to suggest that pros should do something to set an example for the rest of us,Aug 2013,Jun 12 2020,5,1,
4385,Helmets in climbing,2,12,if your choice to wear a helmet is greatly influence by what the pros do~ i'm inclined to think you should fix your decision making process in general before you worry about whether to wear a helmet,Aug 2013,Jun 12 2020,5,1,
4386,Helmets in climbing,2,13,there is a reason brands sponsor climbers (or any athletes for that matter),Dec 2016,Jun 12 2020,1,1,

4390,Helmets in climbing,2,13,it’s basic human nature.,Dec 2016,Jun 12 2020,1,1,
4391,Helmets in climbing,2,14,"avoided cracking my skull in a big slab fall because i had a helmet - i didn't usually wear one at that time~ but luckily a mentor had always said ""if you ever wear a helmet~ wear it leading slab.""  got hit in the head with a couple small rocks - once in the valley~ once in owens",Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3,1,
4392,Helmets in climbing,2,14,both times were no big deal with the helmet on~ but the owens one left my ears ringing from the sharp sound! whacked my belayer straight in the head with a not-tiny flake (maybe 5 pounds from 30 feet off the belay~ flung down since i was yarding on it)~ she had a helmet on~ she was fine,Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3,0,
4393,Helmets in climbing,2,14,watched a friend break a similar sized rock and nail his belayer on the hand - missed his head by inches~ no helmet~ they were 500' up a wall and the rock fell around 50 feet,Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3,1,
4394,Helmets in climbing,2,14,luckily the belayer heard the sound of the fall and grabbed the rope below the atc with both hands~ since he wouldn't have been able to catch the fall otherwise (yet another argument for a gri-gri...),Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3,1,
4395,Helmets in climbing,2,14,a friend who's been doing new routes ground-up for 40 years and never wears a helmet managed to whack his head on a knob just while following me (sharp tuolumne knob~ small roof)~ bled quite a bit~ almost needed stitches,Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3,1,
4396,Helmets in climbing,2,14,still couldn't convince him to wear one~ but at least i got him to toss his crusty~ 30-year old harness - gave him one of mine under the condition that i watch him cut his old one up and toss it! op questions - always wear the helmet on lead (except tight squeeze chimneys)~ yes both impact and rockfall protection is needed~ always room for improvement in safety equipment~ protective benefits are not exaggerated~ can't think of a case where they'd increase injury chance (suppose you could strangle on it if you got really badly stuck in a squeeze chimney where you couldn't get your arms to the position to unclip it)~ light is great if they still perform~ pros can do what they want~ but manufacturers/retailers paying for the photos are also free to request that pros wear helmets in those photo shoots.,Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3,1,
4397,Helmets in climbing,2,15,its been said that serious injuries would be substantially reduced if even mountain walkers wore helmets,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4398,Helmets in climbing,2,15,i think this came from a mountain rescue team,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4399,Helmets in climbing,2,15,i've definitely been saved from serious head injury twice: once in a direct head first fall onto rock~ and once in a very long fall/slide while returning from a snow climb (lucky i hadn't removed it),May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4400,Helmets in climbing,2,15,in the first instance the coating from the crown of the helmet was splattered over the rock; the helmet was for climbing but had motorbike specifications~ good lateral protection and was very heavy by modern standards,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4401,Helmets in climbing,2,15,second instance the helmet ended up with a small hole above the forehead~ i have no memory of the fall,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,0,
4402,Helmets in climbing,2,15,in both cases my neck hurt for a long time; i later found that i had a healed fracture of a cervical vertebra which was almost certainly related,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,0,
4403,Helmets in climbing,2,15,i've also often been struck by small rocks and ice,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4404,Helmets in climbing,2,15,i now wear a helmet almost anywhere that i might slip including on the walk in or scrambling,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4405,Helmets in climbing,2,15,if i've got a helmet in my pack it might just as well be on my head,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4406,Helmets in climbing,2,15,i don't wear one on small top rope crags~ even here a club member had a head injury from a tumble while coming back down so perhaps i'm illogical,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4407,Helmets in climbing,2,15,presumably there are potential dangers: indoor walls ban them presumably due to risk of catching on bolts or being somehow dropped on other customers,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,
4408,Helmets in climbing,2,15,its like car seat belts: a common reason given for not wearing them was that one could be burnt to death if they failed to release,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,0,
4409,Helmets in climbing,2,15,doubtless that's happened somewhere~ but a tremendous number of serious injuries must have been prevented since belts became compulsory in the uk.,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1,1,

4461,Helmets in climbing,3,9,it only weighs 30g more than the non-mips version~ and doesn't add any noticeable bulk,Apr 2017,Jun 14 2020,0,1,
4462,Helmets in climbing,3,9,"it's basically a very thin web of plastic that provides isolation for the mounting points between the shell of the helmet and the ""harness"" that secures to your head",Apr 2017,Jun 14 2020,0,1,

4465,Helmets in climbing,3,9,are there any kids helmets with mips? i don't have kids~ but i would guess that even small adult helmets don't fit them~ and their brains are pretty important.,Apr 2017,Jun 14 2020,0,1,
4466,Helmets in climbing,3,10,i don't wear tape when crack climbing because chicks dig scars and i don't wear a helmet because chicks love vegetables!,Sep 2018,Jun 14 2020,1,1,
4467,Helmets in climbing,3,12,petzl boreo is plenty light~ and extremely comfortable~ and you dont have to replace it every year because it wont get dinged up like an all foam helmet,Sep 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,2,
4468,Helmets in climbing,3,12,i personally don't trust the ultralight foam helmets to protect against a major impact~ when you need it most.,Sep 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
4469,Helmets in climbing,3,13,"an ""interesting"" thread",Nov 2009,Jun 15 2020,7,1,
4470,Helmets in climbing,3,13,lots of people talking to themselves (a typical internet phenomenon) and the real world not bothering to get involved,Nov 2009,Jun 15 2020,7,1,
4471,Helmets in climbing,3,13,i saw maybe 250 climbers in action over the weekend and not one was wearing a helmet~ buddy checks didn't exist and grigris where the device of choice.,Nov 2009,Jun 15 2020,7,1,
4472,Helmets in climbing,3,14,condescending remarks seem to be a typical internet phenomenon~ as well,Sep 2017,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4473,Helmets in climbing,3,14,seems like theres quite a few people talking to each other on this thread~ and hopefully we'll talk to people in the real world about it at some point in our life,Sep 2017,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4474,Helmets in climbing,3,14,meanwhile~ in america~ i saw at least 5 people wearing a helmet on sunday while climbing.,Sep 2017,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4475,Helmets in climbing,3,15,"i'm guessing the kind of person who would engage in a thread on this forum about helmets would tend to be someone who has a strong opinion about helmets~ therefore we get a bunch of people saying ""i always wear a helmet"" while 90% of sport climbers never bat an eye (or put on a helmet).",Sep 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4476,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i'm one of the people who rarely wears a helmet for 1-pitch sport climbing,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4477,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i also rarely wear it when toproping~ top-rope soloing~ bouldering~ soloing~ or belaying at the base of a crag,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4478,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i typically wear one for multipitch~ most 1-pitch trad climbs~ and mtn biking,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4479,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i know it would be safer for me to wear one all the time~ and i have not experienced my lightweight foam helmet adversely affecting my sending ability,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,0,
4480,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i've seen first-hand 2 partners who are alive probably because they were wearing helmets when they fell on a multipitch trad lead,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4481,Helmets in climbing,3,16,"i'll genuinely try to look at this and question ""why do i choose to sometimes and not others?""",Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4482,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i suppose i wear it primarily because i am more concerned about something getting dropped on me,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4483,Helmets in climbing,3,16,"(when i'm belaying at a crag~ i'm under the illusion that i can stay out of the line of fire~ for the most part.)  it's nice to also have that extra level of safety when there is more likelihood for bigger falls (i.e.~ trad climbing-- especially during the first handful of years when you are still less reliably placing and trusting bomber gear-- although i feel more solid with gear now~ perhaps the habit of wearing one kind of remains for me~ even on a ""safe"" creek hands splitter)",Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4484,Helmets in climbing,3,16,"sport climbs~ by definition~ are intended to allow for ""safe"" falls and i still generally foolishly trust that-- despite having witnessed/experienced that some sport climbs are poorly bolted~ weird falls are always possible~ and that falling before or while clipping the 2nd or 3rd bolt could sometimes result in a ground fall.what would get me to wear one almost all the time? sadly~ it would probably be either (a) seeing or experiencing something bad~ or (b) seeing a majority of climbing magazine photos/vids of (typically top-level) sport climbers wearing and advocating for them~ and the strongest climbers in my area wearing them",Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4485,Helmets in climbing,3,16,i hate to argue with those of you who say you should always wear one (on this site or out at the crag)~ because i know that you are right and that my rationale is inconsistent,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4486,Helmets in climbing,3,16,not to defend myself~ but it's worth noting that my risk tolerance may be a bit higher than it is for some (i do enjoy trad climbing~ and climbing in the mountains~ etc.)~ and i started at a time when helmets were less commonly used than they are now (~20 years ago),Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4487,Helmets in climbing,3,16,thanks for the posts~ reading these perspectives and about the accidents does cause me to reconsider and be more likely to wear a helmet more often~ without a doubt.,Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3,1,
4488,Helmets in climbing,3,17,thanks george; super refreshing to hear a highly competent and strong climber admit this,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4489,Helmets in climbing,3,17,we like to think we aren't influenced by other climbers~ but we all are,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4490,Helmets in climbing,3,17,these two reasons are why i wear one,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4491,Helmets in climbing,3,17,i  saw some people wear one at the crag once~ i assumed they were gumbies~ and then they crushed very hard~ and i realized i needed to check my assumptions,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4492,Helmets in climbing,3,17,then~ about a month later my wife took a huge surprise whip (clipping hold broke) that could have seriously fucked her up if she had had her leg behind the rope accidentally while casually clipping the chains,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4493,Helmets in climbing,3,17,those two experiences together changed my habits.,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
4494,Helmets in climbing,3,18,one time i was belaying and there was a climber on a route 15 or 20 feet to my right,Apr 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
4495,Helmets in climbing,3,18,they pulled off a baseball sized rock that flew sideways right towards my head,Apr 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
4496,Helmets in climbing,3,18,i was able to react enough to move my head but it did hit my right upper trapezius muscle,Apr 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
4497,Helmets in climbing,3,18,it just bounced off and didn't even leave a bruise so i was pretty lucky,Apr 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
4498,Helmets in climbing,3,18,i was not wearing a helmet and i still don't when belaying (unless the wall is very chossy~ but then why would i be climbing there?).,Apr 2017,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
4499,Helmets in climbing,3,19,i wear a helmet 100% of time outdoors on ropes climbing and belaying,Nov 2019,Jun 17 2020,0,1,
4500,Helmets in climbing,3,19,i come from a mountain biking background~ so its just natural,Nov 2019,Jun 17 2020,0,1,
4501,Helmets in climbing,3,19,i have to say that some rock climbing helmets are really ugly~ imho.,Nov 2019,Jun 17 2020,0,1,
4502,Helmets in climbing,4,0,i feel like i’m falling victim to some pervasive conspiracy promoted by “big helmet”....i only have one head~ never heard of~ or needed helmets as a kid growing up~ and yet now i have over a dozen helmets just for me (climbing~ biking~ whitewater~ snow sports~ parachuting~ motorcycle~ etc)  add in my whole family~ and i need a separate garage for helmets alone,Jun 2013,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4503,Helmets in climbing,4,0,time to combine into one,Jun 2013,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4504,Helmets in climbing,4,0,probably based on a bike helmet.,Jun 2013,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4505,Helmets in climbing,4,1,about 30 years ago i read an article in one of the climbing magazines about helmets and tbis,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4506,Helmets in climbing,4,1,up to that time i had not thought about a helmet for climbing but the article made sense to me so i went out to buy one,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4507,Helmets in climbing,4,1,none of the climbing helmets fit my head right but i found a kayaking helmet that was comfortable so i bought that,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4508,Helmets in climbing,4,1,following weekend~ i went to the valley with a partner,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4509,Helmets in climbing,4,1,got to the base of the first route of the day and realized i had left the new helmet in the car,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4510,Helmets in climbing,4,1,rationalized: “well~ i’ve already climbed 10 years without needing a helmet~ one more day won’t hurt”,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4511,Helmets in climbing,4,1,ten minutes later i proceeded to take a 40 foot pretty clean fall that at some point flipped me front to back so that at the end of the fall the back of my head upper shoulder smacked against a protrusion on the face,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4512,Helmets in climbing,4,1,when my partner called up to ask if i was ok~ i thought my arm was broken because i couldn’t feel it or move it,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4513,Helmets in climbing,4,1,by the time he lowered me to the ground the feeling was coming back into my arm but i could tell i had hit my head hard,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4514,Helmets in climbing,4,1,it was bad enough i thought it might result in my dying.  the drive to the valley clinic~ jack was asking me questions about who was president etc,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4515,Helmets in climbing,4,1,but ali i could do was say~ jack~ please tell michael how sorry i am and how much i love him,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4516,Helmets in climbing,4,1,please tell my family i was thinking about them before i died.  well i lived~ with a bad concussion and some nerve damage into my arm that took a while to resolve,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4517,Helmets in climbing,4,1,i’ve never forgotten the helmet again,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,2,
4518,Helmets in climbing,4,1,i personally feel like it’s an important piece of gear,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4519,Helmets in climbing,4,1,it has gotten whacked since then in various scenarios and replaced a couple of times,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4520,Helmets in climbing,4,1,i’m so used to wearing it that i’ll often forget to take it off for the hike out.,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6,1,
4521,Helmets in climbing,4,2,i wear my helmet out at the end of the day probably 30% of the time,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4522,Helmets in climbing,4,2,one evening~ at the end of a day where i had been by myself all day~ in a relatively remote area~ i thoughtlessly put my helmet on~ and on the way out~ at the sketchiest part of the trail~ i raised up into a leg sized branch on a tree and absolutely pile drived myself,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4523,Helmets in climbing,4,2,it was so hard of an impact that i saw stars for a minute or so~ and i knew that if i'd been without my helmet on~ it would have knocked me out for sure,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4524,Helmets in climbing,4,2,the worst~ if i would have fallen down there~ there's a solid chance i would have died,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4525,Helmets in climbing,4,2,moral of the story: dont leave giant limbs hanging over your trail that can knock you out! and wear your helmet out if there's difficult terrain still left.,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4526,Helmets in climbing,4,3,i seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when i'm wearing the helmet,Aug 2011,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4527,Helmets in climbing,4,3,i think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head.,Aug 2011,Jun 18 2020,4,1,
4528,Helmets in climbing,4,4,i seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when i'm wearing the helmet,Apr 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4529,Helmets in climbing,4,4,i think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head,Apr 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4530,Helmets in climbing,4,4,i suspect that has at least as much~ if not more~ to do with the “boundaries” of your head having suddenly changed...kinda like a kid stubbing their toe a bunch when they are growing.,Apr 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4531,Helmets in climbing,4,5,i seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when i'm wearing the helmet,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4532,Helmets in climbing,4,5,i think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4533,Helmets in climbing,4,5,you're right,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4534,Helmets in climbing,4,5,there's a good chance i would have seen it without a helmet~ but i was insanely tired and who knows if i would have been paying attention more or not~ but ramming the top of my head during the step up would have been very bad,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4535,Helmets in climbing,4,5,ultimately i just got lucky,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4536,Helmets in climbing,4,5,that branch~ not so lucky.,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4537,Helmets in climbing,4,6,i seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when i'm wearing the helmet,Apr 2015,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4538,Helmets in climbing,4,6,i think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head,Apr 2015,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4539,Helmets in climbing,4,6,"yeah me too~ but its probably proprioception~ i can't see my helmet in my ""peripheral"" or maybe the fact that your hair can act like a feeler to warn you before you bonk your head~ either way when i bonk my head with a helmet it doesn't hurt so no harm done~ rather have the occasional~ clunk oh yeah helmet than get hit in the head.",Apr 2015,Jun 18 2020,1,1,
4540,Helmets in climbing,4,7,"yeah me too~ but its probably proprioception~ i can't see my helmet in my ""peripheral"" or maybe the fact that your hair can act like a feeler to warn you",Jun 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4541,Helmets in climbing,4,7,i’m exact opposite,Jun 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4542,Helmets in climbing,4,7,my trouble now isn’t proprioception~ it’s priapism from past head injuries,Jun 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4543,Helmets in climbing,4,7,need to rely on peripheral vision as my forward vision is blocked,Jun 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4544,Helmets in climbing,4,7,can act like a feeler though ( to the alarm of other trail users),Jun 2020,Jun 18 2020,2,1,
4545,Helmets in climbing,4,8,i wear a helmet because why the fuck not? it’s pretty comfortable compared to head injury,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5,1,
4546,Helmets in climbing,4,8,on one of my very first outdoor climbing experiences~ a fist sized rock missed my head by mere centimeters,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5,1,
4547,Helmets in climbing,4,8,i wear a helmet on all roped climbs now.  the most memorable was when our group of four had just finished a climb and were packing up though we were still 20ft up on a scramble,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5,1,
4548,Helmets in climbing,4,8,everyone else had taken their helmets off aside from me and we joked and made a comment on how everyone else should still keep them on,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5,1,
4549,Helmets in climbing,4,8,i shit you not~ ten seconds later~ i took a rock to my helmet,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5,1,

4551,Helmets in climbing,4,8,he went home and bought a helmet,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5,1,

5504,BD solution for big walling,1,14,as a replacement i bought the solution guide (mostly for the bigger gear loops)~ and i've been using it for a handful of months now,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,2,
5505,BD solution for big walling,1,14,the belay loop is diferent and the tie in points were covered in an outer layer/material on the original solution~ but not on the guide,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5506,BD solution for big walling,1,14,i do a shitload of whipping and i really don't think that's it,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5507,BD solution for big walling,1,14,i'm primarily a sport climber,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5508,BD solution for big walling,1,14,i did wear through the outer material/layer on the original solution.  wearing the guide without a shirt is more uncomfortable than my original because they changed the inner mesh/lining on and it's rougher on my skin,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5509,BD solution for big walling,1,14,also~ the new guide has some exposed webbing on the leg loops where the old solution has the webbing covered by the outer material~ which i liked,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5510,BD solution for big walling,1,14,i don't think it'll be an issue~ but i did wear through that outer material on my old solution so we'll see how the webbing on the guide leg loops holds up,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5511,BD solution for big walling,1,14,all in all~ i'd agree - the guide is a step forward and a step back at the same time for a solid step sideways,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5512,BD solution for big walling,1,14,if it wasn't for the larger front loops i'd probably get the standard solution.,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0,1,
5513,BD solution for big walling,1,15,i've put over 100 pitches (with plenty of granite and sandstone ow/chimney) on mine and it still looks brand new...not sure what the hell the other guy's doing to shred his tie in points.  yeah i will admit that i did a lot of sport climbing in the guide~ but my point remains~ why would they intentionally slim down the tie in points while beefing up the rest of the harness? makes no sense to me~ as they clearly weren't trying to make an ultralight harness,Nov 2013,Jun 30 2020,1,1,

5536,What would you do in this situation,1,0,situation: you are double rope rapping with a 8.4 tag line and a 9.0 lead line,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5537,What would you do in this situation,1,0,we are single rope rapping off the 9.0 since we both have gri gris,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5538,What would you do in this situation,1,0,the rap stations are equipped with standard rap rings,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5539,What would you do in this situation,1,0,you tie the ropes together with a standard overhand knot and you realize that the knot of these two small diameters ropes is pretty small and looks like it could be pulled through the rap rings with enough force,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,2,
5540,What would you do in this situation,1,0,you retie with a figure 8 and then try a fisherman's as well and both those look small enough to pull through,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5541,What would you do in this situation,1,0,at least small enough to make you nervous,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5542,What would you do in this situation,1,0,what would you do? here is what we did (but i am looking for other opinions) we put the tag line on belay for the first rapper to prevent it from pulling through,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5543,What would you do in this situation,1,0,then when first rapper was down at the next station~ they put the tag line on belay (fixed it) for the second rapper,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5544,What would you do in this situation,1,0,what would have been our other options? (edit: to add the detail of single rope rapping off gri gris),Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5545,What would you do in this situation,1,1,were you concerned that it would be pulled through somehow during the rap? i do a lot of multipitch climbing on a pair of 8.1’s~ and i’m pretty sure that a flat overhand on them could fit through a rap ring if you really try,Oct 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,1,
5546,What would you do in this situation,1,1,it has never been an issue,Oct 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,1,
5547,What would you do in this situation,1,1,edit: the single-rope grigri rap is a completely different thing~ you are absolutely right to be concerned,Oct 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,0,
5548,What would you do in this situation,1,1,biner block.,Oct 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,1,
5549,What would you do in this situation,1,2,it is the op’s rope diameter difference that raises the question,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5550,What would you do in this situation,1,2,edit: well~ i was wrong,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5551,What would you do in this situation,1,2,the fatter rope typically creates more friction running through the rap device,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,0,
5552,What would you do in this situation,1,2,this leads to the fatter rope being pulled on with more of the rappellers weight,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5553,What would you do in this situation,1,2,and that tends to cause the ropes to run through the anchor leading to fatally uneven rope ends.,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
5554,What would you do in this situation,1,3,my main concern was having the knot being pulled through the rap rings because it was such a small knot being created by two skinny ropes,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,0,0,
5555,What would you do in this situation,1,3,another detail i left out that is important.,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,0,2,
5556,What would you do in this situation,1,3,we were single rope rapping on the 9.0 since we both had gri gris.,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,0,1,
5557,What would you do in this situation,1,4,i don’t think this poses much of an issue~ the flat overhand should be fine for the situation,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,0,1,
5558,What would you do in this situation,1,4,if you are nervous about the thicker rope being tugged down~ just make sure to tie solid stopper knots at the ends of both ropes~ or tie the two ropes together at the bottom as well~ creating a closed loop,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,0,2,
5559,What would you do in this situation,1,4,*this was posted before he specified that he was doing single strand rappels with a grigri,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,0,0,
5560,What would you do in this situation,1,4,once he clarified that~ i made another comment recommending a biner block which you can find below this one.*,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,0,1,
5561,What would you do in this situation,1,5,i’d use a flat overhand to tie the ropes together~ close the system~ usually by putting knots in the ends of my ropes~ and rap without worrying,Mar 2012,Jun 22 2020,3,1,
5562,What would you do in this situation,1,5,edit: rapping on a single strand is a big detail to originally leave out! tying a blocking knot on the backside of the rings and clipping it back to the rap line is usually my preferred method of adding security.,Mar 2012,Jun 22 2020,3,1,
5563,What would you do in this situation,1,6,you replied as i was typing mine! in that case~ you can incorporate a carabiner where you join the two ropes~ on the tag line side of the rap rings,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,5,1,
5564,What would you do in this situation,1,6,it should be a big enough block to prevent the knot from sliding through.,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,5,1,
5565,What would you do in this situation,1,7,that's a big detail haha,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,1,
5566,What would you do in this situation,1,7,otherwise the knot pulling through wouldn't be an issue with a plaquette/tube device,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,0,
5567,What would you do in this situation,1,7,in this situation you would use a biner block and use the skinny rope as a tagline.,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,4,1,
5568,What would you do in this situation,1,9,a pretty big detail to leave out! carabiner block so you can pull the tag line,Aug 2019,Jun 22 2020,11,1,
5569,What would you do in this situation,1,9,very simple and maybe you should evaluate your systems before you go further,Aug 2019,Jun 22 2020,11,1,
5570,What would you do in this situation,1,9,this is very basic and should be a no-brainer,Aug 2019,Jun 22 2020,11,1,
5571,What would you do in this situation,1,9,(or 0/10).,Aug 2019,Jun 22 2020,11,1,
5572,What would you do in this situation,1,10,i think in this situation where the concern is the knot being small~ it would be better to mitigate that by putting the biner block on the rap rope and not on the tagline,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,8,1,
5573,What would you do in this situation,1,10,as demonstrated here: youtu.be/dlkpq_0f6ai,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,8,1,
5574,What would you do in this situation,1,11,i don't do raps on single lines~ even more so on climbing rope and tag line combo.,Feb 2012,Jun 22 2020,4,1,

5585,What would you do in this situation,1,15,"the above comment was obviously issued before the original post was edited to indicate the party was single-rope rapping on the 9mm and using the 8.1 as a true ""tag line""",Aug 2013,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
5586,What would you do in this situation,1,15,"with a 9.0mm and an 8.1 and both running through my atc-type-device i would not worry about either creep or knot-through as long at the 9mm went through the ring and the knot was tied on the ""8.1 mm side""",Aug 2013,Jun 22 2020,2,0,
5587,What would you do in this situation,1,15,"however~ with zero weight on the 8.1 i would be concerned~ especially if there were places where you had to ""jump and stop"" like going over an overhang into free space",Aug 2013,Jun 22 2020,2,1,

5589,What would you do in this situation,1,16,however a locker is incorporated~ just be aware that there are various new ways to wind up with a stuck rap rope or other issues: a) cloved locker with i-beam profile stuck during pull at lip of rap ledge; b) locker snag on ‘minor’ shrub during pull when tag line runs down one side of shrub and primary rope runs down the other,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,3,1,

5634,What would you do in this situation,2,7,then the rope is stuck.  rather~ join the ropes with any sensible knot,Oct 2013,Jun 22 2020,3,1,
5635,What would you do in this situation,2,7,clove the main rope just before the knot to the locker,Oct 2013,Jun 22 2020,3,1,
5636,What would you do in this situation,2,7,clip locker to main rope as in images above.,Oct 2013,Jun 22 2020,3,1,
5637,What would you do in this situation,2,8,just found this useful pagehttps://people.bath.ac.uk/dac33/high/10gettingbackdown.htm#abseilingwithasingleapulllineoragrigri looks like a useful website for the op,Oct 2013,Jun 22 2020,0,1,
5638,What would you do in this situation,2,10,another option: lower your partner to the next anchor~ they tie the tag line to their harness to anchor that strand for your rappel on the main line.,Jun 2006,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
5639,What would you do in this situation,2,11,it's reepschnur and it may not be the best solution because one cannot use this method to rappel at stations with large rings or carabiners~ or on alpine routes where webbing is used without rings. which sound likes what the op is describing,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5640,What would you do in this situation,2,11,wait,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5641,What would you do in this situation,2,11,what?  you quoted me because i mispelled it?  but~ got it right phonetically?,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5642,What would you do in this situation,2,12,think it through,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5643,What would you do in this situation,2,12,for the first one down i'd probably just tie it all off (double-strand slip knot and carabiner back to the anchor) or clove hitch a blocking carabiner back to the thicker rope (why? second is there to attend it),Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5644,What would you do in this situation,2,12,second removes all that,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5645,What would you do in this situation,2,12,for the second~ i'd have the first one down tension up a few metres and tie the skinnier rope to something (themself~ if nothing else~ but there's an anchor~ right?),Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5646,What would you do in this situation,2,12,but~ most probably~ we'd neither of us be using a bloody grigri in this situation,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,

5649,What would you do in this situation,2,13,if the only belay device i had was a grigri? munter.  if i’m not allowed to munter for some reason? biner block,Apr 2010,Jun 29 2020,2,1,
5650,What would you do in this situation,2,14,as an amendment of that image (assuming that op's fears are valid) you would be better suited to switch the order of the top and bottom knots (fig 8 & edk) - the edk can get sucked into and stuck in the rings before the fig 8 and the biner block engage,Mar 2014,Jun 29 2020,2,1,
5651,What would you do in this situation,2,14,not good for the pull!  it would be better to have the fig 8 biner block on the rap line engage with the rings and to have the edk behind it - attaching the pull line.,Mar 2014,Jun 29 2020,2,1,
5652,What would you do in this situation,2,15,tying ropes together with two rethreaded figure-8s is good,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,

5655,What would you do in this situation,2,15,fine~ until you pull the ropes,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5656,What would you do in this situation,2,15,the flemish bend is a sexy symmetrical knot but less likely to roll over obstructions (edges)~ more likely to work in and get stuck (cracks),Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5657,What would you do in this situation,2,15,not as likely as a bulky double fisherman's~ but stuck is stuck,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5658,What would you do in this situation,2,15,use a double-strand overhand~ ie the edk (euro death knot) and it will roll over obstructions rather more reliably when pulled~ because it is not symmetrical.,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0,0,
5659,What would you do in this situation,2,16,hmm.,Mar 2014,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5660,What would you do in this situation,2,16,this just gave me pause for those weird rap stations with mussy hooks (such as in pine creek canyon) and the reepschnuur biner block method,Mar 2014,Jun 29 2020,0,1,

5672,What would you do in this situation,2,19,it is the op’s rope diameter difference that raises the question,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5673,What would you do in this situation,2,19,edit: well~ i was wrong,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5674,What would you do in this situation,2,19,the fatter rope typically creates more friction running through the rap device,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,0,
5675,What would you do in this situation,2,19,this leads to the fatter rope being pulled on with more of the rappellers weight,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5676,What would you do in this situation,2,19,and that tends to cause the ropes to run through the anchor leading to fatally uneven rope ends,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5677,What would you do in this situation,2,19,bill or mp~ how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block?,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5678,What would you do in this situation,3,0,have the person doing the double rope rap pre-rig their device,Feb 2011,Jun 29 2020,2,1,
5679,What would you do in this situation,3,0,this prevents the rope from moving through the rings the gri gri owners can then rap without worrying about the rope moving,Feb 2011,Jun 29 2020,2,0,
5680,What would you do in this situation,3,0,then they tend the ends (especially the tag line) to ensure the rope movement isn’t an issue.,Feb 2011,Jun 29 2020,2,1,
5681,What would you do in this situation,3,1,wait,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5682,What would you do in this situation,3,1,what?  you quoted me because i mispelled it?  but~ got it right phonetically?  shoot me,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5683,What would you do in this situation,3,1,you can do better.  i quoted you not because you misspelled it,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5684,What would you do in this situation,3,1,i corrected the spelling was so others would know the correct name so to learn about it.  however~ and more importantly~ the goal the reepschnur is make it safe to rappel on a single line,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5685,What would you do in this situation,3,1,that will work regardless what it is threaded through,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5686,What would you do in this situation,3,1,"(if ya want to gripe i should have uses the term ""should not"" instead of ""cannot"")",Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5687,What would you do in this situation,3,1,but one also does not want the knot to get flipped over to the weighted side which was part of what the op described,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5688,What would you do in this situation,3,1,if used with large rings or caribiners or on alpine routes where webbing is used without rings the knot can get flipped over to the weighted side,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5689,What would you do in this situation,3,1,thus making it pretty much impossible to pull the rope,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5690,What would you do in this situation,3,1,so no it was not the reepschnur for the win.,Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5691,What would you do in this situation,3,2,not to hijack the thread~ but what do people think about this rappel setup: i'm rapping on a grigri (just visible) against a stopper knot (a super 8 in this case) with a biner for insurance,Oct 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5692,What would you do in this situation,3,2,the super 8 had previously been used on the musseys (with backup draws on each) and i didn't feel like untying it and retying a normal stopper,Oct 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,0,
5693,What would you do in this situation,3,2,but my concern here is that i'm rapping against musseys whose lateral strength against their spring gates may not be very high,Oct 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5694,What would you do in this situation,3,2,i wouldn't want to bend/break the gates (although i think i'm not going to die since the backup biner will  hold in any case).,Oct 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5695,What would you do in this situation,3,3,bill or mp~ how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block?  do you mean while rapping with both strands through~ say~ an atc?,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5696,What would you do in this situation,3,4,double fishermans will solve this problem,Jun 2014,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5697,What would you do in this situation,3,5,i really wonder how often this has happened,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5698,What would you do in this situation,3,5,it would be easily discovered by the second rapper while the first rapper is descending,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5699,What would you do in this situation,3,5,then~ the first one down can provide a little bit of tension on the tag line to mitigate,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5700,What would you do in this situation,3,5,if communication with the first one down is not an option~ just put both strands in brake hand while rapping,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5701,What would you do in this situation,3,5,pretty simple,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5702,What would you do in this situation,3,5,common sense for the win.   personally~ i prefer the reepschur since the overhand on a bight  (not eight) that i use has a flat side much like the edk making pulls a bit easier,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5703,What would you do in this situation,3,5,an eight on a bight has a flat side too,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5704,What would you do in this situation,3,5,bit has more bulk than the overhand and provides no additional security in this case.,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,
5705,What would you do in this situation,3,6,munter (no extension~ may need double munter on really skinny ropes~ ) or biner brake belay the first down~ fireman the last (if you are new or trying something new~ are tired or otherwise distracted~ or anytime you have lots of time) close the system with knot at the bottom auto block friggin grigri's,Dec 2019,Jun 29 2020,1,0,
5706,What would you do in this situation,3,7,do you mean while rapping with both strands through~ say~ an atc? yes,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0,1,
5707,What would you do in this situation,3,8,bill or mp~ how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block?  i have never had a problem with rope creep~ and i think it is more a theoretical thing that can happen,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
5708,What would you do in this situation,3,8,i've extensively used a 7mm tag/trail line and rarely set it up as a biner block~ i just double rope rap with it using an atc,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
5709,What would you do in this situation,3,8,i've had it for a very long time and have paired it with anything from 8.9-10+mm and have never had an issue,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4,2,
5710,What would you do in this situation,3,8,i cut it at about 65m to pair with 60m ropes for a little extra safety,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
5711,What would you do in this situation,3,8,maybe 1-2 feet of slippage due to one being static and the other dynamic - bouncing,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
5712,What would you do in this situation,3,8,if the pull is clean~ i don't even care what side the knot is on.,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4,1,
5713,What would you do in this situation,3,9,i have never had a problem with rope creep~ and i think it is more a theoretical thing that can happen.  i’ve seen rope creep: 6 mm tag line & ~10 mm rope.,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1,1,

5724,What would you do in this situation,3,15,the only reason i kept reading after page one was to make sure someone had said this at some point along the way,Jan 2006,Jun 30 2020,2,1,
5725,What would you do in this situation,3,15,needed saying.,Jan 2006,Jun 30 2020,2,1,

5727,What would you do in this situation,3,16,though it' probably not the safest thing to do,Nov 2007,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
5728,What would you do in this situation,3,16,i set it up this way after leading sometimes in case i wanna do a subsequent tr lap; if not i can just pull the rope and move on,Nov 2007,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
5729,What would you do in this situation,3,16,the knot seems to jam mostly against the hook part of the mussy rather than the gate,Nov 2007,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
5730,What would you do in this situation,3,16,i'd be more concerned about the rope accidentally unclipping rather than breaking a gate~ though i'd imagine either is possible.,Nov 2007,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
5731,What would you do in this situation,3,17,i’ve seen rope creep: 6 mm tag line & ~10 mm rope,Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
5732,What would you do in this situation,3,17,yeah~ there can be a little bit or rope slip~ but it is not the big deal folks make it out to be and it is easy to manage by adjusting the tension in your break hand to allow the ropes to flow through evenly~ keeping an eye on things and giving a little extra slack on the fat rope~ etc.certainly not a phenomemon that needs a solution beyond normal rapping practices (knots~ wathing then ends...),Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,1,1,
5733,What would you do in this situation,3,18,yes~ but then the multipitching grigri people will have a problem and still won't know how to get down (or up),Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,1,0,
5734,What would you do in this situation,3,18,i guess you could go with 8.5mm and above and each carry 2 grigris for belaying...,Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,1,1,

5738,What would you do in this situation,3,19,belay with the gri gri on one dual rated rope and on descent~ the first rapper uses the gg to descend on a fixed rope~ the second pulls the knot~ to re-establish traditional rappel and uses the tube.,Jun 2013,Jun 30 2020,1,1,

6371,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,3,3,"i'm just going to go back to saying ""tight"" or ""tipped out"" because coming from the world building racing engines (dealing with camshafts) the way climbers seem to have interpreted ""camming action"" so strangely and no one is going to bother reading this :)  a ""cam"" is ""a projection on a rotating part in machinery""",Jan 2015,Jun 11 2019,8,1,

6394,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,3,10,5.6 climber chiming in seems the only way these will fill the c3 hole is if the narrower side of the lobes are as narrow as the single lobe on the equivalent c3 which kinda graduates in width if i recall correctly,Dec 2014,Jun 11 2019,1,1,

6505,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,14,they don’t have to be a thinned down lobe~ they could have offset the rotation on a single axle just like they did on the .3 x4 and it would be a tank.,Jan 2015,Jun 30 2019,2,1,
6506,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,15,jrzane missed the point~ they don’t have to be a design more likely to deform,Dec 2015,Jun 30 2019,2,1,

6510,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,16,along the lines of discussion with the x4s...i've always heard that the offset axle design of the .3 and below caused catastrophic failures in soft rock (windgate),Feb 2014,Jun 30 2019,0,1,
6511,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,16,i've led myself to believe to never place .3 and smaller x4s in windgate,Feb 2014,Jun 30 2019,0,1,

6514,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,17,c3s may be great when placing them~ but ive read lots of stories of them being so rigid that they popped out when loaded,Aug 2009,Jun 30 2019,2,0,
6515,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,17,the point of a placement is not for it to go in easily~ it’s for it to hold the force of the fall (or body weight in an aid placement),Aug 2009,Jun 30 2019,2,1,
6516,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,17,i think this is why the z4s look cool because they are the head width of the c3s but have the flexibility and don’t place other weird forces where the lobes touch the rock.,Aug 2009,Jun 30 2019,2,2,
6517,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,19,fair enough i can’t seem to find the accounts of failure that i had when i was researching to buy new small cams (metolius u stem power cams were the standard when i started trad climbing and i dont really have the $$ to upgrade when new stuff comes out) there are more comments about folks who love the c3s than those who hate them so i guess i just saw a few negative comments that put me off,Aug 2009,Jun 30 2019,0,1,

6728,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,7,what many people don't understand is that metal is flexible and can be compressed~ so when you put a force on small metal parts (the axle and the lobes of the cam) you bend the axle and compress the lobes of the cam,Aug 2010,Jul 12 2019,8,1,

7007,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,18,however~ the problem is that the opposing pressure of the thumb against the thumb loop and fingers pulling down on the trigger inherently stabilizes the stem of any cam~ so imo not much about bd’s technology is really being shown through those pictures,Apr 2019,Jan 27 2020,0,1,

7017,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,6,1,emasculated mastercam and alien :(   interesting! i would also wonder if the z4 is simply stiffer to begin with than the mastercam and the alien~ which would account for the lack of bending~ as opposed to the rigidflex tech,Apr 2019,Jan 27 2020,2,2,
7018,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,6,1,for example~ i think that the mastercam is stiffer than the alien~ and it appears to bend at a less severe angle~ so perhaps the z4 is stiffer than the mastercam,Apr 2019,Jan 27 2020,2,1,

7279,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,7,personally i think the nicest thing about them is the head width,Apr 2019,Feb 8 2020,1,2,
7280,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,7,my .5 z4 has a narrower head than my yellow dragonfly (.2 equivalent).,Apr 2019,Feb 8 2020,1,1,
7281,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,8,i placed a .1 z4 today and it felt bomber,Sep 2017,Feb 8 2020,4,1,
7282,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,8,i wasnt overly happy with the way the trigger felt at first~ especially compared to an ul master~ but no big deal,Sep 2017,Feb 8 2020,4,0,

7291,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,10,another benefit that i like is that the z4 0.3 (blue) size is double-axle~ where the x4 0.3 had a single (though offset) axle if the crack is inwardly flaring (which are oddly common on this multipitch route i'm currently developing) the cam can walk back into the crack and then will only hold if it's rated for a passive placement.,Oct 2017,Feb 9 2020,3,1,

7299,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,16,outside of the two lobe thing (which totem only suggests for aid placements)~ how is a totem better for offset placements?  the advantage of the offset is that is has two different sized cam sets to fit into a flaring or irregular crack,Jun 2016,Feb 10 2020,2,2,
7300,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,16,the totem doesn't have that so how is it compensating?,Jun 2016,Feb 10 2020,2,1,

7302,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,17,the totem doesn't have that so how is it compensating? totems main advantage is that each side is loaded directly~ as opposed to every other cam on the market which loads the stem~ which in turn loads the two sides together,Sep 2017,Feb 10 2020,6,1,
7303,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,17,so~ the independent loading of the two different sides means that an offset placement will be as equally bomber as parallel placements,Sep 2017,Feb 10 2020,6,1,
7304,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,17,this is the patent that every cam manufacturer will jump on once it expires,Sep 2017,Feb 10 2020,6,1,

7307,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,18,the totem doesn't have that so how is it compensating? you need to either take a totem in hand and play with it and compare it to regular off sets or google for videos showing how they work for off sets,Apr 2012,Feb 10 2020,5,1,
7308,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,18,i’ve got sets of alien~ metolious and x4 off sets and 9 times out of 10 i’ll choose the totem for a flared or off set placement,Apr 2012,Feb 10 2020,5,1,
7309,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,19,each pair of cam lobes is independent from the other set,Mar 2016,Feb 10 2020,1,1,
7310,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,19,on the same principle as using a two-lobe aid placement,Mar 2016,Feb 10 2020,1,1,
7311,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,19,so one set of lobes in a flare and one set in something more uniform means something much closer to a solid placement than something like a c4 where any of the lobes in a flare compromise the entire placement,Mar 2016,Feb 10 2020,1,1,
7312,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,19,tldr: because the cams don’t have to be placed all uniform for the thing to work edit: so you can have one set of lobes basically cammed all the way and the other set tipped out and it’s still a decent piece of gear,Mar 2016,Feb 10 2020,1,2,

7400,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,13,something i noticed: one way bd got that narrow head width was to shave the width off of the individual lobes of the z4’s,Jun 2001,Feb 18 2020,7,1,
7401,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,13,if you compare the z4 lobes to the x4 lobes~ there is less surface area in contact with the rock,Jun 2001,Feb 18 2020,7,1,

7941,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,the cable stiffener on the z4's is only really effective when the cam lobes are 100% retracted,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7942,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,the stiffening effect is easily observable in the smallest sizes because the trigger barely travels before it hits 100%,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,2,
7943,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,with the larger z4's you need to mentally remind your yourself to bottom-out the trigger if you want the stiffness,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7944,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,this is why people are saying the cable stiffener does nothing~ they need to pull the trigger in farther,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7945,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,the z4's only stiffen on a single axis (vertically in a normal placement) and the stiffener has no effect on the side to side axis in a normal placement,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,0,

7947,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,the cable stiffener is a good idea~ the implementation on the z4 is okay~ far from great,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7948,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,overall though~ these still seem like very nice cams at a great value price point,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,2,
7949,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,the .5 & .75 are the gems of the series,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7950,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,these two sizes shine because of the dual-axle range~ narrow headwidth~ diminutive weight and size~ and the cheap msrp.  .3 & .4 are marvels of engineering to behold,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7951,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,however~ the totems that overlap these sizes are better cams,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7952,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,double butt~ with a good sale you could buy a 0.3 & a 0.4 z4 for the price of a single totem,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,

7956,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,if there wasn't the single/dual axle debate (and totems) these would be right there with the .75 & .5 as the gems of the line.  0~ .1~ and .2 z4's are good but not noticeably better than ul mastercams~ dragonfly's~ aliens~ c3's etc i think the z4 add more of the same to this category~ which isn't bad but isn't exciting either,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,
7957,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11,the z4's are an upgrade from x4's because of headwidth,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14,1,

7963,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,12,i'm less impressed with the smallest sizes; the trigger pull of the ultralight mastercams is nicer,Mar 2012,May 18 2020,12,2,
7964,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,12,it's worth noting that the 0.3 and 0.4 fit slightly smaller placements than their c4 brethren by perhaps a quarter of a size,Mar 2012,May 18 2020,12,1,
7965,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,12,the 0.4 z4 is right between a yellow metolius and an 0.4 c4,Mar 2012,May 18 2020,12,1,

8407,BD #7 and #8???,4,17,your point about the rating is well taken~ but it's worth comparing a relatively low rated cam with the unrated alternative cams currently on the market,May 2008,Apr 3 2020,3,1,

8618,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,1,imo the friends used to be the better choice because they were lighter~ but since bd redesigned the c4s last year~ i think it basically boils down to whether you like the extendable sling or not,Sep 2014,Jun 22 2020,2,2,
8619,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,1,they are nearly identical besides that.,Sep 2014,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
8620,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,2,i have one set of each~ since wc friends were on sale locally,Sep 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
8621,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,2,the sizes are a wee bit different~ especially the #2 friend being larger to make the range more continuous versus the c4s,Sep 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
8622,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,2,"i only notice looking at camparison~ honestly~ in real life both #2s are ""perfect hand jam"" size for me",Sep 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,2,
8623,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,2,"i have no real opinion on either being ""better"" in any subjective way~ honestly - the extendo sling can be handy when you need just a tiny bit of extension~ but otherwise they both perform identically in my experience",Sep 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,2,
8624,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,2,i'll second that the old c4s were noticeably heavier~ but now c4s and friends are really close in weight.,Sep 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
8625,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i have a frakenrack and honestly don't see the differences between the brands being a big enough differentiator to sway me one way or the other,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8626,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i don't have and wc~ but i do have bd c4s of various vintages and dmms for double axel cams and aliens and metolious cams in the smaller sizes,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8627,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,having an extendable sling is useful at times~ but not to the point where i wouldn't rack a bd without it,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,0,
8628,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i have bd cams with and without a thumb loop (i don't aid climb) so not having a loop on the dmms wasn't a deal breaker,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8629,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i would buy a single rack of whatever is the less expensive option from .5 to #2 or 3 (bd equivalent) and then start augmenting with other options,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8630,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i like the smaller met cams~ and really like the tcus~ plus they are cheaper,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8631,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,in the smaller sizes~ you won't lose as much range with a single axle,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8632,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i actually prefer the red alien #1 over the 0.5 bd,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,2,
8633,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i couldn't really say why~ but i do,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8634,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,i also love x4s if you can still find them the one thing i do~ however~ is rack everything on biners in the bd color scheme,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,2,
8635,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3,so the red alien goes on a purple biner~ the yellow tcu goes on a silver biner...,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8636,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,4,get the wc~ less (known to me) company foibles~ and the thumb loop is still steel so in theory they should last longer outside being reslung.,Apr 2018,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8637,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,5,whichever is cheaper,Mar 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
8638,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,5,both are quality~ the extendable sling is small potatoes for most people,Mar 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,1,
8639,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,5,i'm torn on the sling~ since its kinda a pita to clip both strands sometimes compared to the bd sling.,Mar 2018,Jun 22 2020,2,0,
8640,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,6,friends have the extendable sling which is nice,May 2010,Jun 22 2020,1,2,
8641,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,7,bd c4 is slightly more durable and has a slightly stiffer stem(not rigid),May 2020,Jun 22 2020,1,2,
8642,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,7,i have friedns but have climbed on bd c4 and if you are getting c4 any thing smaller than bd #1 or equivalent you should get the new bd z4 b/c for the couple extra bucks the head width will make them go everywhere! they are currently my favorite piece of gear on my rack.,May 2020,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8643,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,8,wc friends also have wider~ non-anodized lobes that walk less,Sep 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8644,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,8,normal c4s don't have this~ but ultralight c4s produced in 2020 have sandblasted lobes for similar results,Sep 2014,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
8645,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,9,eventualy you'll want a double rack,Oct 2016,Jun 22 2020,1,1,

8651,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,11,less extension than the shortest quickdraws and certainly not worth the hassle they will give your second,Jun 2016,Jun 22 2020,0,1,
8652,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,11,i have dragons and friends and if i could switch one i would take the new c4s over wc friends.,Jun 2016,Jun 22 2020,0,1,

9308,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,3,the first three had been surprisingly durable given how scary thin they are,Jun 2001,Jun 15 2020,1,0,
9309,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,3,i've used them for everything from projecting sport climbs to long routes in the mountains without too much issue other than the psychological leap i've had to make to push my limits on such a thin cord,Jun 2001,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
9310,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,3,they've held up better than expected (i try to keep my expectations conservative for a rope like this),Jun 2001,Jun 15 2020,1,1,
9311,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,3,however~ my current~ and nearly new~ swift developed a horrible and inexplicable core shot during a seemingly casual rappel: i rapped~ everything was fine,Jun 2001,Jun 15 2020,1,1,

9332,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,the rope is stiffer than my mammut serenity,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
9333,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,it feels a little different~ as if the dry coating or aramid fibers have a different feel,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
9334,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,the rope also transmits sounds which was especially noticeable with a weird humming sound while my partner was rappelling,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,2,
9335,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,it kinda sounded like there was a bird in a crack near me but it was the rope,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,

9337,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,this is probably an advantage,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
9338,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,the sheath has a tighter weave and seemed to pick up fewer cactus needles than the serenity.  maybe this is because it is new.  this is an advantage for sure,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,
9339,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8,:) so lots of minor difference none of which really effect anything important and will certainly be considered normal as i use the rope more,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1,1,

9673,hexes are goody style,3,10,"hexes are an epicureanism...""epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest~ sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of ataraxia (tranquility and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires"" hexes~ when placed in their most stable configuration~ form a pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality i.e.  quality(partially owing to their design and interaction with rock) that allows one to climb knowing they have placed the most bomber piece of gear that can be had",Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,2,
9674,hexes are goody style,3,10,this transforms the climbing from one of struggle and despair to one of being able to flow up the rock in a state of harmony and inner peace,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9675,hexes are goody style,3,10,"pirsig of course explained it best: quality~"" or ""value~"" cannot be defined because it empirically precedes any intellectual construction of it~ namely due to the fact that quality exists always as a perceptual experience before it is ever thought of descriptively or academically",Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9676,hexes are goody style,3,10,"quality is the ""knife-edge"" of experience~ found only in the present~ known or at least potentially accessible to all of ""us"" (cf",Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9677,hexes are goody style,3,10,plato's phaedrus~ 258d),Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9678,hexes are goody style,3,10,equating it with the tao~ quality is the fundamental force in the universe stimulating everything from atoms to animals to evolve and incorporate ever greater levels of quality,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9679,hexes are goody style,3,10,according to the metaphysics of quality~ everything (including ideas~ and matter) is a product and a result of quality,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9680,hexes are goody style,3,10,from anthony watt's article on pirsig 2017:so instead of dividing everything into subjects and objects~ pirsig divides reality into dynamic quality (this is capitalised deliberately) and static quality,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9681,hexes are goody style,3,10,‘dynamic quality’ is the term he gives to the continually changing flux of immediately-experienced reality~ while ‘static quality’ refers to any concept abstracted from this flux,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9682,hexes are goody style,3,10,the term ‘dynamic’ indicates something not fixed or determinate~ which means that dynamic quality cannot be defined~ and therefore a true understanding of it can only be given directly in experience,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9683,hexes are goody style,3,10,as herbert günther says in his book philosophy & psychology in the abidharma (1957)~ “the ultimate~ in buddhism~ is something knowable~ though not known by theory or discursive method~ but by direct experience” (p.235),Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,
9684,hexes are goody style,3,10,in other words~ the buddha can’t tell you what dynamic quality is~ but he can point a way so that you can experience it for yourself~ and then you might understand,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,7,1,

9695,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,0,i want a long draw (say 2m long) where it is prehung on a bolt 2m overhead,Oct 2016,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
9696,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,0,you clip the rope through the biner on the draw~ then do something(?) and the draw retracts up to the bolt 2m higher and assume a normal length (10cm or whatever) with normal strength at that length.the motivation here: some clips are scary/impossible through hard sections on a sport route~ and this would allow clipping from a low/good hold and allow you to bust through a crux without stopping.what might work: although klunky~ imagine a microtraxion and a 2m piece of static rope,Oct 2016,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
9697,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,0,the micro is on a bungee and held down by a latch (say~ a fifi on a lower bolt),Oct 2016,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
9698,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,0,you clip through a biner on the micro~ release the bungee and the micro slides 2m up the static rope to create an overhead anchor point,Oct 2016,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
9699,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,0,the above idea is probably too klunky to work in practice~ but something better engineered could be used?  you gear specialists out there have any ideas?,Oct 2016,Jun 15 2020,2,1,
9700,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,1,wondering why this wasn't included since literally everybody will have the thought...how does a stickclip not solve this exact problem?,Apr 2020,Jun 15 2020,28,1,

9711,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,8,my initial thought was a long draw and a short draw but you said you want it to automatically (on a bungee) make your anchor point higher without having to make the clip,Nov 2008,Jun 15 2020,80,1,
