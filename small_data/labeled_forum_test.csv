0,Have a hammock gear quilt right now,1
1,I really like it but am annoyed with the continous baffles and having to move the down each night before I go to bed,0
2,The down always seems to end up in the end of the baffles and it's a fair bit of work to get it back on top where I want it,0
3,I like the pad attachment system that Katabatic uses and was thinking of upgrading but curious if the down will do a better job staying put?,2
4,Do you roll or stuff the quilt when not in use? I have the HG Incubator and haven't had this problem,1
5,Gear with filled insulation like this should be stuffed instead of rolled to avoid pushing the insulation down to the ends I believe,1
6,Best of luck with your hang~,1
7,I stuff it and every night the down ends up at the ends of the baffles on the sides of the bag and has to be pushed back,0
8,It stays put if I spend 2 nights in the same place but there’s something about how I’m stuffing it I guess I have like 5 other bags including another HG bad and don’t have problems with any others,0
9,I've had one of the Katabatic 20 degree quilt for the last 6 years,2
10,No issues like you're describing with down bunching up,2
11,I use the tiny stuff sack it came with backpacking and there are no problems~ but for car camping I stuff it loosely in a reusable grocery bag just in case it prolongs the quilt's life,2
12,One of my favorite pieces of gear!,2
13,I know this is kind of old news~ but what is the general opinion of 5.10 shoes now that Adidas owns the brand? Specifically~ the new dragon lace ups and the rubber,1
14,Is stealth rubber still being used and is it still as sticky as before?,1
15,Adidas has owned 5.10 since 2011~ longer than most have been climbing.,1
16,I think overwhelmingly~ the change has hurt the brand,0
17,Shoes that people like are discontinued,0
18,Sizes can vary between manufacturing runs,0
19,New shoe designs underwhelming and under-performing compared to previously designed shoes,0
20,People are not sure about the rubber~ if its changed or not,0
21,The one big positive is they firesale them quite frequently,2
22,Meh,0
23,That may have been when there was a transaction but the major changes~ like closing the American production facilities and moving production to Asia started happening more recently,1
24," I dunno about the rubber~ but I have some moccs and while I like the fit they are already fraying in the ""leather"" around the edge after about 15-20 climbing days.",2
25,I wore guide tennis before and after Adidas took over~ and have noticed a huge decline in quality since the takeover,0
26,Whatever Adidas uses to glue the rubber to the bottom of the shoe started peeling off almost immediately~ and pretty soon the entire front end of the rubber becomes unglued and hangs there like a reverse flip-flop,0
27,This happened to two pairs in a row,0
28,After that~ I switched to Sportiva approach shoes~ which I've been happy with,2
29,Big issue with sizing changes and durability occurred when they moved production to Asia,0
30,They seem to quickly fall apart and wear under normal use now.,0
31,same story here with approach shoes,1
32,#fakenews,1
33,Sizing from adidas is a huge issue - if I find a pair that fits me in a store~ maybe I'll buy them~ but maybe not~ because I'll never be able to get a second pair of the same shoe~ back to the starting line of finding a pair of shoes I like,0
34,Certainly will never order another pair again~ as there's no telling what actual size will come in the mail~,0
35,That includes approach shoes,1
36,It's worth remention that a bunch of five.ten employees went and started the company Unparallel recently,1
37,I had one pair until they were stolen~ and I was super impressed with the quality and the rubber,2
38,I'll buy those again.,2
39,I never had the american made shoes~ but the Adidas 5.10 shoes I have tried have been less than impressive in terms of quality compared to the Italian brands,0
40,My own previous snarkiness aside~ I’ve experienced and observed more Sportiva quality issues than any other brand,0
41,I haven’t bought a new pair of hiangles in a couple years~ but I’ve never had 5.10 issues myself.,2
42,Yeah I would say of the major brands~ the biggest QC issues have been Evolv and La Sportiva,0
43,TC Pro delams~ Miura toe blowouts in 2 months...they’re pretty infamous for it,0
44,The Five Tens I’ve owned have all been top notch in construction,2
45,Only owned one pair of Scarpas but they’ve impressed me~ even though they don’t fit my feet that great.,2
46,Same here,1
47,I haven't been climbing long enough to have used 'American' 5.10~ but after being disappointed with the Adidas Pink Anasazi I bought the Unparallel UP Lace and I've been using them for maybe 6 months or so,0
48,I'll probably buy another pair soon too~ as my current ones are getting a bit too comfy to the detriment of performance.,0
49,I’ve been using 5.10 since they started and during the transition to Adidas,1
50,I recently bought a pair of Grandstones and have to say they are the best built pair of shoes I’ve ever bought from them~ very high quality build,2
51,And BTW~ they are still using C4 the same sticky rubber,1
52,I have some guide tennies from before and after the factory shut down (seemingly where the issues started~ not the change of ownership),0
53,The ones before the shut down are older~ more used and..,0
54,in SIGNIFICANTLY better condition,2
55,The ones purchased almost a year later are already all but useless with the bottom rubber almost completely detached,0
56,I will say I talked to an adidas rep who said they tried pretty hard to change the C4 rubber (trying to make it more eco friendly) but could not do it,0
57,So supposedly it is the same rubber,1
58,FWIW~ I love my 5.10 Quantum lace-ups and the Stealth rubber that they used,2
59,It lasted me about 6 months and I am now about to send them in to be resoled,1
60,However~ I have found that 5.10/Adidas is absolute dog shit when it comes to customer service,0
61,It has taken them 2-3 days to even ship shoes that I have bought through their super sale and~ even then~ shipping is slow (always more than a week from shipping date in my experience),0
62,Additionally~ I ordered a couple pairs of Team VXIs which just didn't fit my foot well and~ despite them having received the shoes~ I have not heard anything regarding my refund,0
63,Bottom line: love the shoes~ not the customer service,2
64,Buy em from literally any retailer other than Adidas themselves,0
65,I think any current 5.10 issues were also present before Adidas bought them~ sizing and quality included,0
66,If anything they may have improved in some ways with the support of the larger company,2
67,Haven't heard any current complaints regarding a drop in the rubber quality,2
68,For every 5.10 complaint I've heard regarding delaminating~ I've heard one for Sportiva as well,1
69,5.10 quality was always inferior to the European shoe makers,0
70,It is the Dodge Charger of climbing shoe companies and always was,0
71,Adidas buying them was like Fiat buying Chrysler - SOS.,0
72,Delam issues are not always the manufacturers fault,1
73,Shoes get abused~ they get thrown in the back of a car and sit it the hot sun and bake,1
74,They get wet from sweat and then thrown into the bottom of a pack and then 30lbs of gear gets loaded on top and then we wonder why my shoes are starting to delaminate,1
75,Take care of you shoes,1
76,It’s like to new climber who’s shoes are blown out in the toe after a month and they complain that it’s a manufacturer defect when it’s clearly poor footwork,1
77,I’ve never had a pair of Five Ten climbing shoes delam and I’ve been using them since Five Ten started,2
78,I have had one pair of Guide Tennies start to delam but that was quickly fixed with a bit of super glue gel,0
79,I'm old...53 to be exact~ and I have not had any issues with my multiple 5.10 shoes: Spires~ Pinks~ Coyotes and Gambits (and more that I can't remember),0
80,But they were all made in the USA and have all had many resoles,2
81,The Coyotes are about done~ the inside liner is all but gone and the leather is wearing through from the inside,0
82,Fantastic smearing shoe IMO,2
83,The highest quality shoe I've ever had is the Boreal Ballet Gold~ they are just a really well made shoe,2
84,Lots of stitching and rubber~ in the right places~ to make the shoes super durable,2
85,I go through a lot of laces~ because these are crack shoes,0
86,I also own the Boreal Ninja~ which also are super well made,2
87,La Sportiva is more hit and miss,0
88,My Cobras only took two resoles before they were toast,0
89,My Mythos on the other hand have been resoled at least four times~ maybe 5,2
90,My Kaukulators were the same way....many many resoles before the leather ripped,2
91,My first pair was orange~ I remember that~ long gone~ but lasted a few seasons,1
92,Only pair of Scarpa I ever had was the Helix~ not that great a shoe IMO,0
93,I don't climb much severely overhanging stuff~ or pockets~ so I don't really have a need for a super aggressive shoe~ so maybe my choice of shoes just last longer than others.,1
94,Strongly disagree,0
95,I used to order 1-2 pairs of the same darn size of Ansazi Velcros  every year for years and years~ and got the same shoe every time~ from 2002ish? to 2012,2
96,I could take them out of the box~ throw them in the pack~ and wear them 1st time at a cliff~ always the very same shoe.,2
97,I started using 5.10 in 1996,1
98,Before that I had a few pairs of Boreals (Vector/Laser/Ballet)~ Scarpas (Rockmaster)~ Asolos (Opera) and La Sportivas (Kendo/SuperX/Ballerina/Mythos),1
99,In 5.10~ before Adidas took over~ I used the Razor (best shoe ever)~ VX~ UFO~ RockSox~ Moccs~ and Ansazi lace and Velcro,1
100,Since 2011~ I've had several pairs of Dragons~ various Anasazis~ as well as a couple pairs of Quantums~ HiAngles and Arrowheads,1
101,Before 2012 or so~ I had absolutely no issues with sizing in 5.10~ and I could find them in a store and actually try them on,2
102,Since about that time frame~ the sizing seems to be all over the place~ and since it seems like no store carries the brand any longer~ it is basically a complete lottery whether the pair I ordered will fit or not,0
103,I have had size 7 fit perfectly~ but then I wasn't able to get an 8 on my feet at all~ and I have (somewhat) comfortably worn 5.10 anywhere from size 6.5 to 8.5,0
104,This is really unfortunate~ and I have started to drift to Sportiva as result,0
105,Though they don't fit quite as well~ the sizing is more consistent than 5.10~ and they have better rubber than Boreal,2
106,As for 5.10 quality issues~ I have had none outside of a pair of Anasazi Pinks literally splitting in apart at the heel after three days of use,0
107,Customer service was completely unresponsive when I tried to warranty them~ so that wasn't that great either,0
108,I did have the same thing happen on a pair of VXs~ but that was after a resole~ and they were a super light weight shoe that 5.10 made for only 1 year in the late 90s.,0
109,Second this comment,1
110,Guide Tennis were my favorite and only approach shoe,2
111,My last purchase (maybe 2.5 years ago) the sole came off within the first season,0
112,Send them back~ got a new pair~ happened again,0
113,I switched to Sportivas as well and have been very  happy!,2
114,I know a few sponsored climbers and apparently a former rep who all feel that the rubber is not the same,0
115,The new Adidas factory has only been producing shoes for about the past 9 months and not all retailers have the new stock,0
116,There is a very stark difference between the new and old Hiangle construction,0
117,You can tell if you have the new ones as the toe hook rubber is thinner and inside the shoe there is a horizontal seam near the midsole,0
118,Also~ the label is different,1
119,I loved my old Five Tens so much that I stockpiled many of them,2
120,The Teams never changed nor did the old Dragons,2
121,The new Hiangles feel uber stiff and insensitive and the heel fits differently (better for me~ doesn't bag out),2
122,I loved that the Hiangle had some stiffness~ but you could still microadjust and pull with the toes,2
123,The newest ones I have feel a lot like an Instinct VS or Solution when new~ but both of those shoes break in quicker and better,2
124,I don't feel that the rubber is as sticky,0
125,The Aleon is a love/hate,0
126,Most people I know like the heel for its fit~ but not for heel hooking,2
127,The stretchiness of the upper means you have to really crank the velcro for it not to move during heel hooks~ but it won't pull off,2
128,The main issue is the toebox can be love/hate,0
129,It is one of the only toeboxes that pushes the big toe inwards and it is almost diamond shaped rather than a talon like the Dragon or Solution and for some it just never gets comfortable,0
130,You can see my other posts about the Dragons~ but almost no sponsored climbers are wearing the shoe and very few normal people I have met seem to like it,0
131,While the build quality is higher~ the design isn't there,0
132,They feel more like an Evolv than a Five Ten,1
133,Let's be honest- no one ever bought Five Ten for durability,0
134,They were designed to perform and be comfortable on granite for the most part and they don't do that very well anymore.,0
135,I generally like 5.10 shoes and have owned many different pairs over the years~ but my experience with them lately (like last 6 months) has been awful,0
136,I've sent at least 5 pairs of shoes back due to sizing issues,0
137,And just to add insult to injury~ I got a pair of Hiangles from the recent sale that fit but one of the shoes they sent has exposed stitching and is delaminating on the side,0
138,I would've been done with them long ago but I'm trying to use a gift certificate..,0
139,super frustrating.,0
140,Interesting to find this thread because I have been wondering about this,1
141,Have been using 5.10 products for over 30 years and they have ALWAYS had quality and sizing issues,0
142,They have also pretty much been the high-performance standard even with said issues,2
143,Sad to hear people think they are getting worse,0
144,I found this thread while searching for 5.10's new website to buy some new shoes,1
145,Yikes,0
146,Pic up some Acopa’s instead.,2
147,Been climbing in 5.10 shoes for about 10 years,2
148,Love my pinks~ quantums and mocs,2
149,"I bought a pair of quantum velcros and loved them~ so I bought another pair~ which are 1/4"" smaller",2
150,I haven't been able to break them in,0
151,Concerned about size issues~ too.,0
152,I was just thinking about this,1
153,A factor two falls puts a much higher shock on the climber and the anchor system than a factor one fall,1
154,"But a ""soft"" catch~ such as was required before modern climbing ropes were invented~ would reduce these forces to something safer",1
155,"A soft catch is tricky to practice~ however~ which is why in the pre-modern-rope era there was the saying~ ""the leader must not fall."" But~ what if there was a device like a Grigri that had a ""soft catch"" mode that would gradually (but obviously very quickly) slow the fall~ thus reducing peak forces on the anchor to something safe? Ideally this mode could be quickly shut off by flicking a switch in the device after pro is placed above the anchor",1
156,Any thoughts on this?,1
157,1/10 Soft catches are overrated in the outdoors unless you are climbing some bad ass overhang route.,1
158,Is this a troll comment?,1
159,Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week,1
160,To get the precision required to do a soft catch correctly in different circumstances you need a computer,1
161,Our brains are that computer,1
162,I think that building a purely mechanical device that could perform a soft catch and was also simple and reliable enough to use for everyday belaying would be very challenging,0
163,Plus it would probably do the wrong thing most of the time.,0
164,Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week Next week doesn't help much~ but if someone could spike me into next year~ that would be great,1
165,I think I have had enough of 2020.,1
166,Even with our brains computing the forces there isn’t much you can do to soften a FF2 fall when using a Grigri,1
167,The OP had the idea that the soft catch feature could be turned off,1
168,You are only in  FF2 territory until the first clip is made~ then shift into normal belay mode,1
169,I agree it would be a challenge to make the device but the concept is interesting,1
170,Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week Can you explain how spiking happens on a less than overhanging route?,1
171,Better to just install autobelays on all outdoor routes and slowly lower everyone when they fall,1
172,thats what the rope is for,1
173,you can also modify your belay geometry to eliminate factor 2 fall,1
174,Who is taking factor 2 falls routinely? Who is even taking factor 1 falls routinely? Most lead falls are like factor 0.5 or less~ unless you've done something really~ really wrong,1
175,What you're talking about could only happen in those first few feet between leaving an anchor and placing your first piece on a multipitch,1
176,And that's only if the multipitch is actually steep and vertical,1
177,The follower should be connected to the anchor with their rope~ which will help to absorb the shock,1
178,Can you explain how spiking happens on a less than overhanging route? Climber falls~ and the belayer~ a sadist~ sits back into their harness as hard they possibly can - just as the climber's weight comes onto the rope.,1
179,I don't think they can make it,1
180,It is either locked or open,1
181,Any engineers out there?,1
182,Trango Cinch?,1
183,I think the answer is similar to the answer to the question “Why aren’t Yates Screamer dogbones more popular?” The market doesn’t demand a supply,1
184,As a moot/academic discussion~ though~ I’d be curious to hear your design constraints/requirements/ideas you would suggest for the device~ though..,1
185,What kind of impact/force reduction is already offered by an ATC~ pilot~ megajul~ gri-gri~ cinch~ revo~ whatever..,1
186,Have you considered the impact-reduction provided by dynamic rope stretch in a factor 2 fall? How does that compare to the potential reduction of maximum force you’d be looking to achieve via the device?,1
187,Is this a troll comment?   Dear RRG climbers..,1
188,The RRG is basically a gym.,1
189,Climber falls~ and the belayer~ a sadist~ sits back into their harness as hard they possibly can - just as the climber's weight comes onto the rope,1
190,I'll make this easy for you~ Artem,1
191,"In a less than OVERHANGING fall gravity~ not the sadistic belayer~ is what ""slams"" you into the wall",1
192,!/  instead of /! where the climber is !,1
193,Best bet in any less than overhanging fall is to put the brakes on it ASAP,1
194," In an overhanging situation where you're run out a bit it's the pendulum of you swinging back into the wall that ""spikes"" you and where a ""soft catch"" can be helpful",1
195,Sounds complex~ I'm trying to think of what sort of mechanism could give you a reliable soft catch,1
196,Hmm...,1
197,I guess you could have a mechanism that releases the GriGri a little~ just like the lever does~ when the device is pulled away from the belayer using a spring or something,1
198,If the spring is set so it takes~ say~ a few kN to pull it there you go,1
199,Maybe it could even be a thing you put on a regular GriGri rather than a new device,1
200,"Though~ I feel like most of the chill trad routes I do have a place to get a bomber ""Jesus piece"" in coming off the belay~ so it's not hard to minimize the chance of a factor two fall",1
201,How many routes out there have belays where you can't really avoid being in a factor two situation?,1
202,That's not what spiking is.,1
203,I'll make this easy for you~ Artem,1
204,"In an overhanging situation where you're run out a bit it's the pendulum of you swinging back into the wall that ""spikes"" you and where a ""soft catch"" can be helpful",1
205,A good belayer can give you a soft catch by moving with the pull of the rope and will decrease the force on the climber as they fall,1
206,A bad belayer will sit back and mess you up by increasing the speed of the swing you take into the wall,1
207,It blows my mind how many people don't understand what a soft catch is and how to give one,1
208,Normally it's either noobs who are in their first few seasons or crusty trad dads that catch one fall per season that deal most of the worst spikes I've seen.,1
209,The mountain project like count may agree with you,1
210,The laws of physics do not.,1
211,I'm seconding this because the original quote has 12 misinformed likes and counting,1
212," Besides that~ the ""soft catch"" proposal for Grigris isn't about spiking the faller~ it is about reducing the maximum impact load to the gear and team",1
213,That happens because some fall energy is dissipated by friction when the rope is allowed to run under tension,1
214,Spiking is a result of penduluming into the wall on a very short fall on overhanging ground,1
215,Lengthening the fall puts the overhanging wall further away and allows the leader to hit with reduced impact as their pendulum crosses the vertical and starts ascending,1
216,On less than vertical ground~ the pendulum never crosses the vertical (obviously) so there is no impact reduction~ and meanwhile adding length to the fall risks smacking the falling leader into features or ledges.,1
217,"""Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week"" Now~ I suppose you're correct that 90 degrees is 1 degree LESS THAN OVERHANGING",1
218,So~ yeah~ for all those exactly VERTICAL climbs with no obstacles sticking out of the face you are correct,1
219,"In most of the real world of climbing~ though~ ""less than overhanging"" means ""less than vertical."" Don't go soft-catching anyone on slab",1
220,Or blocky alpine terrain,1
221,Or a 5.9 Royal Robbins classic like The Open Book,1
222,You'll break your climber's legs or worse,1
223,On less than vertical ground~ the pendulum never crosses the vertical (obviously) so there is no impact reduction~ and meanwhile adding length to the fall risks smacking the falling leader into features or ledges,1
224,Most of the ledge falls I've seen are belayers giving their climbers hard catches and swinging them straight into a ledge that they would have otherwise fallen right past,1
225,Even a small feature can ruin your talus bones/ankles with a bad belay.,1
226,Most of the ledge falls I've seen are belayers giving their climbers hard catches and swinging them straight into a ledge that they would have otherwise fallen past,1
227,"  Note above~ ""small jump."" ",1
228,Don't go soft-catching anyone on slab,1
229,Way to make a strawman by moving the goal posts to slab lol,1
230," Note above~ ""small jump.""  If you are above a huge ledge that you won't fall past - then this is a special situation where a tight belay would be warranted",1
231,This is relatively rare and a good belayer will know when to do it,1
232,Hard catches should never be a one size fits all policy,1
233,How about a Munter?,1
234,Spiking is a result of penduluming into the wall on a very short fall on overhanging ground,1
235,For the people liking Artem's posts: Read the bold part and take the time to understand it.,1
236,For the people liking Artem's posts: Read the bold part and take the time to understand it,1
237,A soft catch will reduce the speed of the climber before they come in contact with the wall - a hard catch won't do this and more deceleration will occur when the climber comes into contact with the wall (this rapid deceleration is what causes the injury),1
238,You will always have flight time before you touch the wall on a vertical wall (less than overhanging) - the only time you wouldn't is if you are on a slab (less than vertical).,1
239,Artem~ This youtube video demonstrates your point pretty well.youtube.com/watch?v=_0GGsBg…  Even when the climbers tie-in is only .5 m from the vertical point of the pendulum the speed at impact was substantially lower using a soft catch,1
240,It also appeared to be lower well before the vertical point of the pendulum~ although they don't put numbers on the screen for that.,1
241,Soft Catches are stupid~ just don't keep people too tight or too loose,1
242,They'll be fine.,1
243,I think you missed a crucial point,1
244,"The discussion here has been about ""less than overhanging"" climbs",1
245,Nobody has disputed that a soft catch on overhanging climbs is a nice feature and can keep a climber from swinging back into the wall/rock.,1
246,This video also doesn't represent the technique in a soft catch~ because the belayer is static~ they are just adding slack to the system,1
247,That is not how a soft catch works.,1
248,No~ I didn't miss that point,1
249,I looked up the video because I essentially agree with you from a physics perspective~ but it doesn't align with my personal experience,1
250,The portion of the video where the climber is 0.5 m from the pendulum point models a vertical~ not overhanging~ route pretty well (IMO),1
251,My ass is often 1.5 feet from the wall when climbing~ and if I fall doing something dynamic I would imagine it could end up out even farther than that,1
252,The video concludes - through mathematical analysis and empirical modeling - that climber speed as they impact the wall is lower with a soft catch in that situation,1
253,The data shown when demonstrating this convinced me that the same would be true on a slightly slabby route,1
254,That is not how a soft catch works,1
255,It's pretty clear here that you haven't actually watched the video.,1
256,It's pretty clear here that you haven't actually watched the video,1
257,That is why I went back to finish it,1
258,Their early examples were terrible,0
259,But I agree that a soft catch is a good thing in most circumstances,2
260,A soft catch will reduce the speed of the climber before they come in contact with the wall - a hard catch won't do this and more deceleration will occur when the climber comes into contact with the wall (this rapid deceleration is what causes the injury),1
261,You will always have flight time before you touch the wall on a vertical wall (less than overhanging) - the only time you wouldn't is if you are on a slab (less than vertical),1
262,"Any physics professor would tell you that your first paragraph is gibberish (and the rest isn't even relevant to a fall on a dynamic rope.) The force of the rope catching the climber is not a material ""impact."" The static rope analogy is irrelevant because we don't climb on static ropes",1
263,The dynamic properties of the rope are more than adequate to eliminate any risk of injury due to the forces of the rope catching the fall,1
264,"The dynamic rope will make the ""catch"" part of the catch soft enough",1
265,On a high fall factor fall you may feel the rope catching you hard~ but it can't hurt you,1
266,Dynamic ropes are specifically engineered to eliminate that risk.,1
267,That is why I went back to finish it,1
268,When would a soft catch be bad then?,1
269,When would a soft catch be bad then? That catch should match the terrain~ the gear~ the belayer/climber weight ratio~ and a number of other factors that most gumbies cannot understand,1
270,But hopefully with a good in person tutor~ they can move beyond gumbyland and figure these things out,1
271,That catch should match the terrain~ the gear~ the belayer/climber weight ratio~ and a number of other factors that most gumbies cannot understand,1
272,Please speak Gumby,1
273,So when is a soft catch bad?,1
274,Please speak Gumby,1
275," So when is a soft catch bad? You have already stated that for you ""Soft catches are overrated in the outdoors unless you are climbing some bad ass overhang route.""  Stick with your gym climbing and trolling",1
276,TRE Sirius was designed to slip a bit and mimic the behavior of a Munter,1
277,By far my favorite belay devices~ but out of production a very long time at this point.,1
278,Artem~ I figured out the disconnect,1
279,"You're taking ""less than overhanging"" to ONLY mean plumb vertical",1
280,"The rest of us are taking ""less than overhanging"" to mean~ well~ all climbs that are LESS THAN OVERHANGING",1
281,That means everything from some 5.2 beginner trad route to big portions of even El Cap,1
282,Here's what's missing in the video~ IMO: She's falling into empty space,1
283,Put an 85 degree angle of granite under her and redo it,1
284,Then let's talk,1
285,Artem~ I figured out the disconnect,1
286,Even plumb vertical isn't going to change the parameters much,1
287,"Once again~ rgold nailed it: ""on less than vertical ground~ [or even plumb vertical] the pendulum never crosses the vertical""",1
288,Haha~ especially at the end when they say if you are doing trad climbing~ forget everything we said,1
289,(But~ actually~  some of it should be relevant...),1
290,Even plumb vertical isn't going to change the parameters much,1
291,"Once again~ rgold nailed it: ""on less than vertical ground~ [or even plumb vertical] the pendulum never crosses the vertical"" No need to make it personal",1
292,"I'll be the first to admit I'm not versed in the physics~ but in my experience~ on a vertical wall I much prefer a moderately soft catch if there is nothing to hit (I suppose we could debate ad nauseam what constitutes a ""feature~"" but I'm thinking of climbing in the 5.10/11 and up range~ so fairly small holds",1
293,A ledge~ even a small one~ would change the calculus,1
294,"We could also debate ad nauseam what constitutes a ""moderately"" soft catch)",1
295,Most of my partners agree~ and that's the kind of catch I will give them~ or anyone in such a scenario unless they explicitly request otherwise,1
296,"The alternative--a hard lock-off--results in~ not necessarily a ""spike~"" but at the least~ uncomfortable impacts on vertical walls.",1
297,When would a soft catch be bad then? When the extra length of the fall would cause the leader to hit a ledge or the ground or other feature.,1
298,So a munter then..,1
299,Well at least it’s free.,1
300,Grigris kill.,0
301,Figuring out a “send” mode for climbing shoes sounds just as possible and far more useful.,1
302,"(But~ actually~  some of it should be relevant...) If this post from a Mathematics University Professeur (also with his long-time practical experience in climbing which is many more years than most of us have been alive) does not end this discussion on ""soft-catch"" (and he even acknowledges that under ideal circumstances it might just be better) then there is no way that you are open to changing your mind.",1
303,Didn’t someone ask years ago~ “Why can’t belay devices have an idiot mode?”  And thus the Gri Gri was born,2
304,Don’t push your luck,1
305,Lol,1
306,As someone who's climbed a lot of steep stuff in the Red but also a lot of vert and slab in NC~ I almost always give and prefer to receive a soft catch,1
307,I don't know what people are talking about when they say you should give a hard catch on slab,1
308,I've taken plenty of slab falls~ and the ones that suck the most are when I get a hard catch,1
309,On everything but very low angle friction slab you're usually falling slightly away from the wall~ and a hard catch increases the impact into the wall,1
310,On vertical terrain I couldn't imagine thinking a hard catch is better~ you're falling away from the wall and you're going to swing back in so it'd be dumb to make that swing fast and short with a hard catch,1
311,Honestly~ I sometimes prefer a hard catch on really steep stuff because I'm not gonna hit anything but air anyway~ and it makes it less work to boink back up,1
312,The Grigri 7,1
313,No need to make it personal,1
314,"The alternative--a hard lock-off--results in~ not necessarily a ""spike~"" but at the least~ uncomfortable impacts on vertical walls",1
315,"I think the folks screaming ""I wouldn't let person X belay me"" are the ones making it personal",1
316,"And phrases like ""spike into next week"" are the spray.",1
317,There are many ways a climber can get spiked on a 'vertical' route,1
318,Admittedly~ probably not as hard as on an overhung route~ but it can still happen,1
319,Climber could fall while doing a move that requires lots of outward force such as a layback or pulling on an undercling with smeared feet,1
320,Another scenario is anytime you're not directly above your last pro such as on a traverse,1
321,Traversing out of a corner would essentially be the same as a roof.,1
322,Traversing out of a corner would essentially be the same as a roof,1
323,Injuries are caused by kinetic energy,1
324,Counterpressure moves are very unlikely to contribute enough energy into the system to cause injury.,1
325,You can absolutely spike somebody on a vertical wall - since you fall out and then back in,1
326,A hard catch will swing you into the wall violently~ while a soft catch will absorb most of the speed of a fall before you touch the wall,1
327,Why are you pushing off the wall when you fall? Don't blame your belayer just because you don't know how to fall properly,1
328,Why are you pushing off the wall when you fall? Don't blame your belayer just because you don't know how to fall properly This response is amusing,1
329,"Have you ever fallen off of a vertical wall? You don't need to ""push"" to fall outwards - you will always come off the wall and then come back into the wall~ no matter what you do",1
330,"And generally~ to ""push"" off the wall~ you have to fall intentionally~ which is something I don't do - since this is a mistake newer/less practiced climbers will make when they are scared and unwilling to keep climbing",1
331,I typically fall when either going for the next move and missing~ or from a spontaneous foot slip,1
332," You don't need to ""push"" to fall outwards",1
333,If you are moving outwards~ something needs to push,1
334,What is this mysterious force that causes some climbers to fall horizontally outwards?,1
335,What is this mysterious force that causes some climbers to fall horizontally outwards? You're telling me that on a perfectly vertical wall~ you'll fall down~ flush with the wall and scrape it the entire way? Lol,1
336,Your responses have been pretty absurd so far~ but now I am dying to see you demonstrate this master falling technique,1
337,This response is amusing,1
338,So~ you fall when you miss whatever move you were trying (aka a mistake; something you are claiming you don't do),1
339,Have you thought that maybe you missed that move because you were incorrectly pushing off the wall with your feet our pulling out on a hold with your hand? So~again~ don't blame your belayer because you made a mistake.,1
340,You're telling me that on a perfectly vertical wall~ you'll fall down~ flush with the wall and scrape it the entire way? Lol,1
341,Your responses have been pretty absurd so far~ but now I am dying to see you demonstrate this Only our hands and feet are in contact with the wall,1
342,Our center of gravity (basically our hips) is always away from the rock (at most by about the length of our arms which can be about two feet~ but rarely does one fall just as their arms are completely extended horizontally.) On a plumb vertical wall our center of gravity is typically about a foot from the wall,1
343,I have inadvertently done it,1
344,Lightweight climber (~100lbs)~ heavier belayer (~160lbs),1
345,Climber was approximately .5m above the bolt~ with about 10m of rope in service,1
346,Granite slab climb~ just less than vertical with a short crux of almost vertical terrain,1
347,Climber fell and I gave an unintentional hard catch,1
348,The climber fell out slightly from the wall then the rope came tight and she accelerated into the wall and twisted her ankle.,1
349,"What is this mysterious force that causes some climbers to fall horizontally outwards? My impression is that the ""mysterious force"" you are asking about depends on the mechanics of falling",1
350,If your hand pops off and your feet stay on~ you will tilt back slightly as you fall,1
351,Have you thought that maybe you missed that move because you were incorrectly pushing off the wall with your feet our pulling out on a hold with your hand? So~again~ don't blame your belayer because you made a mistake,1
352,This response is so blatantly obtuse and disingenuous - but yes~ please continue giving me lessons on technique despite you at best being a 5.10 sport climber :),1
353,Only our hands and feet are in contact with the wall,1
354,There absolutely can be and often is an outward component to climbing a vertical face,1
355,Are you only pulling straight down when you climb or are you exerting an outward component to your pull? If you are pulling out some~ what are our feet doing? Now~ what are your feet doing when hands~ that have some outward pull~ pop off the holds,1
356,I don’t know much about the physics~ but anyone who has actually taken or even caught enough falls on vertical terrain can attest to the potential for spiking~ especially if you’re a lighter climber,1
357,If your physics model doesn’t come up with this then I question whether the model is correct.,1
358,If your physics model doesn’t come up with this then I question whether the model is correct.,1
359,Our center of gravity (basically our hips) is always away from the rock (at most by about the length of our arms which can be about two feet~ but rarely does one fall just as their arms are completely extended horizontally.)  Would you do this little experiment next time you are climbing a vertical wall,1
360,He’s not the one modeling what forces the climber is applying.,1
361,Would you do this little experiment next time you are climbing a vertical wall Dude~ you're right! A force that no one can explain pushed me away from the wall just as I fell!,1
362,This response is so blatantly obtuse and disingenuous - but yes~ please continue giving me lessons on technique despite you being a 5.10 sport climber :)  You are right about my abilities,1
363,I don't chase grades but have been pushing into the 11's lately with a new gym opening with a great setter,1
364,But~ I still don't see why I need to climb at such an elite level as you to know how to fall properly,1
365,But~ what does my tick list have to do with physics or this discussion? If anything~ it will tell the average climber that I spend more time on low angle/vertical terrain than you do where the types of falls in question happen~ since generally~ the higher in grades you get in sport~ the more overhanging it is~ right? I'm not the one blaming everyone else for my mistakes,1
366,Look at your post history~ you have a tendency to do just that.,1
367,There's really only one expert for physics questions:,1
368,I've only ever fallen straight down a climb once,1
369,Slightly less than vert~ spead eage with tenuous holds and a foot popped~ causing the hands to pop~ and down I slid,1
370,On anything near vert~ you will almost always have an outward force because you are pulling down and out at some vector,1
371,Plus~ it would suck to fall directly down~ hitting your pro/bolts and getting tangled in the rope,1
372,Typically it is a hand that gives out~ causing a pivot outwards ad your feet are briefly still on a hold or 2~ IME,1
373,Some of the worst falls I've had are knees at pro~ lower on a route~ with a quick swing into the rock,1
374,I don't think a soft catch would be timed correctly~ but having a little extra rope out seems to help,1
375,Very small holds on off vert slab might be different~ but I'm too scared (or scarred) to fall.,1
376,I'm not the one blaming everyone else for my mistakes,1
377,Look at your post history~ you have a tendency to do just that,1
378,Lol~ what a bold and baseless accusation,1
379,Feel free to provide some examples,1
380,I remember our last interaction was you trying to blame me for being dropped by my belayer (a gym employee dropping me in a gym - and then also faulting me for knowing other climbers who had also been dropped at some point in their careers),1
381,That was a nasty interaction that left me with a rather bad impression of you,1
382,You are right about my abilities,1
383,If you fall straight down a vert wall in a gym..,1
384,well~ I think you would only do that once,1
385,You will purposefully put some outward momentum into your fall (it will be there even if you don't) to avoid breaking your ankles on the way down.,1
386,I’ll certainly take the opinion of someone who has taken and/or held hundreds/thousands of falls before listening to the opinion of a physics expert who has taken/caught very few,1
387,Now if you happen to be both...that’s even better.,1
388,Lol~ what a bold and baseless accusation,1
389,You are the same Artem who got a college degree because everyone else told you to do it and then wanted to default on your loans right?,1
390,You are the same Artem who got a college degree because everyone else told you to do it and then wanted to default on your loans right? Ooh buddy - you had to go all the way back to my first posts on this forum (over 900 posts ago) and even then you couldn't come up with a proper example,1
391,And yes~ I'd still default on my private loans if it means the difference between buying groceries and paying for my loans,1
392,Quite a few young people are in the same predicament as me in today's America,1
393,Thanks.,1
394,I think the whole debate has assumed semi-religious overtones with neither side wanting to give ground,1
395,It occurs against the background of the sometimes contentious trad-sport arguments~ with each side claiming superior knowledge the other side doesn't have~ this in spite of the fact that many people do both types of climbing,1
396,It has been established that when hard-locking belay devices like the Grigri are employed~ properly-timed soft catches can reduce impacts to the anchor,1
397," In fact~ the entire soft-catch concept took hold because of the ""hardness"" of the autolocking belay",1
398,The variability in the effectiveness remains an unaddressed issue~ as people speak of a soft catch as if it is an unvarying intervention unrelated to the host of conditions surrounding the belay event,1
399,From this perspective~ a tendency has evolved to blame the belayer for everything untoward that happens to a falling leader~ as if the soft catch was some kind of magical shield against all possible injury~ hence any injury becoming prima facie evidence of belayer misconduct,1
400,The issue of spiking has to do with the effects of penduluming into the rock~ and is not necessarily the same as reducing the load to the anchors; this is another area where the soft-catch discussion is muddled~ as the only published test results I've seen have to do with anchor loads~ not pendulum impacts,1
401," The video linked above is one of the few sources of information about the results of pendulums~ and as I mentioned it looks as if~ in the more nearly vertical situation~ and especially with short falls~  that the climber might be  ""spiking"" before the jump can mitigate the pendulum effects",1
402,This doesn't mean the soft catch might not have some application to single-pitch trad climbing~ but it does mean that extrapolating from other experience is fraught,1
403,We'd all be better off if we could get away from the smug proclamations and admit we know a lot less than we think.,1
404,Is this a bad idea? Does a bear shit in the woods? yes,1
405,A soft catch is just super incredible easy to master,1
406,You hardly have to do anything~ just let your hips give in and move at the right time,1
407,You be failin' and spikin' your leader if you are terrifiend and brace like you're getting hit by a linebacker and resistin' that movement,1
408,Also~ people must at some point learn to climb~ learn when that ol' soft catch is appropriate or not~ and not hope all this technologizin' will solve their many problems,1
409,That being said~ it's 2020~ not 1989~ so never use a non-brake assist tube style device unless youse inSANE!!!,1
410,Not sure if you noticed the different sides and where they live,1
411,For example~ places like RRG it makes sense to do a soft catch,1
412,On granite walls (California) those people generally tend to be less friendly with the soft catches,1
413,Hard/Soft Catch is like debating politics,1
414,Covid is a Hoax ;-),1
415,Seems this is solved pretty easily by just seeking out a rope with lower impact rating rather than the voodoo of jumping at whatever you /think/ is the right time to jump,1
416,As Rgold mentioned~ without actual~ personal~ measured data on the forces involved~ and a lot of practice~ you never really /know/ it you’re actually doing anything productive~ or making things worse.,1
417,I would prefer a person who reads the conditions of the fall and adjusts based on knowing/experience than an overly complicated device~ some of which require more experience to employ well.,1
418,Watch the climber~ pro~ and terrain and do what you think is in the climber's best interests,1
419,The device can't do that for you,1
420,#OkGumby,1
421,#OkGumby #OkGumby,1
422,Sheesh~ people...,1
423,There are a few Grigri type devices that do allow a bit of slippage~ the mad rock lifeguard being one,2
424,Mad rock also offers the Safeguard~ with no slippage~ for rescue and gym applications,2
425,"Problem is~ that ""lock even when the belayer drops dead"" thing is why people buy grigris or the like~ the ""hands off"" ""foolproof"" device~ and then stuff that Grigri into the hands of a totally inexperienced belayer...and wonder why things didn't go so swell",0
426,An on/off switch is an interesting idea...but then you're right back to the competence of the user,1
427,Overriding the cam is already a huge operator error,0
428,That slippage is probably best left to experience~ or~ pick how you belay carefully~ if you plan to blow out anchors regularly,1
429,I'm too lazy to hunt it up~ but Jim Titt has a spiffy chart showing how different devices lock~ or not~ the forces involved  And yes~ grigris are hard stop~ ATC and others less so,1
430,But it's a curve~ so more interesting than just hard and fast numbers,1
431,My guess is~ all the other factors will add up more than the belay device~ such as rope out~ drag~ climber/belayer weight~ terrain~ etc,1
432,I expect the other styles of assisted braking devices vary too~ there's a lot more on the market these days than ATC and Grigri,1
433,I've seen claims for the Alpine Up to auto lock~ unassisted~ but of course even Grigri instructions say use your brake hand,1
434,IIRC~ Munter and ATC are the gentlest~ but an experienced belayer that cares is still best~ IMO,1
435,By the way~ can too go past a vertical line on a less than vertical route~ way~ way past,1
436,Don't forget about climbing to one side or the other of that plumb line and setting yourself up for a nasty pendulum into whatever awaits beside you,1
437,Or~ ahead or behind~ on a traverse,1
438,Horizontal travel can nail you too,1
439,Best~ Helen,1
440,Having been dropped twice (outdoors trad~ with injuries)~ I’ll settle for just the catch...anything else is icing on the cake,1
441,Count me among the insane,1
442,Catching refrigerators with muscles too~ not skinny little pipsqueeks.,1
443,This is the “Leeroy Jenkins!!” post of the thread.,1
444,Your responses have been pretty absurd so far~ but now I am dying to see you demonstrate this master falling technique Gravity ONLY pulls down~ bud,1
445,So if it's not YOU pushing outward~ away from the vertical wall~ what is the force doing it? Or are you saying you DO push off~ deliberately~ to avoid grinding on the wall?,1
446,The climber fell out slightly from the wall then the rope came tight and she accelerated into the wall and twisted her ankle,1
447,I'm genuinely curious,1
448,Do you mean your climber bounced away from the wall and then you pulled her back in? If she was .5m,1
449,"or 1.5 feet~ roughly~ above a bolt~ I'm not sure a traditional ""soft catch"" would have made much difference",1
450,Those falls just above a bolt are often jarring,1
451,You're probably right about that,1
452,"It's worth noting that this is a thread that started with someone asking about creating a device to ""soft catch"" on Factor 2 falls",1
453,Which~ by definition~ only really happen in multipitch scenarios,1
454,Given that a belayer MUST be anchored for there to even be a fall factor 2 happening the whole debate about REAL soft catches (which~ again~ are a great trick in overhanging~ run-out situations to keep your climber from hitting the wall when they swing back) was sort of a non-sequitor,1
455,It's pretty hard to jump toward your falling climber when on a hanging belay at a multipitch anchor,1
456,The most bizarre soft catch dogma I've seen~ though~ was by certain testers at my gym when giving lead belay tests,1
457,"A person I know was failed on her lead belay test not because she failed to stop her climber or did anything wrong but because she didn't ""jump"" and give her climber a ""soft-catch"" on a juggy 5.10a climb that was dead vertical with lots of stuff sticking out of it",1
458,In other words~ not actually a place where a soft-catch is ideal,1
459,But this poor person is now likely to go through her entire climbing career thinking that you must ALWAYS jump when catching a fall or you're doing something wrong,1
460,I'm genuinely curious,1
461," Her fall pretty much described something between a semicircle and a ""J""~ where she popped off~ fell backwards then down",1
462,She yelled and I braced for the fall,1
463,As soon as her weight came onto the rope she accelerated and swung hard into the rock just a couple of feet below the bolt,1
464,I didn't move,1
465,I honestly don't recall what device I was using to belay.,1
466,I honestly don't recall what device I was using to belay,1
467,Well~ you caught her and she was okay~ so good work in the end,1
468,Thanks for answering,1
469,But that's the point that soft-catch advocates are trying to make: they don't have to be jarring~ because you can give a soft catch! Falls just above a bolt or gear are one of the places I'm more intentional about it for exactly that reason~ and such falls can be common if on well-protected routes at one's limit,1
470,I'm thinking of vertical or near-vertical walls here,1
471,It should go without saying~ but probably won't on this thread~ so to disclaim: no~ I won't do this if there's a ledge~ protrusion~ or the ground that the climber could hit,1
472,Is it always perfect? No~ but it usually works well and is better than the alternative~ particularly if the alternative is locking down hard.,1
473,Is it always perfect? No~ but it usually works well and is better than the alternative~ particularly if the alternative is locking down hard,1
474,"You are talking about comfort but the initial criticism that started this debate ""OMG never let that person belay you!"" was talking about safety.",1
475,I too aspire to be technically correct~ while completely missing the point and alienating everyone around me.,1
476,Don't be so hard on Artem.,1
477,So now we’ve gone from “a mysterious outward force nobody can explain” to “When falling we do often tilt backwards and we often kick off a bit...Pushing out is very common~ almost everybody does it~ despite those who spray otherwise”,1
478,i guess somebody explained it.,1
479,With all these hypothetical situations~ people are getting caught up on equipment as a substitute/crutch for skills,1
480,That goes for both the leader and belayer,1
481,Does anybody plan before they leave the ground??? If climbing at your limit~ you have an inkling of where the crux is and you’re within sight of your belayer~ do you talk about distance to the last piece of pro? how you might fall~ length of the fall~ risk of hitting a feature~ ground fall~ pendulums~ the amount of slack in the system and the type of catch~ etc??? All this jibber jabber makes me think not,1
482,If people expect a piece of equipment to make a fall “better” or “softer” or “safer”~ they’re fooling themselves and their partner,1
483,Sometimes a fall is a surprise..,1
484,that’s just climbing.,1
485," You are talking about comfort but the initial criticism that started this debate ""OMG never let that person belay you!"" was talking about safety",1
486,We must just have different ideas of what a soft catch is,1
487,That video is focused on what the climber should do~ rather than the belayer~ but most of the catches looked reasonably soft to me~ particularly given the nearness of the ground--on most of them the belayer went with the force of the fall and was pulled up in the air,1
488,(There's also a reference at one point to communicating with your belayer if possible so you can receive a softer catch.),1
489," It's already been said~ but this has become one of those ""team"" debates where people are more interested in their ""side"" winning than having a discussion where any of us could learn something",1
490,If someone wants to offer a clear explanation of the dynamics of a fall that justifies the use of a soft catch on a nonvertical slab~ I'm more than willing to be convinced.,1
491,Man it just gets better! Now you’ve moved from a vertical wall to a slab! Keep digging.,1
492,Nope: Vertical is at best a maybe~ slab is is a never.,1
493,Shit~ now it’s gonna be a quarry.,1
494,Nobody is arguing with that~ Charles,1
495,The belayer COULD have given his climber a softer catch if he had the timing and room to do so,1
496,That is true,1
497,"But he didn't and she wasn't ""spiked"" or injured or anything",1
498,"The actual proper ""soft catch"" technique isn't about comfort or because climbers are particularly fragile people",1
499,It's a deliberate technique to keep a climber on overhanging terrain from penduluming back into the rock~ often headfirst~ and not getting injured as a result,1
500,I’ve got 100’s-1000’s of falls taken and caught over 30ish years of climbing,1
501,And being pretty light~ often with a heavier belayer~ the difference in whether the belayer moves or not is incredibly obvious~ even on vertical walls.,1
502,This thread is great,1
503,It highlights the Dunning–Kruger effect very well,1
504,There are even people stating that they don't believe their lack of experience should factor in because the physics are simple to understand,1
505,As a climber that climbs 3 to 4 days a week on average for well over a decade~ I have a bit of experience,1
506,As an aerospace engineer~ I have a decent background in physics,1
507,I can tell you a good belay is complicated and requires skills and attentiveness,1
508," As my advanced dynamics teacher said~ ""Higher education is just a series of decreasing lies~ the higher you go the less we lie to you and the harder the math gets.""   The life long physics teacher was the only one in these 6 pages to say maybe he doesn't know everything",1
509,The arrogance of the inexperienced is always amazing,1
510,Man it just gets better! Now you’ve moved from unsafe to obvious! Keep digging,1
511,Yeah~ experience,1
512,I know people that are convinced that vaccines cause autism because of their very personal experience of raising a child with autism,1
513,I mean~ they've walked the walk..,1
514,You've got experience and credentials,1
515,Then can you give us a quick write up explaining the correct and appropriate situations for a soft catch? I'm particularly interested in why it would ever be necessary on slab~ since no one wants to go there.,1
516,Find one post of mine where I said not giving a soft catch was inherently unsafe,1
517,Of course it’s situational~ nobody is arguing that,1
518,When conditions don’t warrant softening the catch...duh~ don’t do it,1
519,But when they do~ yes it decreases the chance injury,1
520,And by “obvious” I mean specifically more likely to sprain/break an ankle.,1
521,And by “obvious” I mean specifically more likely to sprain/break an ankle,1

523,Then can you give us a quick write up explaining the correct and appropriate situations for a soft catch? I'm particularly interested in why it would ever be necessary on slab~ since no one wants to go there,1
524,It is apparent that you are missing the point of my post,1
525,You want this to be a simple thing someone can teach you in a 1000 or less character post,1
526,Only the truly inexperienced with a rudimentary understanding of physics think in this way,1
527,This is why you have the two camps talking past each other,1
528,I'm not talking about the fall Philip described specifically~ I'm taking issue with your suggestion that falls just above a bolt are often jarring,1
529,I don't think they need to be and in my experience usually aren't,1
530,I don't agree that there isn't sufficient timing and room to give a soft catch in such situations~ or that soft catches are limited to overhanging terrain,1
531,However~ as I said to Dave~ it may be that we have different ideas of what a soft catch is,1
532,Perhaps we agree more than we realize,1
533,That being said~ I just don't think these short falls usually need to be jarring at all~ which makes me wonder,1
534,We have crossed into that argument zone where it is now about who is saying the same thing better...,1
535,The topic was FF2 falls,1
536,Help me understand the soft catch process for FF2~ please? Slab~ vert or overhanging~ I don't care,1
537,Explain for me how to soft catch an FF2 with~ for example~ a grigri,1
538,Thank you!,1
539,Jesus~ you’re dense~ “inherently” would be ignoring all other factors~ like ledges and obstacles,1
540,You know very well nobody is advocating softening the catch even if it would add to the risk of hitting an obstacle,1
541,If those factors/obstacles don’t exist then~ yes~ I’m saying unequivocally~ softening the catch will result in fewer injuries on vertical to overhanging terrain,1
542,I’m making no statement as to whether this holds true for slabs.,1
543,I can clearly see the belayer giving the climber a soft catch~ in the same frame.,1
544,ZZZZzzz Clearly y'all need a hobby,1
545,That video looks like contrived bullshit and incompetent belaying to me,1
546,If you fall that far below your gear for only having it at your knee when the fall started - you WILL eventually hit something on the way down - and with a lot of force,1
547,It's just a matter of time,1
548," It's not rocket science to see this guy in particular would have fully cratered into the ground if he was a body length or more above that draw - hardly even a ""long"" run-out",1
549," This video nicely shows what NOT to do for a ""soft catch"".",1
550,Leron: do you know what a fall factor 2 fall is?,1
551,I think we agree more than you realize,1
552,"Yeah~ with 30 feet of rope and direct line of sight the belay COULD HAVE stepped forward or ""hopped"" or whatever to make it more comfortable",1
553,Or they could also not have,1
554,And~ in the end~ the climber was fine which is what matters most,1
555,"When I said~ ""often"" it's because it depends a lot on the angle of the climb (not jarring at all when you fall 1.5 feet past the bolt on a dead overhang) and~ most of all~ the amount of rope in the system",1
556,The primary source of give in the modern climbing system would be our dynamic ropes with their 30% impact stretch,1
557," My issue with the ""all catches should be soft catches"" line is that there's not even consensus about what is a soft catch",1
558,"Is it leaping into the catch? Is it leaning or stepping forward slightly forward and ""giving"" when it hits? Is it feeding slack or letting your brake hand slip on an ATC? I've heard all of those thrown about as the ""true"" soft catch",1
559,I appreciate a great dynamic belay,1
560,I've had a good soft catch save me from slamming into overhanging rock numerous times while sport climbing,1
561,Hooray for that,1
562,But if I'm 90 feet above you on a ledgy or juggy multipitch trad climb just CATCH me,1
563,I don't want anyone increasing the distance of my fall in that case by leaping or anything else,1
564,"My issue with the ""all catches should be soft catches"" line is that there's not even consensus about what is a soft catch",1
565,I think we're mostly talking past each other at this point,1
566,"Who on this thread is saying ""all catches should be soft catches"" or suggesting leaping on a juggy/ledgy multipitch? I'm certainly not~ and there's a wide spectrum between that and overhanging sport climbs",1
567,"Though I do agree with your implication that it would be helpful to define our terms--""soft catch""--before we debate these issues",1
568,I'm curious exactly what you do on a short fall on a clean vertical wall but I'm not sure I have the energy to keep discussing this!,1
569,"Who on this thread is saying ""all catches should be soft catches"" or suggesting leaping on a juggy/ledgy multipitch? Not you",1
570,Artem was essentially saying all catches should be soft catches,1
571,"He even has the ninja reflexes to ""soft catch"" someone past a ledge~ apparently",1
572,I want video of that because if it's true it's RAD.,1
573,Not you,1
574,Since I am bored - yes I agree that all catches should be soft,1
575,Of course~ if you hit a ledge or something else the catch stops being soft,1
576,Hence~  a soft catch is meant to prevent you hitting things/ledges/ground hard,1
577,See - definition of soft catch is not that hard.,1
578,Who cares about all this fall catching stuff,1
579,The most important quality of a belayer is whether they shame you appropriately for grabbing the rope at your tie in point when you fall,1
580,Lol I unfollowed this thread but keep seeing it pop back up on the recent threads table,1
581,Only MP can we go 7 pages arguing about something as simple as this,1
582,Any bets on how long we'll be beating this dead horse all while insulting each other virtually (as is the custom on the board)? I say this is headed straight for a page 10~ or maybe even 15.,1
583,I'll throw something else in here..,1
584,I'm the lighter partner~ and granted~ I don't lead much~ but I do fall lots and lots when I do~ lol,1
585,We pretty much always climb on my rope~ and my partners are usually heavier,1
586,Sometimes much heavier,1
587,"And yet~ no one has ever attempted a ""soft catch""~ and no catch I have had has ever been anything I'd object to",1
588,So why is that? Just beginners luck? Or~ would my rather stretchy newish rope make a difference? I know it adds a lot to the falls my big guys take if they peel (I keep that in mind~ especially close to the start)~ and they lose a fair amount of ground if they hang to ponder a move very long,1
589,So~ rope a factor in soft versus hard? I'm not talking static~ obviously~ just whatever rope you usually climb on,1
590,Just curious,1
591,By page 7 anything's fair game~ eh? Best~ Helen,1
592,I'm curious exactly what you do on a short fall on a clean vertical wall but I'm not sure I have the energy to keep discussing this! Well~ obviously bicarbonate of soda makes bread rise.,1
593,I don't know what Artem is climbing~ but MOST of the time I can't even see/hear the leader where I climb..,1
594,I climb mostly in the mountains(on trips)~ routes don't go straight up,1
595,My rope is springy enough thank you~ and there is always some slack in the system~ don't be giving me any more to allow me to hit a ledge,1
596,I usually outweigh my partners~ and am more concerned about bashing them into unconsciousness in a fall rather than getting the softest possible catch,1
597,Single pitch sport climbing is a different story~ soft catch away...I weigh > 200 lbs so I'll be pulling you right off your feet anyway,1
598,Helen~,1
599," A climbing partner of mine who is an actual rocket scientist (and who also gives great sport soft catches) once explained to me that if the weight difference between two parties is too much the concept of a ""soft catch"" doesn't really pencil out because whenever your weight (say 100 lbs) hits the end of the rope against 200 lbs the 100 lb delta on that causes you to just stop~ no matter what",1
600,And if the larger person happens to hop early and is coming back DOWN~ well~ then the jolt is even worse,1
601,So good thing we solved that problem with ropes that stretch 30%,1
602,One of my primary climbing partners weighs about 60 lbs less than me,1
603,She always gives me a soft catch~ even if she sits down when I'm falling,1
604,Safe but also no mercy.,1
605,Now I am going to say~ OP making a gri gri like you mentioned with a soft catch feature would be extremely difficult because the GriGri cams on the rope to stop it and there has to be so much force involved and then it is either an all or nothing cam,1
606,Soft catches are best given by the belayer themselves after they have read the situation and have the experience to know how soft to make the fall (it could be a hard catch or it could be a super soft catch depending on what best fits in the situation),1
607,And finally guys~ soft catches are something that we can all agree that no one can agree on,1
608,I have had soft catches on slabby climbs that have been quite nice~ and I have had soft catches on over hangs that have kinda sucked and I wished my belayed would have made it a hard catch,1
609,The moral of this story is which is better soft catch or hard catch is based purely on preference,1
610,They both have situations that can be dangerous and both have times when one would be better over the other~ but lots of the time either one works and as long as you are caught it doesn't really matter how it happened just that you didn't deck and that you didn't get decapitated on an overhanging ledge,1
611,Last thing~ throwing personal insults at other people's comments doesn't improve your own point,1
612,I personally am a fan of soft catches because I have hurt my back getting a hard catch before in the past~ but I can see the merit behind getting a hard catch in certain situations,1
613,So if I buy another rope I might want to consider this? Stick with a similar amount of elongation? At the very least~ I'd know what to expect,1
614,I've had the years long benefit of that physics guy on here patiently explaining stuff to the noob with endless questions...,1
615,I've had the years long benefit of that physics guy on here patiently explaining stuff to the noob with endless questions..,1
616,I recently switched over to Edelweiss ropes and love mine,1
617,It's 60M and has a bi-pattern to it,1
618,It has a great stretch amount for soft falls~ If you are looking for a new rope I would definitely recommend,1
619,I've broken several sets of trigger wires over the years - it seems the only BD-supported way to repair them is to send them in for service,1
620,The UL trigger wires seems flimsier,1
621,Has anyone come up with a way to replace these wires with something a bit more substantial?   I do recognize that these cams are as light as they are because they trimmed all the grams~ and the irony of thinking about doing anything to them that would increase weight,1
622,But the wires do seem to be a weak point~ and maybe worth adding a tiny bit more mass,1
623,yes~ i have fixed a dozen or so,1
624,i use a hand crimper tool from amazon,1
625,i stick with the same size wire rope to keep them light since the repair is easy.,1
626,I've replaced trigger wires on normal c4s with weed wacker line,1
627," 0.065"" worked for me~ but I'm not sure if it'll fit for the ultralights",1
628,Hey~ I was wondering what do you guys usually carry on your harness besides normal protection like quick draws or trad protection? My current rack for relatively short less than a day single and multi pitch climbing from left to right is: - 120cm sling for attaching light belayer,1
629,- 60cm sling for making a lanyard if needed,1
630,- Another 60cm sling for random use,1
631,Both have a small screw gate,1
632,-Two medium size HMS screw gates for anchoring etc,1
633,- Grigri,1
634,Good for climbing with single rope,1
635,Not that useful for double ropes or two followers,1
636,- 240cm sling for trad anchors,1
637,-Water bottle for long trad routes with a small screwgate,1
638,-ATC and two HMS screwgates for belay,1
639,-Ropeknife with a small screwgate,1
640,-Two prusik's with one small screwgate each,1
641,- Microtraction with a light HMS screwgate,1
642,-Two 120cm slings for self rescue and extending pieces etc.,1
643,Seems like a lot of redundancy,1
644,Youll know after a while what you use and dont use,1
645,Leave the stuff you dont use,1
646,Regardless of how much you bring~ itll just be weight training.,1
647,That’s for sure more than I carry,1
648,The only item that is 100% of the time consistently on my harness regardless of what kind of multipitch I’m doing is a wiregate with a very small amount of athletic tape around the spine~ (for ‘locking’ non-locking carabiners) a Hollowblock~ a tiny knife~ and a microtrax,1
649,Everything else depends on the larger context of the route~ but is usually some variation of this: 120cm dyneema sling on a single locker for general use Single belay device,1
650,(Usually a camp ovo with two lockers or a grigri with one) Single locker for cloving in or a dedicated tether with locker if rope-solo-seconding,1
651,1 anchor setup per person (usually a 240cm dyneema sling or a cordalette) Sometimes I have an extra wiregate for the microtrax if I’m hauling pitches on a free climb  Everything else (Prussiks~ extra slings~ lockers~ etc,1
652,is redundant or better carried in a small pack,1
653,(Water),1
654,Wow,1
655,I think I counted 14 lockers in that photo you posted,1
656," If this is your rack for ""relatively short days~"" i.e",1
657,less than a full day~ it seems like way too much to me,1
658,I'd carry 3 lockers~ maybe 4~ haha,1
659,Don't forget yer nut tool,1
660,Sport climbing the only thing I take is a Grigri.,1
661,All of your stuff could get used on some route or other,1
662,On one hand what you choose to carry is your affair~ even if its more than you strictly need,1
663,So whatever you want~ to a large extent.On the other load yourself too much and you might not be able to squeeze through that chimney and you may get to the end of every pitch of the route with most of that shit still hanging there on your harness~ unused,1
664,If you didn't use it you didn't need it,1
665,Try eliminating any piece of gear you didn't use on your last outing~ if you want,1
666,I prefer to strip optional gear out of the equation.,1
667,Why not rappel on your gri gri and pass on both of the prusik's :)? I used to bring pruskiks too~ but then i started using my 60cm slings as a prusiks,1
668,They're not as smooth~ but since i don't prusik regularly I don't mind,1
669,I also bring 2x 120cm slings but i have mine on Camp nano 22 wire gate carabiners and can't say that i've ever wished they were lockers.,1
670,If using a plate style device~ there's definitely no need for more than three lockers (one for atc/one for guide mode masterpoint/one for your tether/clove),1
671,If you're climbing runout routes where a single protection point failure (i.e,1
672,freak accident of biner becomes unclipped) you can always double up opposite opposed nonlockers.,1
673,Yeah uh oh there's 16 lockers in the pic,1
674,Yikes :D Yeah I know it's overkill,1
675,That's why I asked,1
676,I do take beginners to climb quite often and they regularly forget their stuff on the ground,1
677,That's the reason for the extra HMS biner and extra prusik~ but yeah I do carry way too many small srewgates,1
678,-Nut tool goes in the nut rack or I give it to the second,1
679,-I usually choose to carry either Grigri or ATC,1
680,They both really good in their own way,1
681,-I have one wiregate dedicated for shoes and chalk,1
682,Maybe I should put that another prusik and knife and the water bottle there.,1
683,Instead of prussiks and extra slings~ I include two nylon slings as a part of 2 of my alpine draws,1
684,These work as prussiks and won't melt if you use them as a third hand,1
685,I think a lot of your extra slings are redundant if you consider that every alpine draw can be broken down into a sling for whatever off-nominal issue comes up,1
686,Definitely a lot of lockers on your rack,1
687,I've had much fewer when carrying everything with two newbie climbers,1
688,By my count~ all you need is: 1) Lower anchor master point locker 2) Personal clove hitch locker 3&4) ATC lockers 5) Upper anchor master point locker (since you'll need enough to build 2 anchors at a time for multi pitch) And then I bring 2x 240 cm slings to make both anchors.,1
689," ""Wiregate with a very small amount of athletic tape around the spine."" Why not carry one small screwgate instead? What carabiner do you use with the microtrax? A dedicated one or just some random one? ""Hollowblock~ a tiny knife and camp ovo"" These would be nice",1
690,"""Sometimes I have an extra wiregate for the microtrax if I’m hauling pitches on a free climb"" Is this for redundancy?",1
691,Interesting thread --- I like the idea of reducing lockers but bringing tape to backup lockers,1
692,For me at least~ I think of the slings + wiregates as belonging with the protection/leader,1
693,Seems like you can lose the dedicates prussiks in favor of slings in a rescue scenario.,1
694,Okay so I shaved about 325 grams,1
695,I do plan for rescue if someone needs one,1
696,Not necessary for the ultimate lightest setup~ but too much is too much..,1
697,This is the extra I shaved off,1
698,Yeah It's true that I can just break down alpine draws if I need 60 slings.,1
699,It really depends on the area and type of climbing doing,1
700,Sport:  if there's permadraws already hung~ its probably overhanging,1
701,So ill normally carry one or two draws and a hollow block cord,1
702,This allows me to boink up the rope easier~ by using a draw as handle,1
703,If it's more vertical I'll carry a belay device~ Hollow block~ anchor setup~ bail biner~ nut tool (has a built in wrench) For sport multipitch I add to the above gear a micro trax and a small pully,1
704,Trad multipitch: Belay device~ anchor setup~ 5-6 extra wiregate biners~ 2- D shape lockers~ 2 pear shaped lockers~  nut tool~ hollow block~ left hand ascender~ pully~ u ascend~  5 meters-7mm anchor cord,1
705,(At least I think it's 5m...)  Hell there's probably something else I'm forgetting!,1
706,As others have said~ it seems like an awful lot of stuff..,1
707,My extras generally are: A PAS with a locker~ but that is because I've used one for a while and am just used to it,1
708,It I were starting over I would use a simpler personal tether (1 locker),1
709,Either a pre-tied quad (if there are bolted anchors) or a long cordalette (trad) either of them with 4 lockers (5 total),1
710,My Alpine Smart with a spare locker for guide mode belaying (there are 2 more lockers~ so 7 total)),1
711,An ATC on a locker for multipitch just in case (funny~ I have never dropped my main device but I have dropped my back-up ATC~ so now 8 lockers),1
712,A nut tool~ but only for trad routes (comes with a tether and clip),1
713,A water bottle for multipitch or if I am belaying from the top on a hot day (non-locker).,1
714,Why so much? Are you hauling?,1
715,Give as much weight as possible to the follower~ they are on top rope,1
716,You are leading,1
717,I bring:,1
718,Okay so now this should be good enough,1
719,Seven Lockers one wiregate,1
720,Optional Grigri prusik and 120 sling.,1
721,What is the micro trax for? Have you ever needed to use it? I mean I don't take beginners out often but I carry way~ way less than is shown in even your updated image here,1
722,Do you regularly use all of these things?,1
723,Why even five? I have one for my ATC/grigri~ one for anchoring myself~ and one or two for misc,1
724,use,1
725,I have to double up non lockers sometimes~ but not terribly often,1
726,That being said~ there is a point where the convenience of having a little more stuff is worth some more weight.,1
727,A rescue can be improvised~ only bring a microtrax if you plan on hauling your partner up,1
728,Skip the tethers if you're with a competent partner~ if you're bringing up an non leading second on a multipitch they can carry their own tether~ if they can't remember that they can't really be trusted to belay,1
729,And to answer the question 1 Dmm boa masterpoint 1 attache for atc + 1 superlight locker 1 dmm sentinal for my grigri I will have water on a locking biner but it's extremely rare that I'd be hanging it off my harness (250m routes in the scorching heat)  If sport climbing i will literally have 1 draw on me after I've put up the draws.,1
730,Lets see: -one 240cm sling w/locker & one cordalette w/locker for belays -one belay device (usually tube) w/locker or grigri -one hollow block and gloves on mini biner,1
731,-pas or sling -couple extra light weight biners for bolted anchors -water bottle for long routes -LaSpo TX2 for descent if walk off -nut tool for follower~ so sometimes I carry it,1
732,I can think of a few situations where 4 is what I'd want,1
733,One extra for piece of mind,1
734,Agreed,1
735,I will say that I almost run out of things often~ and have to improvise maybe 5%-10% of the time,1
736,IMO~ that's the point: to go as light and simply as possible without being a pain in my ass,1
737,If I am consistently using all of the things on my harness on most pitches while still able to deal with any emergencies that arise~  I feel like my system is appropriate,1
738,Holy crap ya'll bring a lot of gear,1
739,What are the grigris for? I can see if you are projecting at your limit~ but you'll want an ATC-like device anyway,1
740,A guide mode tube works for self-rescue applications and is way more versatile,1
741,Full day trad: DMM Pivot + locker for belay 120cm or 240cm sling on a small locking biner (Spirit) Hollow block 2-3 small wire-gate biners Nut tool Maybe a small knife with a little tape (rarely~ unless tat is expected~ etc) Chalk bag (sling is an emergency prussik) Phone if reception or for topo (1 per group) as needed Of course water~ and a small bar~ if needed...,1
742,Ok I'll play,1
743,Only 3 things live permanently on my harness.,1
744,Well honestly I haven't needed the Microtrax for a real rescue situation,1
745,It's purpose is for rescuing unconscious leader(or a follower) where I have to fix the rope to the belay anchor and ascend up the rope to the leader and haul him to a new anchor I've just made,1
746,Also handy for hauling the follower over the crux,1
747,I do use them all quite regularly,1
748,You need one HMS per second to tie them in with a clove hitch,1
749,So If you have for example three seconds then you need three extra HMS screwgates,1
750,It's however newer happened that all three followers forgot their tie in biners on the ground,1
751,Small srewgates,1
752,Yeah I'have newer used them all at once but they are quite handy for making bomber anchors and threads and a attaching lanyards etc,1
753,I guess they could be replaced with wiregates.,1
754,For sport climbing multipitches I carry: The right amount of quickdraw Reverso + 2 screwgates PAS + screwgate Prussik 2 x 1.20 meters slings each with 2 regular biners Quicklink and a couple of random biners  Climbing knife I don't do much pure trad climbing but for alpine climbing I add: No PAS (I use the rope) No knife (Leatherman Crunch in the backpack) A few nuts Full set of cams (or less depending on the route) Switch the quickdraws for alpine quickdraws A bunch of slings + biners 1 cordelette Microtraxion + oval biner Ice screws if needed Crevasse rescue kit if needed,1
755,Typical Yosemite route between 500-1500 ft for me 5 Miniwire Quickdraws 4-5 skinny Dyneema Alpine Draws 1 120cm Dyneema (only if rapping or I need it for a particular placement) 2 lightweight lockers 1 grigri 2 1 atc 1 nut tool with prussik on a non-locker 2 quads made from 240cm dyneema with miniwires (if not in a hurry) 1 Edelrid Spoc (for self rescue~ photo jugging~ or impromptu simuling) Spare wiregate for shoes spare wiregate for bike bottle,1
756,Bong? I don't see a bong.,1
757,Thats alot of stuff,1
758,For a standard multipitch trad route I carry: - a GriGri on a locker OR an atc guide device plus two lockers -prusik on a wiregate -knife and tibloc on a locker -if its off the beaten path~ I will bring a cordalette on a wiregate I have no need for all of the extra slings,1
759,Half of my alpine draws use nylon runners~ so I can use them for prusiks or cut them and sling small trees,1
760,As for the lockers~ you only need a couple (for your belay devices and emergency ascender),1
761,I use non lockers for pretty much everything else.,1
762,What actually goes with me on every climb lives in and on this sweet Tufa chalk bag:,1
763,yeah~ that's definitely a lot of stuff,1
764,i typically have a belay device and biner (either grigri or light ATC type)~ a nut tool that has a wiregate~ a prussik clipped in the nut tool's wire gate~ and two or maybe 3 light lockers for anchors,1
765,sometimes i will substitute my trango shark knife/nut tool for my usual nut tool,1
766,"i also have a 9 foot doubled piece of 1/2"" webbing for my chalkbag~ and another one for the belt of my pants",1
767,i definitely cringe at your water bottle setup,1
768,i have almost been taken out from above by 2 water bottles like that which came loose,1
769,it would be better to take about a foot of webbing and then a handfull of wraps of duct tape around the bottle.,1
770,This is nuts dude,1
771,Sport climbing i have A chalk bag and 1 draw,1
772,The belayer has a grigri a glove and belay goggles,1
773,Trad 3 120s on a single biner each~ for extension threads anchors...many uses,1
774,In the pocket of my chalkbag a tiny knife~ a tiny elight a single rolled rap ring and a tiblock (which is my sole nicety in my mind)  a reverso/ belay plate and 3 lockers one locker has a 6mm aramid rap cord,1
775,We belay with a grigri (Edit) if we are hauling a bag or leading a clean wall with no wind,1
776,We will bring a mirco and a 6mm or so aramide 65mm tag line to haul a small bag~ for shoes food water clothes ect,1
777,Somtimes  we will fix  the line and follow the pitch on a mirco while the leader hauls,1
778,In the scenario we each have a little more gear,1
779,Your rack has x number of alpines/draws Plus wires and cams ect plenty to draw from if you need to make more complex systems,1
780,You do not need more than 3 lockers What does plan for rescue mean? Its called improvised rescue,1
781,You dont need a SAR level redundancy.,1
782,Why so much? Are you hauling? Reading through the rest of this thread has made me realize I carry to much shit,1
783,However the non lockers are used to rack everything else~ and one pear shaped locker goes with the belay device,1
784,Leaving 1 pear for the master point and a D shaped locker to tie into,1
785,I have done few courses that included rescuing scenarios in various levels,1
786,Those all have a list's of equipment one need to have,1
787,So you plan and practice that rescue scenario beforehand,1
788,For example could be a scenario where you are rescuing an unconscious leader,1
789,I don't know about the term improvised rescue,1
790,Is it an American thing?,1
791,It's more of an experience thing - it's not specific to a nationality,1
792,In those courses you took pretty much every piece of gear can be substituted using other gear~ or a slightly different technique,1
793,Rescues can be done safely and effectively with pretty much nothing more than what you need to lead a typical pitch of trad~ and a few lockers.,1
794,Is it an American thing? The likelihood of needing any of that is near 0%,1
795,I have done it and its not so bad,1
796,But if you have aramide cord or a really long hollow block you can rappel a weighted line with the valdeton tresse,1
797,Its an arborism technique but applies wholesale to climbing,1
798,My normal personal gear for a few to many pitches of trad is: 3 lockers (one to clove hitch myself to the anchor~ two for guide mode on my belay device) 2 non-locking biners 2 double length slings (anchors) Petzl reverso Bail biner which holds: Nut tool~ pirahna knife~ and a 5mm prusik cord Chalk bag Optional: food~ water~ phone~ extra layers (down jacket~ rain shell)~ roll of climbing tape (dual purpose for medical use and repairs)~ approach shoes Optional x2: extra webbing if I expect I might bail and/or have unmaintained rappels I will cannibalize protection (slings~ biners~ etc) as needed to make an anchor if my two slings aren't ideal~ and also leave slings/gear behind in the event of a bail/emergency.,1
799," Ditto the ""Holy crap!"" comments!!! Most anchors are tied together with the rope and tie ins are simple clove hitch to locking biner",1
800,All slings~ doubles etc are part of the total gear avalable for leading~ anchors etc,1
801,I don't carry any extra slings for dedicated personal use,1
802,Generally use the first one cleaned when following as shoulder sling to rack cleaned gear,1
803,This is faster at belays than de-racking from harness,1
804,When it comes time to multi pitch rappel~ slings are tasked as personal tether and rappel device extension Dedicated personal gear: -ATC or ATC guide with HMS autolock biner -hollowblock or prussik and small locker for third hand or rescue -2-3 light lockers -nut tool -chalk bag with small pair EMT scissors in side pocket -bail biner doubles for hanging descent shoes -sometimes a water bottle -snacks in pants pockets,1
805,Lockers are pretty much luxury items,1
806,I do always bring a munter biner for belaying / rappelling either with a hitch or atc,1
807,Everything else can be done with biners on the rack,1
808,I add more lockers for specific climbs where they will make things more efficient or lighter.,1
809,"Is it an American thing? ""Improvised rescue"" simply means to self-rescue without the assistance of an outside SAR group.",1
810,You put lockers on the bolt or gear ends of your anchors? I just use wiregates like with every other piece of gear I clip on a route,1
811,The only locker goes on the masterpoint,1
812,So my lockers would be: 1 small one for personal anchor,1
813,Belay device locker (I use a Mammut smart alpine)~ one more for masterpoint,1
814,If I run out I just use opposite and opposed wiregates,1
815,It really comes down to what you think needs a locker,1
816,I dont build anchors with lockers just 2 super light wire gates and if it's a 3 point then a cam has a racking carabiner,1
817,So for me it's just 3 lockers,1
818,Belay device locker guide mode locker clove hitch locker,1
819,If I bring a micro T it gets a locker,1
820,If I'm bringing shoes they go in a pack,1
821,If I'm rapping then no shoes,1
822,Nut tool and prussic go on 1 wire gate,1
823,Instead of a knife I taped a razor in a helmet (taped up and angled so I can't get cut) chalk bag on wire gate too,1
824,If I bring water its in a pack (Camelback is great to drink and belay)  or the follower carries it,1
825,I could lose a lot of weight with lightweight shoes,1
826,Gotta find some I like for cheap...,1
827,Multi-pitch Trad setup: - Grigri with auto locker as main belay device for both leader and (especially) follower- HMS screwgate to tether my climbing rope tie in to the anchor- Reverso and hollow block stored on old non-locking bail biner for rappels / emergencies - 2 more auto lockers to set up a fixed-point lead belay~ rap with Reverso~ use as master point with girth hitch/clove hitch/rap ring anchors~ etc,1
828,- double length sling on non-locker- triple length sling on non-locker - nut tool- water bottle on shock cord (Gatorade ftw!)So 4 lockers total~ including 1 on the grigri,1
829,3 are auto locking~ mostly because I've had a couple screwgates jam closed on me,1
830,Exception is the HMS I use to tether myself~ which is a screw gate so I can clip it one handed,1
831,For single pitch trad I'll leave behind the triple length sling and water,1
832,For sport climbing I'll also leave behind the nut tool and one of the spare auto lockers~ but keep the Reverso/hollow block~ and double length sling in case I find myself needing to rap,1
833,For my anchors I try and use minimal gear and minimal knots favouring girth/clove hitches instead~ especially if it's a hanging belay,1
834,If I can clip a big auto locker onto a beefy backed up ring anchor~ that's my first choice for a master point,1
835,For 2-bolt anchors I'll use the rope to clove the first with my HMS and clip a bowline on a bight to the second bolt as my master point (banshee belay),1
836,For 3 point Trad anchors I'll use the double length sling to equalize 2 pieces with a girth hitch~ clove hitch my tie in to that~ then clove hitch the third piece with the back side of my tie-in,1
837,This assumes we're swinging leads,1
838,If we're block leading I'm more likely to use the double or triple length sling in a more conventional quad anchor~ pre-equalized~ or banshee belay setup~ but I really try and avoid busting out the triple length sling whenever possible - it's just too much material.,1
839,Put your device back on a gear loop and never rack it again,1
840,I have:,1
841,Post coffee post..,1
842,..,1
843,my standard set up is two alpine runners with lockers; this stays on my right rear gear loop~ next to my belay device~ at all times unless it's actively being used--ask me why,1
844,On long routes I shoulder the slings~ gear loop the lockers~ and rack a cordellette.,1
845,Why?,1
846,So my lockers would be: 1 small one for personal anchor,1
847,That's exactly what I do.,1
848,That's exactly what I do,1
849,In addition to the time: the weight~ and the fact that they're different from the rest of the biners you're carrying so you end up with 'specialized' biners that can only go one place~ vs a biner that can be used for almost any purpose,1
850,I think carrying multipurpose gear is ideal.,1
851,This is a small detail,1
852,I put a couple wraps of tape around my folding knife to keep it from accidentally opening,1
853,Tape could then be used for locking a non-locker.,1
854,My current setup: -Cordalette + Locker (+1 more for other climber) -Locker for Clove-Hitching in -GriGri+ Locker -Nut tool (+1 more for other climber) -Knife -Hollow-block + locker -ATC + locker for rapping/backup Opportunities for weight savings: consolidating to just ATC for some climbs~ going from 5 -> 3 lockers.,1
855," ""I don't have a problem with lockers per se~ but I do have a problem with the time and effort that goes into constantly locking and unlocking them~ and double checking whether they are locked..."" +1 Every climb I have",1
856,1 twist lock HMS for belay biner with belay device~ 1 autolock for tether/master point biner runner length 6mm prussic and mini biner in chalk bag pocket---      teeny tiny multitool (about 1 1/2 inches long with scissors~ nail file and knife)      nuts and washers (for bolts with the hanger stolen to use with wired nut)      cut off toothbrush trad add---      nut tool      pink tri cam if using someone else's rack multi-pitch add---      aaa light in pants pocket      double runner in 6.5 mm dynamic cord on oval wiregate,1
857,I have seriously considered carrying a pink tricam in my chalk bag pocket.,1
858,you should know how to Munter~ then you could skip the belay plate if your main belay is the gri gri,1
859,Hell~ if it's bolted anchors you could skip all the belay devices and just use a munter,1
860,Always: Nut Tool + Wiregate ATC + HMS Locker Prussik + Locker Double length sling + Locker Optional: Additional double length sling + HMS Water  Snack Webbing  Knife Beer,1
861,I don't have a problem with lockers per se~ either~ but just don't see why they'd be at all useful on the gear of an anchor,1
862,We trust our lives to non-locking biners every time we are leading above any piece of gear or a quickdraw~ right? So what is special about an anchor that it'd require lockers on three different pieces for gear with a primarily downward angle of pull? Plus the gear already has racking biners,1
863,Just seems like a lot to carry and extra time and effort as you correctly note,1
864,The only place I really feel like a locker is required would be on my belay device and on a rappel device,1
865,You only need 3 lockers,1
866,2 for a guide mode atc and 1 for your clove hitch,1
867,If you want to extend and back up your rappels~ you have the 3 lockers needed (for sling tether~ ATC~ and autoblock),1
868,Optional locker on your shoes or water bottle if you’re doing a chimney or something,1
869,Voila Also if you’re carrying your shoes~ put stuff  in them! Why carry a knife on a locker when you could just put it in your empty shoe,1
870,Throw Some food in there too,1
871,Why? After leaving the ground without it I was forced to Munter down Kern Slab: not fun~ slightly disruptive~ and embarrassing!,1
872,After reading Touching the Void I no longer carry a knife; I do carry six lockers including my belay though...,1
873,For a multi pitch trad climb I carry : Grigri on a locker Atc on a locker Prusik on a locker double length sling on a locker or Lockerdraw  cordlette on non locker and / or Long thin dyneema sling on non locker One extra non locker Knife~ headlamp on a toy biner,1
874,If you carry a Grigri and a microtraxion there is no need for prusik loops,1
875,Each can be used as an ascender if needed,1
876,Unless your one of the safety concerned people who like backing up a grigri,1
877,I don't have a problem with lockers per se~ either~ but just don't see why they'd be at all useful on the gear of an anchor,1
878,The only place I really feel like a locker is required would be on my belay device and on a rappel device,1
879,I try not to trust my life to any single piece of gear when leading,1
880,If a piece fails I should be caught by the next piece,1
881,It may mean significant injury but not death.,1
882,That's why I also carry the knowledge of how to tie a knot,1
883,It adds some weight~ but I think it's worth it.,1
884,It may mean significant injury but not death,1
885,I'm with you on that~ but you're not trusting your life to a single piece of gear when using regular carabiners on the anchor pieces of a 3 piece anchor~ either,1
886,I typically use a locker as a master point biner but if I'm ever short one I'm also happy to use a couple opposite and opposed regular biners,1
887,I'm with you on that~ but you're not trusting your life to a single piece of gear when using regular carabiners on the anchor pieces of a 3 piece anchor~ either,1
888,On multi you get one at master-point: top rope two of any kind I have handy,1
889,Thanks for all the answers,1
890,Keep them coming,1
891,:) It's interesting how everyone seem to have a bit different setup like their own flavor and no one have it exactly the same,1
892,I now realise that my setup is so bulky because I regularly climb with two or three newbies who have no own eqipment or skils to use it,1
893,I guess this is not that normal practise,1
894,What comes to belay it's kind of like rope solo climbing because they either newer belayed before or have limited experice with it,1
895,I do climb easy enough not to fall and easy enough for people who have newer climbed trad or rock before,1
896,With a competend partners I take a lot less,1
897,With leaders better than my level I tend to be very consiuos with weight,1
898,I just take the belay/rappeling equipment and a nut tool,1
899,I'll be cleaning after them anyway,1
900,For the upcomimg weekend trip I'm going to take the mp's advice and try to climb with less,1
901,I understand less is sometimes more,1
902,More climbing meters with less weight,1
903,How is this looking?,1
904," If you know a climb has ""traditional anchors"" (talking bolts here) ie 2 bolts in vertical orientation with.a chain connecting them and a single rap ring you can carry a single locker as your entire anchor just clip it to the ring and bam master point",1
905,Then just clip your clove and belay device to that masterpoint locker and Bob's your uncle,1
906,For that kinda anchor ultralight gear would be 1 locker for master point 1 locker and belay device (only 1 device ie mega July or grigri on the anchor for me) 1 locker for guide mode and prussic with my nut tool So that's 4 lockers 1 belay device nut tool and prussic ona wire gate,1
907,No cord or slings.,1
908,When I was a brand new rookie fireman still wet behind the ears I soaked up all the advice I could get from the older fireman,1
909,The thing I quickly realized when it came to equipment and tools that were ”essential“ to carry in my fire coat and pants is that if I took everyone’s advice I would soon be carrying 50lbs of extra crap that various salty fireman deemed essential,1
910,While all were well meaning and all the tools and gear served a purpose I obviously didn’t need ALL of it and I paired my essentials down to what suited me and the areas I worked,1
911,The same goes for climbing~ take in all the advice but pair it down to YOUR essentials,1
912,I had to read this few times,1
913,I don't know about Bob D: but yeah this is the best method,1
914,I always feel like why would you build an anchor from sligs on top of the perfectly good and superduper solid anchor,1
915,For top roping ofcource but for stand there is no need to do that,1
916,It's quite usual that there's two rings and I've heard that top one is good for connecting devices and the bottom is meant for rope,1
917,Side note,1
918,For groups more than three the masterpoint locker is a very good idea,1
919,You run out of space if you try connect everyone to that top ring.,1
920,After reading Touching the Void I no longer carry a knife; I do carry six lockers including my belay though..,1
921,After reading Touching the Void I have learnt how to pass a knot..!,1
922,After reading Touching the Void I have learnt how to pass a knot..! o.O,1
923,That looks like a very reasonable kit at the moment~ and significantly pared down from what you first posted,1
924,Aside from the rack~ I take a double length sling for personal anchor/anchor material on a locker and an ATC on a locker,1
925,Also~ one extra locker for guide mode,1
926,I've used this set up for many years and never wished I had more gear on me,1
927,Some of this gear we use every time~ some of it we use as insurance,1
928,It's like a monthly budget~ we all have to buy groceries but do we need to buy the AAA roadside assistance? You don't need it until you need it,1
929,If we do need it you'll l be glad you have it~ but some never will need it.,1
930,Yes~ but I wonder if bringing a micro-trax and so many additional slings is equivalent to also carrying spare alternator belt~ two spare tires~ etc,1
931,- One HMS locker for anchoring myself,1
932,- grigri with locker for belaying / rappelling,1
933,- Chalk bag with 6mm cord as belt (doubles as friction hitch cord) Everything else can be accomplished using whats on the rack.,1
934,I like to reduce the amount of carabiners on my harness that don't get used,1
935,I'll put my rappel prusik in a pocket or stuffed in shoes instead of on the harness,1
936,Instead of using a carabiner for shoes I tie the laces through my haul loop,1
937,I use a $1 gas station cheapo knife with a 3mm keeper loop that's super light and have one wrap of tape to keep it shut,1
938,Nut tool is the kind with an integrated clip gate instead of requiring a dedicated carabiner,1
939,As others have posted~ a small amount of tape is useful for locking nonlockers when bailing,1
940,Some folks use cord to tie a chalk bag belt~ which ensures that you always have a little extra material if you need to bail,1
941," Felt it worth commenting on the ""we'll use the rack"" notion",1
942,(Not calling out Buster in particular on this one; his kit seems to have taken this into account.),1
943,But depending upon where you are driving that might not be a bad idea..,1
944,do we keep it in the truck all the time or take it in and out of the garage depending on the trip..,1
945,so many decisions in life!,1
946,But depending upon where you are driving that might not be a bad idea..,1
947,so many decisions in life! To every thing~ there is a season!,1
948,The longer I climb the lighter it gets,1
949,Often just a grigri on a locker~ a nut tool~ and a couple wire gates,1
950,Water bottle and a wind breaker if the climb is longer/might get windy and cold,1
951,Swing leads a build anchors with the rope~ or an alpine draw,1
952,Clove hitch in on a wire gate,1
953,If its hard finger cracks I might bring a little tape,1
954,If it's sketchy climbing and we're gonna climb on two ropes for a pitch I'll bring an atc,1
955,If it's a long climb with involved rappells in the alpine I'd carry my emergency knife for sure.,1
956,Ditch 2 of the lockers and combine the slings and cord on a single biner,1
957,Then it's perfect.,1
958,if you own an old Land Rover or heck even a new one carrying a spare alternator and belts as well as a fuel pump ain’t a bad idea,1
959,^^Ahhhh~ everyone would agree that it would be stupid to carry anything you don’t need on a climb....the trick is to have the experience to know ahead of time what that minimum is Everybody gets it wrong one way or the other sometime,1
960,Early on you’ll likely carry too much~ later on you may be caught short as you thin your margins,1
961,It’s a fine line to surf~ But in general~ less is more.,1
962,if you own an old Land Rover or heck even a new one carrying a spare alternator and belts as well as a fuel pump ain’t a bad idea,1
963,That's because LR's are a POS.,1
964,When climbing trad you already probably have everything you might need in an emergency in your rack already,1
965,Use your runners if you need to make friction hitches,1
966,Use biners if you drop your rap device,1
967,Two wiregates are as good as a locker,1
968,Etc,1
969,"As a side note~ it's funny that people on MP make such a big deal out of carrying ""too many"" lockers",1
970,If a few lockers are weighing you down~ maybe you need to get some modern ones,1
971,I carry midsized screwgates which are only 50g a piece,1
972,Grivel makes a tiny screwgate that weighs 37g - that's about the same weight as a BD hoodwire or a WC helium,1
973,One think I always have on my harness while sport climbing: bail biners! Whatever old snapgates I have in my gear bin.,1
974,True the weight doesn't make much difference and you can always use a locker as a nonlocker by not locking it~ but that just feels wrong.,1
975,Tell me honestly~ though,1
976,Have you ever seen someone carrying 10 lockers who is carrying the modern ones? I see (and have been guilty myself of this) people putting their gloves on a 90 gram locker,1
977,And their cordellete on a 90 gram locker,1
978,And their shoes on a 90 gram locker...,1
979,It adds up quick,1
980,When I sat down and tried to figure out the very best way to shave a lot of weight off everything I carried it came down to switching from old BD racking and alpine draw carabiners that were 43 grams each to Nano 22s,1
981,The 21 grams each savings x approx 40 carabiners total adds up to nearly two lbs,1
982,Same goes for reducing the # of big lockers you carry,1
983,That was me too~ although not with lockers...shoes on an old BD oval~ chalk bag~ BD oval~ nut tool~ EMS oval...all those oversized biners were heavy,1
984,But since I am carrying around about twenty pounds of extra fat~ that weight seems to pale in comparison LOL,1
985,Hell~ if it's bolted anchors you could skip all the belay devices and just use a munter I saw a Swiss couple at RRG using Munters and they were onsighting 13’s,1
986,It f***s the rope a bit but you can always run the kinks out,1
987,The Munter is as basic a skill as a rethreaded 8 and 90% of climbers don’t know it.,1
988,I experience is that this mindset pervades all of their choices in climbing.,1
989,(Not calling out Buster in particular on this one; his kit seems to have taken this into account.),1
990,This is very similar to how I got by rope back Saturday,1
991,The more you know the less you need.,1
992,This is very similar to how I got by rope back Saturday  Also how I unstuck someone's rope on a multi descent as I had passed their snag on rappel,1
993,They lacked this skill though the had the tools.,1
994,All the more reason to replace your chalk bag cord with a little bit of 5mm rope,1
995,Hey~ I just launched a kickstarter for a new hangboard design,1
996,I'm curious if y'all have any feedback - we can still do minor edits to our design before our full production run,1
997,Thanks!,1
998,Nice! That looks slick! Very cool for apartment-dwellers who are scared of drilling or ripping down their door frame,1
999,Could you make a picture that shows edge sizes and hold configurations (i.e,1
1000,2 finger pocket~ 3 finger pocket~ 4 finger edge~ sloper~ jug)? EDIT: Also~ could other hang boards be mounted easily to this setup? Perhaps you could make a tier with just the mounting system sans-board for those who already have a board?,1
1001,This looks like a great idea and could fit a need for a lot of people,1
1002,Board almost might have too many hold options,1
1003,I really like how the newer tension board just gives you a pull up rung~ 30 mm holds down to 8 mm; no pockets~ no frills,1
1004,What about making your door mount compatible with most hangboards? Just a thought,1
1005,Good luck!,1
1006,Are the pinches interchangeable? Could I mount a plastic hold instead of the wooden pinch?,1
1007,You would have to modify the board a bit~ but it would be relatively easy to do,1
1008,We actually mail the boards without inserts epoxied in yet (we include epoxy with the shipment),1
1009,Do you have a specific type of pinch in mind?,1
1010,Do you have a specific type of pinch in mind? Looking at using either a half dome or a rectangle pinch block,1
1011,With the rectangle~ would like to have ability to change the mounting angle so I can practice different pinch angles.,1
1012,Can you explain the value of having 3 different 30/20mm flat holds? If you want to train two fingers instead of three or four~ can't you just do that on a bigger edge? This is what I think some of the newer boards get right (e.g,1
1013,tension): more edge sizes~ fewer gimmicky pockets.,1
1014,Great idea! I'd love it if I could buy just the mounting mechanism (very creative)~ and not the hangboard (would prefer to use my own),1
1015,Any chance you guys will sell the mount separately?,1
1016,Can you explain the value of having 3 different 30/20mm flat holds? If you want to train two fingers instead of three or four~ can't you just do that on a bigger edge? This is what I think some of the newer boards get right (e.g,1
1017,tension): more edge sizes~ fewer gimmicky pockets,1
1018,Why not just leave some open space on each end and put T nuts there so users can add a pair of holds of their choosing? It would be best if the holds were mirror opposites~ but I guess you can't have it all,1
1019,(Or are there pairs of holds like that? I'm thinking that system boards might have them.),1
1020,Very cool design! It looks great,1
1021,Since I have been hangboarding more than I ever wanted to recently~ a few thoughts on function: - Agree that I would much~ much rather have a wider variety of edge depths than pockets,1
1022,E.g,1
1023,I love boards where you have 8~ 10~ and 12 mm edges so you can progress at or near body weight,1
1024,I find I use pockets very little,1
1025,- Slopers are useful for warming up (if they're easy) but not much for training since they're so conditions-dependent,1
1026,- Holds more than 20mm deep are good for assisted one-arm hangs~ but not so much for 2-arms since you need so much weight,1
1027,Also~ it's annoying to try to do 2-armed hangs when the hold you want is mirrored close to the center of the board so your hands are close together,1
1028,So..,1
1029,maybe put bigger holds for assisted one-arm hangs towards the middle and smaller ones for 2-arm hangs towards the outside? - Make sure you've chosen the best outside radius for the edges,1
1030,Hard to find something that feels good in all grip positions (e.g,1
1031,tiny radii/sharp edges feel good for crimping but hurt a ton open-handed),1
1032,Yes~ this is exactly what I want,1
1033,I hear you that it will make it a bit bulkier~ but don't put form over function here,1
1034,People have strong preferences about the hangboards they like and don't like (I do~ at least),1
1035,Putting an intermediate mounting board might not look as sexy~ but it's super functional and is where I think you're more likely to find a strong market of enthusiastic buyers.,1
1036,Yes~ this is exactly what I want,1
1037,Putting an intermediate mounting board might not look as sexy~ but it's super functional and is where I think you're more likely to find a strong market of enthusiastic buyers,1
1038,The problem is that form and function contribute to each other,1
1039,If your hangboard and mounting system don't look good~ then you won't leave them out and won't end up training as much,1
1040,Plus a bulkier setup would be more of a hassle for setup/takedown and would be larger to store,1
1041,But I like your points! That will also be much less expensive to manufacture without all of the milled features,1
1042,Thanks for the feedback!,1
1043,If your hangboard and mounting system don't look good~ then you won't leave them out and won't end up training as much,1
1044,Isn't the whole point of having the quick-release locks on it to make it easy to take down? I wouldn't care at all that it didn't look quite as sleek~ as long as I could take it down (which I would do even if it was the sexiest-looking hangboard ever~ because my bedroom door would be unusable with it mounted) and I got to use the hangboard of my choice,1
1045,I don't think it would really even add all that much bulk~ either,1
1046,In fact~ if you were planning to just mount a couple small campus rungs on the intermediate board~ it might even end up being less bulky than with the integrated hangboard.,1
1047,I'm working on a mounting-system-only alternative this week! I'll see if I can add that option to the kickstarter page on Thursday,1
1048,"One question though: What's your ideal size for a blank mounting board? I'm leaning towards 28"" x 8""",1
1049,Thanks for the feedback!!,1
1050,Maybe comb through here or a similar page and pick what models you'd like to support? Popular compact boards like tension grindstones and beastmakers would be no problem on 28x8,1
1051,The only question is whether you'd want to support behemoths like the trango rock prodigies that take up way more space,1
1052,I don't know of many bigger boards besides the trango one that are actually popular~ even though they exist~ so idk if that's a use case worth designing around.,1
1053,Sweet! Super excited to hear that.,1
1054,Hey!! I just updated the kickstarter campaign with blank hangboard mounting options.,1
1055," Awesome Design! If I hadn't already said fuck it and mounted to the beam in my hallway I would have bought one!  For reference I needed a mounting board that is a minimum dimension of 32"" wide by 10"" tall to mount the Trango Rock Prodigy",1
1056,Great idea adding the blank board,1
1057,Awesome! Just backed the project,1
1058,Really hope to see this be successful!,1
1059,What kind of shorts do ya'll like to climbin?  I want something form fitting and stretchy with a decent amount of durability!  Thanks in advance!,1
1060,Khaki/cargo shorts (aka korts),1
1061,Who cares about style when you have pockets for food or whatever?  Er~ not exactly form fitting or form flattering though.,1
1062,I guess i should be more specific,1
1063,I'm looking for something to sport climb in~ so pockets are not necessary,1
1064,I just want something that moves well.,1
1065,Lululemon,1
1066,Best sport shorts i own I found on accident at walmart~ Ben Hogan golf shorts,1
1067,Fit slim and have a good amount of stretch,1
1068,They breath well too and are like $12 a pair.,1
1069,Generally~ I don’t like Kuhl brand anything...but I ended up with a pair of their Freeflex shorts and they’ve become my sport climbing go-to.,1
1070,Prana Mojo,1
1071,Find them on sale and pay like $20,1
1072,Mountain Headwear Chockstone,1
1073,Super stretchy~ like 14% elastane,1
1074,Cut off mildly stretchy docker style pants,1
1075,I work in those and just cut them off just above the knees when they start to look unprofessional,1
1076,I’ve been pretty happy with my Gramicci G-Shorts,1
1077,Not the cheapest~ but they are comfy~ durable~ and I like how they look,1
1078,OR Ferrosi,1
1079," You want ""form-fitting""? Like Lycra?",1
1080,I assume so~ isn’t that what sport climbers wear?,1
1081,Adidas knee high or shorts tights cheap and work great for sport / okay on some trad depending on what your doing that day no offwidth or chimney action for these,1
1082,Super comfortable,1
1083,I like board shorts,1
1084,They move well~ light weight~ no or few pockets~ and lots of styles.,1
1085,Patagonia baggies,1
1086," A pair of ""military-surplus"" shorts that I got close to 20 years ago and have endured 7 years as my main climbing apparel",1
1087,They cover the knees~ have cargo pockets~ don't interfere in any movement~ and have been ridiculously durable compared to everything else,1
1088,They also work well in a wide temperature range for some reason,1
1089,Unfortunately they're almost to the end of their life and I haven't found anything close to replace them.,1
1090,+1 for baggies.,1
1091,+1 baggies,1
1092,Speedos,1
1093,This is what I wear: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Russell-Men-s-Woven-Tech-Short/132884286 (this link says out of stock.,1
1094,but Walmart usually carries a comparable~ even if slightly different~ pair in store) Not only for climbing~ but for everything in life,1
1095,Specifically for climbing and kayaking,1
1096,They are made from a similar fabric as bathing suit~ which means they dry quickly after sweat~ rain~ or river water,1
1097,They have a zipped pocket in the back which is great for storing a car key when swimming,1
1098,They have the tie strap around the waist to keep them from falling down,1
1099,And they're super light-weight and stretchy which means they're cool~ comfortable~ and great for climbing,1
1100,Edit: also~ they cost about 10 USD~ so they're much cheaper than climbing specific shorts.,1
1101,Grammicci makes a pair with a stretchy quick drying material and they are comfy and sexy as hell,1
1102,E9 Planet Rondo Shorts~ Moon Climbing Cypher Shorts~ and La Sportiva Levanto Shorts,1
1103,Basically whatever is on sale at the online stores.,1
1104,I very rarely climb with shorts~ even in full summer~ I only do so at crags next to the sea or a river at low altitude~ I never climbed in a desert so far,1
1105,That's why I only own 2 shorts~ the E9 Rondo Shorts and the La Sportiva Leader Short~ both light~ durable and stretch~ I can highly recommend both,1
1106,The 2019 thread was great~ so let's keep this going for 2020.,1

1190,Crazy deals right now on moosejaw+active junky,1

1192,I was able to swap out all my biners for 5.50 per camp photon,1
1193,I'm stoked! Did you do that recently? Because the lowest I'm able to get it now with that code is $137,1
1194,Did you do that recently? Because the lowest I'm able to get it now with that code is $137 Weird! It seems the regular items cost less than clearance items right now,1
1195,I did use a different code that was available at the time~ I purchased on Jan 18,1
1196,I think if you keep an eye on the website you’ll find the deal you’re looking for,1
1197,My guess is EB does these all the time,1
1198,Adidas/Fiveten has Hiangles for 105$ right now and an extra 25% with code JAN25 for a total of 79$/pair (roughly 47% off normal),1
1199,Activejunky is an extra 1% (booo) back,1
1200,Backcountry has same deal as well (last time I checked they had pretty much all sizes) + 12% active junky today,1
1201,Looks like they're trying to clear these out before the launch of the Z4s,1
1202,I don’t know about the deal~ but pay attention to their shipping expenses which could be as high as $30,1
1203,How you reckon? $14 x 0.3 = $4.20 in rewards~ $14 x .14 = $1.96 in cash back.,1
1204,"so thats like $6 ""off"" making them $9/ea?",1
1205,"so thats like $6 ""off"" making them $9/ea? Rack pack is $45",1
1206,$45 * (1-.30-.14) = $25.20,1
1207,Rack pack is $45,1
1208,$45 * (1-.30-.14) = $25.20 Didn't see/still don't see the rack pack so maybe its OOS,1
1209,I have ordered from T-P several times,1
1210,At least on the east coast~ shipping times can be better than most US companies,2
1211,I once ordered skis from T-P on a Sunday~ and they arrived Wednesday via DHL,1
1212,Yes~ shipping costs can be higher than we're used to~ but when you place an order to the US~ VAT will be deducted from your price,0
1213,That plus the generally better prices on ski/climbing gear can more than make up for the shipping costs if you spend a couple hundred dollars.,1
1214,"so thats like $6 ""off"" making them $9/ea? Each biner is $7.95 retail~ so all in with shipping and etc.",1
1215,for the second order that clocks it in around $5 or so a biner,1

1217,Good luck! They do various pct off deals all the time,1

1224,Nice find!,1
1225,An eBay search will find a seller with a few pairs of Anasazi Lace (pinks) in size 10.5 and 11~ for $59 each,1
1226,I purchased a pair from the same seller last month and they were definitely BNIB,1
1227,This is not a great online deal~ it's a shitty marketing campaign.,1
1228,AAC members...go get you your 20% and stack an 8% active junky on it in the meantime!~,1
1229,I have a pair of there jeans and really like them,1

1243,Mountain Steals has a few codes that are still valid  SAVE25 and SAVE35 they both have their own restrictionsClimbersLink.com pays 4% for Mountain Steals they also pay 8% for anything at Black Diamond and 5% back from La Sportiva,1
1244,I picked up a pair when they were $50 and they've been decent for the gym,1
1245,Definitely a step up from something like tarantulaces~ but it also didn't take long for the rubber to start separating from the rand,2
1246,Semi Totem Cam Deal: Campsaver - add 2 totems to your cart,1
1247,(in stock or out) two days later you get a voucher in your email for $25 off your cart,1

1279,I was having trouble paying with cc also...but paypal worked,1
1280,I think I had to try with a couple different credit cards when I ordered from them,0
1281,I may have had to do an extra security step as well (like a confirmation on my phone).,1
1282,When did you see them at 16$ ? They are now back to 21$,1
1283,Yeah I always think it is crazy to see 10 year old used cams for a 20% discount off of current price,1
1284,plus I never buy new stuff at retail either so..,1
1285,Used climbing gear prices seem pretty steep to me,0
1286,I think it's better to consume~ consume~ consume,1

1292,Like now  Really strange !!!!,1
1293,i wouldnt call this next one a great deal but if you make lots of smaller purchases~ GEAREXPRESS.COM is good (i built up a lot of my rack last yaer $50-100 at a time),1
1294,they have most of their cams at %25 off and free shipping over $50 so it's a good site if you're looking to get one alien revolution ($56 shipped)~ or one dragonfly ($56 shipped),1
1295,looks like the only thing they don't sell are totems,1
1296,they are based in utah~ i get my stuff in LA really fast.https://www.gearexpress.com/climbing/protection/cams.html,1

1298,Might be browser issues with EpicTV? Anyway~ I've been waiting for them to restock a shoe and they keep telling me a couple weeks~ but in the meantime I missed a 10% BananaFingers code,1
1299,Anyone know if they run coupons often or know of a code? I wonder since they're technically sister shops if they would price match~ EpicTV is cheaper but they're in different countries,1
1300,That’s~ scored my daughter an R1 for half off!,1
1301,Not a deal~ directly~ but probably valuable 411,1
1302,I had JUST bought my wife a new Patagonia Down Sweater at about 25% off (about $175) when~ just today~ that big 50% off sale included the same item,1
1303,I called Patagonia and~ just like that~ they refunded me the price difference,2
1304,Their official price adjustment policy is 14 days but I suspect they'd do that if it's been longer~ too,2
1305,Great customer service,2

2323,Hi all~  does anyone have experience with ordering a trigger repair kit from BD?   I have a broken trigger on a BD C3,1
2324,There's a round plastic grommet that holds the base of the wire~ inside the trigger bar - that part has broken,1
2325,Does the C3 repair kit that BD has on their website give you these plastic parts as well?  or just the metal wires themselves?   Link to product:blackdiamondequipment.com/e…,1
2326,Just the wire if I’m not mistaken,1
2327,Sounds like yours may be toast,1
2328,Ask BD~ they probably have parts laying around in a drawer,1
2329,Even if you can get your hands on the plastic part~ you wont be able to get it on the cable as they are threaded on before the cable is crimped/swaged onto the head,1
2330,I suppose you could maybe cut it in half and then glue it back together on the cable~ but not sure how well that would work,1
2331,I had a wire pop out of one of those and managed to pop it back in the little hole at the top and bend it back around the plastic slider,1
2332,Used a pair of pliers and hemostats,1
2333,Sorry if you lost the plastic part and this is unhelpful,1
2334,The trigger wire kits I have from BD contains no plastic parts at all,1
2335,"However~ they are labeled ""Trigger C4  BLKD 26024""~ so it might be different than the one you have in mind",1
2336,More importantly~ I've heard rumors that BD does no longer make these,1
2337,Does anyone have good suggestions for DIY material for trigger wires for C4 (the standard BD cam just before the ultra-light version)? I've a decent standard steel wire fitting #3 (which probably fits down to maybe 0.4),1
2338,However~ the 0.3 cam uses a much thinner wire into the lobe and I can't find material that is stiff enough,1
2339,"Any suggestions? (right now I'm leaning towards going all ""soft"" with  a nylon fishing line).",1
2340,You cant have soft trigger wires with C3's,1
2341,There are no springs in the heads of the cam,1
2342,They are below the trigger and push the rigid trigger wires to expand the lobes,1
2343,I've seen some folks use guitar/bass strings..,1
2344,a little janky but not terrible.,1
2345,Had this problem twice,1
2346,Had to send them in both times.,1
2347,Sorry for messing up this thread,1
2348,My comments were regarding the C4~ which is obviously a very different design,1
2349,My brain fart told me C3 was just a previous generation of C4~ which is NOT true,1
2350,Hello all~ I'm trying to get into trad climbing but I'm also a starving college student,1
2351,As I understand~ hexes are a lightweight and cost-effective alternative to getting cams,1
2352,Any recommendations on which ones are the best to get? Or should I just say screw it and purchase cams? Thanks!,1
2353,Buy cams,1
2354,Buy cams~ they are more versatile and quieter than the cowbells you reference in the op,2
2355,Love hexes,2
2356,Bomber,2
2357,DMM Torque Nuts are good (extendable so you save draws)~ Wild Country Rockcentrics are my next favorite,2
2358,If you’re getting the DMM get all four sizes,2
2359,For the Wild Country 5-9,1
2360,Don’t let the hex haters persuade you,2
2361,Purchase cams,1
2362,They've never been cheaper and~ unlike hexes~ you can generally resell them for good value if you end up not liking trad,2
2363,If~ after hearing that~ you still decide you want to buy hexes the best ones are DMM Torque Nuts~ IMO,1
2364,But~ seriously~ save up a few hundred dollars and buy a full rack of used prior generation BD C4s for about $250-$300,1
2365,I like the WC hexes much more than the DMM,1
2366,For endways placements~ the WC taper allows more bite into the rock and less leverage outward from the rope,1
2367,The DMM taper is bass-ackwards,1
2368,Cams unless you get a great deal on used hexes,1
2369,Learn about placing nuts in opposition so you don’t zip out all your pro,1
2370,Get “Mountaineering Freedom of the Hills”~ lots to learn and costs less for brand new copy 9th edition than a set of old hexes or a new cam,1
2371,Awesome! Thanks!,1
2372,I too prefer the DMM Torque nuts over any other design,2
2373,Wired hexes are useless,0
2374,Buy cams~ they are better,2
2375,Despite the multitude of hex haters out there~ hexes are lightweight~ versatile~ work in horizontals~ and are great to save for anchors,2
2376,For knobby flaring cracks hexes can be bomber in placements that wont take cams,2
2377,The dmm hexes are great and the largest BD hex is perfect for flaring fist cracks,2
2378,This is only a concern for your first piece of pro on each pitch and is easily mitigated:  place a cam for your first piece or use one of the bolts if its a bolted anchor or use the highest and/or best cam in your anchor,2
2379,I agree,1
2380,Op spoke of using only nuts on a trad climb,1
2381,I will add: “...highest and/or best cam in your anchor” on a multi pitch,1
2382,Even though I rarely use hexes I'd say yes get them,2
2383,Not the small ones (as small as a large nut) though,1
2384,You can climb with a set of nuts and a set of hexes,2
2385,You will probably want to dial back the difficulty and climb on stuff you won't fall on (passive pro is harder to place correctly and one set of nuts and hexes isn't a lot of pro so you may have some run out sections),1
2386,And it's even more important to have a mentor who can critique how and where you place your pro,1
2387,You could mock lead with this rack and start learning how to trad lead without worrying about falling on badly placed pro or runout sections,1
2388,But you could get your feet wet,1
2389,Then you could buy a set of cams and have the hexes as your doubles of those sizes,1
2390,Then you'll buy a second set of cams and the hexes will gather dust 99% of the time~ but you may pull them out for alpine climbing when you want to go light and the technical difficulty won't be near your limit.,1
2391,Scuse me~ what?,1
2392,Say screw it and buy cams and a set of nuts,2
2393,If you find yourself wanting doubles frequently~ get some (slung) hexes,1
2394,They're way more finnicky~ but if you're climbing below your limit they'll work for keeping you safe,1
2395,Once you get a second set of cams you'll likely rarely use them,0
2396,There are placements where only a hex will fit~ but 90% of the time you'd be better off with a cam,0
2397,They are great for anchors though,2
2398,Alternatively~ find someone with the skills and tools to lead and buy them weed and beer,1
2399,You'll be safer and learn a ton from climbing with someone more experienced.,1
2400,It can be an issue anytime the rope makes a big change in direction.,1
2401,Wired hexes for sure.,2
2402,Metolius curve hexes But~ generally~ don’t think of them as a substitute for cams,2
2403,Think of them as huge nuts - for constrictions,1
2404,Yes indeed,1
2405,I have huge nuts,1
2406,;),1
2407,Scuse me~ what? Let me clarify,1
2408,hexes are lighter than cams and harder to place on lead as anything other than large nuts so they are a good lightweight option to have on hand for extra anchor pieces~ and when you are setting up and anchor they are far more versatile than cams and can be placed actively or passively~ can be slung around a boulder or chockstone~ and are great for cracks that are parallel to the face you are climbing that face the sky on top of routes or pitches where rigid stemmed cams are going to get tweaked or a nut might not place due to the pull direction or parallel sides of said crack.,2
2409,Let me clarify,1
2410,hexes are lighter than cams  Not as much as people think~ though~ now that cam weights have been pared down,2
2411,Wired Blue Torque Nut weighs 161grams,1
2412,Same size BD ultralight blue cam is 167 grams,1
2413,Regular c4 in that size is 181 grams,1
2414,I sometimes carry a green and a red torque nut as a 2nd set in the alpine because I enjoy them,2
2415,And it's nice to have something that's easy to leave behind if you want to bail,2
2416,But the weight argument isn't so compelling any more,1
2417,^ Interesting because they look so much lighter,1
2418,A BD #10 hex is 5.78 oz a #3 C4 is 7.1 oz,1
2419,So the hex is about 80% the weight of the cam,1
2420,I would have though it was much lower.,0
2421,Hexes are a great first piece of gear to buy~ since then you will also have the first piece of gear you will sell,0
2422,Buy cams.,1
2423,Exactly,1
2424,"People used to tell me they were ""half the weight"" and I took that at face value",1
2425,Then I bought a scale and got curious,1
2426,Best way to save weight climbing is to replace heavy carabiners with light ones,1
2427,I wonder if hex development has stagnated since they are kind of an afterthought nowadays,0
2428,Cams have made steady weight reductions over the last 20 years,2
2429,Seem like hexes could have too.,1
2430,Not half the weight but you can have a large hex and a small Tricam or nut for the weight of a cam,2
2431,And you can get a set of nuts for the price of a cam.,2
2432,What more could you do with it? That’s like asking “why haven’t they improved the hammer?” It’s a basic design~ I’m sure it’s as light and thin as can structurally be~ no?,1
2433,I like torque nuts a lot,2
2434,Don't listen to the haters,1
2435,Hexes work well and are bomber,2
2436,Some rock also just takes them really well,2
2437,Now if you just climbing splitters I wouldn't bother with them,0
2438,If you insist on buying hexes get the dmm hexes,2
2439,I have the wild country hexes I bought off ebay for a good price when i was first starting off in trad climbing and even though i seldom use them~ I wish i had the dmm version,0
2440,Complete waste of money,0
2441,Theyre not as easy to set or remove as a cam,0
2442,I think wires on hexes really suck,0
2443,Also~ the solid hexes~ the small hexes~ suck,0
2444,Nuts are better in the small-hex range,2
2445,I significantly prefer the BD hexes~ slung w cord,2
2446,I have also used hexes as hammers~ slings~ and rappel devices,2
2447,They are good at belays~ cause you're standing in a spot to fiddle w em w both hands,2
2448,Theyre cheap to bail off of,2
2449,I carry them on long alpine routes~ because a handful of big hexes is light~ is another handful of gear options~ and if you have to build a dozen rap anchors to get outa there~ you have wide options,1
2450,Not all the bail cracks take nuts,1
2451,Protecting a 5.10 pitch w only hexes/nuts/tricams is Really hard,0
2452,You'll want cams to climb hard.,2
2453,What more could you do with it? That’s like asking “why haven’t they improved the hammer?” It’s a basic design~ I’m sure it’s as light and thin as can structurally be~ no? I would bet they could be significantly lightened with an engineered structure (as opposed to a solid uniform thickness wall),1
2454,Some old hexes had circular holes in them (probably drilled),1
2455,A modern hex could use a structure similar to cam lobes,1
2456,Look how much cam lobes have evolved in 20 years,1
2457,But probably not worth it investment wise due to the limits sales numbers of hexes.,0
2458,If you are new to trad climbing you probably shouldn’t be leading on hexes,0
2459,If I had to lead a climb near my limit with a rack full of hexes~ I’d be pretty damn nervous,0
2460,Cams are much easier to place and more versatile which you’ll appreciate as a new leader.,2
2461,#7~ #9 and #11 is all you need,2
2462," Picked up some of the larger WC hexes and found them to be very ""tinkly"" sounding (vs",2
2463,clanky),1
2464,So if the noise factor is important to you~ there's that,1
2465,I still prefer the BD/Chouinard style but slung on cord (vs,2
2466,wired),1
2467,Having said that~ hexes usually get left behind these days,0
2468,Sometimes will rack one biner with BD 4-7 on long pitches,1
2469,The small wired ones look attractive~ but (as someone said upthread) are redundant and rarely fit better than a similarly sized nut.,0
2470,I started climbing with hexes in the 70’s and early 80’s,1
2471,They work fine and are bomber when well placed ( and yes occasionally they are the only piece for some constrictions in a crack - but skip that placement and put a cam above or below it),2
2472,A cam allows many more options for use on a pitch and they are faster to plug in on hard leads,2
2473,They are also more versatile across many rock types,2
2474,As previously stated cams weights are now similar,2
2475,I still have a lot of hexes but only bring them into the mountains where I carry a few when attempting new routes as they are cheaper and I prefer leaving them behind if they are bomber in situations where I need to bail off the wall,2
2476,Just commit to buying a double set of cams to three inches (plus a big one) and some wires plus light carabiners  and you will be able to climb pretty much any trad route anywhere (except Elbstanstien where you need knots) with more safety than if all you have is hexes,1
2477,Hex placements make adventures seem more adventurous,2
2478,I hate to say this but when deciding who’s advice to take on buying cams or hexes it might be a good thing for you to look at the grade that those people who are telling you to buy hexes climb at,0
2479,I know it’s true that all the old greats used hexes back in the day and ‘they climbed so much harder than us’ but you can make your own decision if the people who are giving you advice to buy hexes top lead grade is 5.8 trad,0
2480,If you start looking at people that climb harder and ask them if they climb with hexes you probably won’t get too many people that do that anymore except for nostalgia,0
2481,Make your own decision obviously,1
2482,I’d buy cams.,2
2483,Funny you repeat what so many have said yet I see more n00bs with triple racks of cams flailing way more often than I see experienced climbers with a light rack,1
2484,I wonder why?,1
2485,I don’t think it’s rocket science to understand why beginners are flailing with whatever gear they have,1
2486,Beginners flail,1
2487,That wasn’t my point at all,1
2488,My point was when you start climbing higher level you trade in the hexes for cams because they are more versatile and convenient for when you’re on the sharp end,2
2489,Unless you’d like to show me modern high end climbers (or even 5.10 trad climbers) that prefer to use hexes (not for the old school feel of it) on a regular biases?,1
2490,Oh~ a higher level eh? I better go buy more stuff so I can climb at a higher level!,1
2491,A person can set a cam incorrectly but guess what~ a person can set a hex incorrectly also,0
2492,You’re using an argument that says that hexes are better because a beginner doesn’t know how to set a cam? I didn’t go to college but I think your argument is called a false correlation argument?(Correct me if I’m wrong~ I didn’t have a lot of the book learnin) It’s like saying a bike is safer than a car because teen drivers crash a lot,1
2493,I mean...it’s your opinion man,1
2494,I’m pretty sure the reasons people climb with cams is because they have more range~ more placement opportunities~ they weigh less and they’re quicker to place,1
2495,You might think that beginners don’t know how to use cams but people who DO know how to use cams choose them over hexes for a reason.,1
2496,I'm still climbing on Hexes I bought back in the 70s,2
2497,I change the cordage out every once in a while tho.,1
2498,Something I find really troubling is that some new trad leaders only use cams,1
2499,I actually went out with a guy who had a shiny new set of cams and didn't know what to do with the nuts I handed him when I said the pitch required them due to rock quality and placement options.,0
2500,This is exactly how I got started...it took 20 years before I had what might be loosely called a “set” of cams,1
2501,I rarely use the hexes now but they got me started with some hand sized pro for 1/3 the cost of the same sized cams and they acted as doubles once I finally could afford a few cams,2
2502,I say get a set,2
2503,You will use them and never be sorry to have another tool in the arsenal,2
2504,Also~ get the slung ones~ not wired,2
2505,Since my main crag is all single pitch trad~ I love building a rap anchor to be left at the top all day out of hexes,2
2506,Much smarter in my opinion than leaving $100 worth of cams unattended 95% of the day.,1
2507,I’m new enough and brave enough to ask:  What makes wired hexes less than ideal? Any when or all the time? Truly need the education,1
2508," ""What makes wired hexes less than ideal? Any when or all the time? Truly need the education",1
2509,""" I personally find equivalently sized cams almost always easier to place",2
2510,It's possible I am jsut a clueless gumby who is making choices because it's easier and faster,1
2511,Which seems okay to me,1
2512,The idea that maybe large cams are suprior to hexes~ and possibly nuts are superior to similarly sized hexes seems reflected in the racks of most of the folks I climb with or see climb (or guidebook listings~ or route descriptions or pretty much every place I see folks talk about what they are carrying),2
2513,Personally~ if price was the issue~ I'd just make it a priority to climb with folks who already have a rack,1
2514,Cause if you're learning~ it would be way better to be following someone who has been doing it already~ anyhow,1
2515,The fact we're mostly climbing with other folks~ and that their tastes and equipment may factor heavily in what goes up the climb~ seems glossed over in this thread,1
2516,I can't even get my partner to take my tricams with him on his pitches,1
2517,And I -like- tricams,2
2518,I have some old hexes from the 90s~ but I don't think I'd have any luck getting my partner to use those when we're climbing any more than my old rigid stem friends,1
2519,I can barely get them to agree to take the couple of totems that I have and like instead of their equivalent x4 cams.,1
2520,I should clarify: I have cams~ wired hexes~ tricams~ nuts~ and even one ballnut,1
2521,But~ what makes wired hexes less than ideal~ and in which situations are they less than ideal and in which situations are they better compared to slung hexes?,1
2522,One word: limestone! On low friction rock passive pro is your friend,2
2523,One word: limestone! On low friction rock passive pro is your friend That’s true,2
2524,I placed a micro cam in some basalt once and it did not inspire confidence,0
2525,I was sure it would slide right out before engaging,0
2526,I haven’t climbed any limestone at all but I assume it’s similar? Are there a lot of limestone crack climbs that protect with gear? I’ve only seen a lot of sport routes in pictures and videos,1
2527," Buy a bunch of cord of various diameters and build a ""Czech Rack."" It will save you tons on gear and you will look cooler",1
2528,The stiffer wire doesn’t allow the hex to “cam” as well as a sling does,0
2529," Go on ""weigh my rack"" and compare a similar sized slung hex and a wired hex",1
2530,Just for example~ the wired green torque nut weighs 15 grams more than the slung equivalent,1
2531,Oh~ a higher level eh? I better go buy more stuff so I can climb at a higher level! Wasn’t the whole context of this thread someone who was new to trad asking which hexes to buy since he couldn’t afford cams? If a new climber can’t place a cam correctly they sure as hell won’t place a hex correctly.,1
2532,Wasn’t the whole context of this thread someone who was new to trad asking which hexes to buy since he couldn’t afford cams? If a new climber can’t place a cam correctly they sure as hell won’t place a hex correctly,1
2533,A new climber probably won’t place anything correctly for a while~ but not a good reason to jump straight to cams -the heaviest and most expensive option - and bypass passive pro proficiency.,2
2534,Even when I first started leading trad I pretty much knew how to place everything correctly,1
2535,I wouldn't be trusting my life to gear I didn't know how to place,2
2536,I climbed with a few mentors,1
2537,Practiced at the base of climbs,1
2538,Then I took a course and the instructors gave all my placements a thumbs up before I led anything,1
2539,The drawback of hexes are they are harder to place correctly vs,0
2540,cams in 90% of the placements I see,1
2541,They're only are easier in constrictions (placing them like a nut) and I don't see that in CA all that often,0
2542,They are also not multi directional like cams,0
2543,They are usually more suitable places for cams,2
2544,Cams are easier and quicker to place,2
2545,IMO cams are safer most of the time for beginners,2
2546,Starting at least 10 years ago I don't see any proficient climbers in Yosemite carrying hexes,0
2547,Some advanced climbers don't even carry nuts,1
2548,The last page discussed weight,1
2549,The fraction of hexes to cams is 8/10,1
2550,Not much of a difference,0
2551,As I mentioned earlier I'd still recommend the largest 3 or 4 size hexes for a cash strapped beginner just due to cost,2
2552,They become the secondary pieces after your first set of cams,0
2553,And save a little bit of weight for alpine or easy climbs.,2
2554,That’s true,1
2555,I have not climbed on basalt but I would imagine it is similar! Tricams~ hexes~ ballnuts~ offset nuts and totem cams are definitely useful on Ontario limestone,2
2556,Regular cams work but the cracks are usually flaring and they tend to rip in parallel  placements,0
2557,Regular cams have to be placed in pods and constrictions,1
2558,The best limestone trad climbers I know have excellent nutcraft! Like anything~ the more practise you have fiddling with passive pro the more efficient you become placing it while cruxing out,2
2559,Maybe these days you dont see climbers in the valley or the creek carrying hexes or nuts~ but they are still widely in use,2
2560,Even on harder traditional routes,1
2561,And lets be honest~ it is much more intimate with the rock~ takes more skill and is more fun than simply plugging a cam.,2
2562,And lets be honest~ it is much more intimate with the rock~ takes more skill and is more fun than simply plugging a cam,1
2563,Well said Ty!,2
2564,Thank you for the excellent information!,2
2565,They are more prone to walking and getting pulled.,0
2566,One of the great thing with the Torque brand hex is the long sling,2
2567,There are a few ways in which you can carry them to mute the cowbell sound too~ by pulling some slack from the top of the hex and clipping that as well,2
2568,I have run out of slings and just used the sling from the hex as a runner clipped to a cam,2
2569,When setting TR's I can usually get by with a set of Torque nuts~ a set of stoppers and a long static line,2
2570,Don’t mute them for god’s sake,1
2571,That “hex sound” is much safer in Bear country,2
2572,Use cams and risk getting eaten by a bear,0
2573,Of course cams are most preferred,2
2574,Which cams? By following others and using their rack you will develop your own preferences,1
2575,In the meantime~ grab a set of hexes and nuts for cheap and get a bunch of easy leads in when u can’t be with a mentor.,2
2576,Gotta watch out for them multipitch bears!,1
2577,LOL,1
2578,I've done that too,1
2579,Hex wasn't right size for the placement,0
2580,Out of slings,1
2581,Stuck a Totem in and used the hex to extend,1
2582,Learning to place nuts and hexes first I think makes a better leader in the longrun.,2
2583,I don't know about better~ but more versatile for sure,2
2584,But I can't even remember the last time I carried a hex on a lead,0
2585,It would probably be sometime in the early 2000's,1
2586,Want to protect the damn funnel at Hawks Nest? Wired hexes,1
2587,I have only 3 small ones~ but you can pull them from my cold dead hands.,2
2588,They are more prone to walking and getting pulled,0
2589,How exactly do hexes walk?  They have no moving parts,1
2590,There are pros and cons to wired hexes,1
2591,The pro is the ease of placement due to the wire,2
2592,The con is that you always have to extend the piece! I have tried a few different styles of hex and I prefer the dmm torque nuts,0
2593,But thats just me!,1
2594,Great input,1
2595,Ease of placement above you/out of easy reach,2
2596,Wired hexes can be more difficult/not placeable in funky spots like pull throughs~ pockets~ and other weird spots where the constriction and the direction of pull aren't in line,2
2597,Slung hexes excel at these,2
2598,Also you can use them as extensions when your draws run out,2
2599,Not that I've ever had to do that...,1
2600,How exactly do hexes walk?  They have no moving parts,1
2601,As the ropes jumps and wiggles~ the sling wiggles~ and the hex will pivot around on its contact points with the crack,0
2602,Just like a nut can be wiggled up and out by the rope~ a hex placement can be manipulated,0
2603,The flat side of the hexis so large~ a small rugosity (sp?) or two can keep it for seating well with a tug,1
2604,Thats another reason stiff wires suck compared to slinging with cord~ and the bennefit of a long sling,1
2605,Incase it hasn't been said~ wired hexes are better for mixed climbing than the slung counterparts~ the wire holds up allot better to being pounded on by an ice tool,2
2606,Recommendation is to not buy them,0
2607,I only lost $35 on resale of my hexes YMMV.,1
2608,As the ropes jumps and wiggles~ the sling wiggles~ and the hex will pivot around on its contact points with the crack,1
2609,I've climbed with hexes off and on for almost 30 years and this has never happened,2
2610,Maybe because I have placed so many that I know what a good spot for a hex is and isn't,1
2611,Gotta watch out for them multipitch bears! You're joking~ but mid multipitch bear attacks have actually happened in the past: http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/2015/12/01/from-dawn-to-dusk-from-dusk-to-dawn/,1
2612,You're joking~ but mid multipitch bear attacks have actually happened in the past: http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/2015/12/01/from-dawn-to-dusk-from-dusk-to-dawn/ I heard that bears prefer the taste of gumby flesh!,1
2613,Well~ climbing bears are only one of your worries,1
2614,Tower bears are crossed with wolverines and are fuckin huge and ill tempered!,0
2615,You're joking~ but mid multipitch bear attacks have actually happened in the past: http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/2015/12/01/from-dawn-to-dusk-from-dusk-to-dawn/ i’ve heard of dropper bears attacking climbers down in arapiles,1
2616,scary stuff!,1
2617,I've climbed with hexes off and on for almost 30 years and this has never happened,1
2618,Any piece can potentially be moved in the crack by the rope,0
2619,Most especially in the alpine~ where routes wander and your rope zigzags,1
2620,Thats why slings are a thing~ because this is an actual problem,1
2621,Not all hex placements are bomber~ nor are all nut placements bomber,0
2622,Youre argument is bomber pieces dont move~ so nothing moves?,1
2623,Youre argument is bomber pieces dont move~ so nothing moves?   Your right~ but it would be physically impossible for that to happen,1
2624,Ideally~ the sling could be extended if the route wandered,1
2625,I have BD hexes that I used to supplement my rack until I eventually collected enough cams~ now I hardly use them,0
2626," I am not strongly opinionated as to which hexes to buy~ just wanted to back you up in your ""I am a starving college student""~ I get it~ and I think getting a small set of hexes (maybe 4 or 5) would be a good idea",2
2627,If you can afford $500 in cams from .3 - 3 then do that I guess,2
2628,My initial trad rack was a set of nuts~ 4 cams and a 4-5 hexes~ 8 lightweight draws and 4 runners,1
2629,Kept me safe..,1
2630,enough.,1
2631,I wear a 42 EU street and have EU40 Otakis just becoming comfortable after 5 sessions I have EU40 skwamas also 5 sessions but they felt comfortable after just 2 sessions,2
2632,I could have maybe gone to 39.5 for both,1
2633,I was thinking about Katana laces for a comfort fit but don’t want dead spaces,2
2634,After spending hours of looking through this forum and elsewhere I couldn’t reconcile the varying advice,0
2635,I have a relatively wide Greek foot shape,1
2636,Thinking about 40~ 40.5~ or even 41 for Katana laces as all day for mostly single pitch but thinking of getting into multipitch,1
2637,TIA just looking for specific advice in case anyone else has had a similar experience.,1
2638,I'd go for the 40.5's~ or the 41's if you want to wear a thin sock with your comfort shoe,1
2639,"My experience: I wear a 44 for LS Futuras/Geniuses as a ""performance"" shoe~ and use a size 46 TC Pro as my ""comfort fit"" shoe",1
2640,I almost always wear socks with my comfort fit shoes~ though,1
2641,If not~ I'd probably size them down to 45.5.,1
2642,You want an all day shoe~ buy one,1
2643,Don't try to fit your way into all day comfort by upsizing aggressive models,0
2644,That is my advice.,1
2645,I agree,1
2646,I've tried this a few times and it hasn't worked,0
2647,Bought Katana Laces a size larger for an extra comfy pair~ and they sucked for edging~ smedging and pockets,0
2648,Tried with Masais too~ with same result,1
2649,Like a TC pro or even a Mythos?,1
2650,Or Maestro...,1
2651,Like a TC pro or even a Mythos? Yes,1
2652,The advantage of the TC Pro is its comfort:performance ratio,2
2653,You can size them down and they’ll still be relatively comfortable after breaking in while retaining performance,2
2654,With the pointy toe and downturn you’ll have to size Katanas fairly big to wear them all day which may lead to dead space,0
2655,I’ve heard of people doing it but you have to have the right foot shape.,1
2656,The TC Pros and the Katanas are built on the same last and are both medium volume,1
2657,According to La Sportiva,1
2658,Yeah but the Katana Lace is a very different shoe,1
2659,It’s even a lot more aggressive than the Velcro model with the downturned toe and higher heel tension and with the lining doesn’t stretch as much as a TC,2
2660,I wear size 45 TC Pros on long multipitches while my 45.5 KL are a performance fit that I wouldn’t want to wear for more than 1-2 pitches.,0
2661,Is there a “black totem” equivalent for belay glasses or are they all generally comparable?  Guess I’m looking for a recommendation,1
2662,My mileage - stay away from plastic frames,0
2663,They flex a little~ prisms will pop out,0
2664,Not a big deal - a bit of crazy glue fixes it,1
2665,Plastic will also break in the most inconvenient moment,0
2666,"I like original ""Belay Specs""  - they seem to limit field of view least~ but my wife dislikes them",0
2667,"She prefers ""Y & Y Classics"" - metal frames",2
2668,Both work over regular glasses.,1
2669,I have been pretty keen on the Y&Y clip ups,2
2670,They flip up out of the way when you don't want to look through them and are more compact than other version,2
2671,Only problem is that the attachment clip to clip to your sunglasses or prescription glasses only accommodates a thin junction between top of lens or nose piece and the lens on the sunglasses or prescription glasses,0
2672,This is not a problem for prescription glasses as few have a large junction~ but many sunglasses have thick plastic across the top of the glasses and the attachment clip won't accommodate that and doesn't seem to accommodate being bent (part of clip is plastic and can't be bent~ the metal part of clip seems like it would break if you tried to bent it),0
2673,I inquired with Y&Y if I could bend them or otherwise accomodate my regular sunglasses and they just said they were built for prescription glasses,0
2674,I have a decent pair of sunglesses with thin junction~ so I just climb with those,1
2675,I rarely climb with my prescription glasses on~ but the clip up fits fine on those,2
2676,I have an old style petzl hard helmet with a pretty low rim and I have to tip up my helmet a tad to flip the belay glasses up and out of the way~ not a big deal and unlikely a problem with modern helmets,2
2677,My wife wears them flipped up when climbing and doesn't have issues (but not climbing hard stuff),2
2678,They have a small case that I keep on my harness and pop them into when climbing,1
2679,Nicer size format than the case for most other belay glasses,2
2680,I have their classic glasses too~ but always choose the clip up and my wife loves them,2
2681,I will try to post pictures of size of cases later.,1
2682,Agreed to avoid the plastic-framed ones,0
2683,Just find the cheapest metal-frame ones on Amazon.,1
2684,Some prisms are different from others,1
2685,I tried a couple different ones and couldn't use them,1
2686,Then I tried a pair that a friend got from Alex Megos that were quality from Europe and they never set my vertigo off like the others did,2
2687,I'm currently using the Metolius UpShot Belay Glasses and those aren't giving me vertigo either,2
2688,Only used them for a year so far so maybe the plastic will cause issues~ but so far~ so good.,2
2689,I like the belaggles more that the Y&Y~ but I am more used to them,2
2690,When I wear the Y&Y~ I feel like I have tunnel vision because the prisms are smaller,0
2691,That said~ as I have gotten older and ent back to wearing glasses~ I'll be buying the Y&Y clip ons.,2
2692,Sunglasses and neck pain have always worked for me,2
2693,I've used the Pitch Six ones and like them a lot,2
2694,I have an original pair of begoogles and the limited viewing angle makes them less appealing,0
2695,I got the $20 cheapo plastic ones off Amazon and haven't had an issue with them except that the case zipper broke quickly,2
2696,Then again when people complain of vertigo or motion sickness~ it's like a bear complaining to a shark that it's knees hurt,1
2697,I have no experience to interpret it through,1
2698,My partner has the Metolius ones and they work well too,2
2699,Just to give you idea of size of Y&Y clip ups & case compared with more traditional sized belay glasses (their classic version),1
2700,Those sunglasses have about the widest nose bridge that these clip ups would fit on - by that I mean it has to be quite narrow as the spring clips need to clamp onto the lens area near the nose and if frame is wide at top the attachment clip won't engage,0
2701,That being said~ the small format of these clip ups and the ability to flip them up out of the way while they are still attached is awfully nice (not affiliated with company~ my neck is just happy that I am using them),2
2702,I purchased some Belay Specs about a year ago,1
2703,I am quite happy with them and recommend them,2
2704,Easy to get on and off over a helmet~ fit well over sunglasses~ the steel frame and nose pieces are adjustable so you can make them comfortable for your face~ and the field of view is wide enough I don't get motion sickness,2
2705,The case takes a bit of getting used to~ but I find it easier than using a zippered case,2
2706,I tried the Y&Y classics (metal frame) and they were too small for my big head,0
2707,The temple arms did not extend far enough to reach over my ears comfortably,0
2708,The bend in the temple arms started a few inches too early~ so the end of the temple was resting on my ear instead of behind it,0
2709,I've heard good things about them but they just didn't fit me,0
2710,If they fit you~ they could be a good choice,2
2711,The CU Belay Glasses looked interesting~ but they were twice the price of the Belay Specs,0
2712,I've been curious about trying a pair~ but not twice the price curious.,0
2713,I have a super cheap pair that I use at the gym,2
2714,They are fine and sturdy enough,2
2715,I keep them in their case between climbs,1
2716,I paid around $25 for them,1
2717,Does anyone have recommendations of pads you can slide over the waist strap of backpacks to make them more comfortable? I have a BD speed back and the thin waist straps get pretty uncomfortable on longer approaches,1
2718,I found a single outdoor product one that works perfectly but they wouldn’t sell me an individual pad,1
2719,I'm sure you could find a shoulder strap pad intended for typical travel bags on Amazon that would work,1
2720,I’ve looked around a bit but surprisingly couldn’t find any that are short enough (6-7 inches).,1
2721,I've made a few (photos),1
2722,PM me if you want to discuss.,1
2723,These shoes look cool~ but it's hard to find somewhere to try them on,2
2724,Anyone have some info on the sizing of these? I'm specifically interested in the up lace,1
2725,I wear 42 in street shoes~ 41 in evolv shoes~ and 39.5 in scarpa,1
2726,Just wondering how these compare.,1
2727,No idea on lace-ups,1
2728,I believe there is a big thread on their shoes somewhere,1
2729,I bought Vim's in size 10 and their tight but fit,1
2730,I might go 10.5 in the future depending on how little they stretch,1
2731,I wear size 42 in Drago's and VSR's and 42.5 in the VS and lace up Instincts,1
2732,9.5 in the old Hiangle's.,1
2733,I have the Up Lace in 42 and it took about two days to break them in,1
2734,I am a 42/42.5 in La Sportiva~ 42 in Five Ten~ and probably like a 44 in Evolv (I've never had a pair that fit my street size without a lot of pain),1
2735,The Unparallels fit my foot a lot better than the Pinks and Miuras of the same size.,2
2736,I wore and 8.5 in the Pinks and wear an 8.5 in the UP Lace,1
2737,Size 10.5 street shoe~ narrow foot,1
2738,I love the UP shoes!,1
2739,Anyone use these shoes (saw another thread that doesn't answer my specific questions)? Wondering how they fit compared to other Scarpa shoes,1
2740,I have Vapor Laces (last yellow/black version) and 43.5 is tight~ 44 for more comfy but still tight,1
2741,Vapor Vs (older) in 45 are all day gym shoes~ but too big for anything above moderate (for me) outside,1
2742,The instinct line doesn't fit as well as Vapors~ too much front volume for the correct length,0
2743,Anyone compare the fit of Mago (new version) to these? I will probably order 2 sizes and send 1 or both back,1
2744,I've found little online about comparisons~ except one review said they run small and to size up,0
2745,Wondering if I should order 43.5/44~ or 44/44.5 (or even 44.5/45 if they run that small),1
2746,No local store has them or will order for me..,1
2747,Many thanks HfM,1
2748,I am street shoe 10.5 and I have the Magos in 43.5~ they are snug but comfortable,2
2749,The heel is kinda mushy~ which may have been less of an issue if I went down a half size,0
2750,I have 43.5 Instinct S and 44 Chimeras that fit similarly~ snug but not painfully tight,2
2751,Sorry I don't wear Vapors for comparison,1
2752,I really like the Magos for their precision and comfort~ personally I'm glad I didn't downsize too much even if they don't heel hook as well.,2
2753,Cool~ thanks,1
2754,Might try a 44 and hope for the best,1
2755,Probably end up a typical online shoe shopping fiasco.,1
2756,I sized up to 41 from my 40.5 Instincts and i wish i had gone up to 41.5 They are doable~ but gnarly tight compared to the Instinct fit and the heel is still baggy,0
2757,I imagine the heel will be baggy for most people regardless of sizing~ though i do tend to have a problem with a lot of shoes feeling baggy in the heel.,0
2758,Ok~ maybe 44.5 then,1
2759,I'm getting to old for ultra tight shoes,0
2760,One tip for baggy heels~ put a thin layer of silicone caulking in there where there are voids and spread it around with your finger (with glove),1
2761,Works pretty well,1
2762,Liquid latex might work too.,1
2763,Thanks for the tip! I'll try this on a cheap pair and see how i like it!,1
2764,I've also done similar on some shoes that shrunk up and became way too tight for me~ and I modified them for my wife,1
2765,Not perfect in that case~ but better than expected.,2
2766,Hi all - I am moving into my car in a couple of days after a COVID layoff in order to afford my student loan payments and also to enjoy some good climbing while I retrain to become a web developer,1
2767,I am planning to live on BLM land in central Oregon and hanging out at Smith Rock,1
2768,I have a small problem currently - I am trying to figure out a way to insure my gear (collectively worth ~15k) in the event that it is stolen from my car,1
2769,I am going to leave some things at a friend's house that I either can't secure while living out of my car (bike) or that I can't use in the summer+fall in Central Oregon (ice+alpine gear+portaledge),1
2770,That being said - I need to figure out how to insure the stuff that will occasionally be unattended in my car while I am out climbing,1
2771,Does anybody have tips + tricks as to how to achieve this? Renter's insurance requires an address~ which I won't have,1
2772,I need to secure my climbing gear since if it is stolen this will be a serious catastrophe,1
2773,I tried finding some specialty insurers - but all of the outdoor gear specific links that I was able to find are expired and no longer in play,1
2774,I'll be chatting with some insurance representatives tomorrow but would like some direction if anybody has had success with doing this with their own gear,1
2775,I will not be selling any of the gear~ since I will be using all of it at some point or another.,1
2776,Many insurance plans have an optional to cover a specific item or set,1
2777,Jewelry is a common thing to get this insurance for,1
2778,What I'm not sure about~ and maybe this is the crux of your question is how those plans interact with cars,1
2779,I know my renter's insurance covers my stuff except when it's in my car,2
2780,Comprehensive auto-insurance covers theft from a car~ but I don't know if that includes some limit that would be less than 15k,1
2781,The crux is not having an address for renters insurance! I need to figure out how to get around that (without committing fraud) - and the qoutes I get for comphrehensive car insurance can be out of this world..,1
2782,15k worth of gear takes up too much space in a car~ get a storage unit,1
2783,So far it fits into four bags (one haul bag stuffed full of ropes~ one haul bag stuffed full of hardware~ one bag stuffed full of ice climbing equipment~ and then my portaledge) which isn't so bad since two of those will be left in a friends gear room,1
2784,You can probably buy a “personal articles” policy from the same insurer who provides your car insurance,1
2785,But be honest about the fact that you’re storing this stuff in your car~ which is frequently parked in public,1
2786,The underwriter may decline coverage under those facts~ or may charge an increased rate,1
2787,What address do you use for your registration and insurance? Use that address,1
2788,Also~ you definitely want comprehensive insurance~ living van life means a higher risk of hitting an animal (which is not counted as a collision)~ hail damage~ damage from falling trees~ etc,1
2789,I pay $800 a year for some kickass Geico insurance,1
2790,My renters is another $200 a year but covers $15k with a $500 deductible,1
2791,MAKE SURE your renters insurance is for the replacement value~ not the current value,1
2792,That way you get a check for the cost of the item~ in new condition.,1
2793,When I lived in a car I had renters insurance,1
2794,I'm pretty sure that I took out the policy on my parents house and said I was renting a room from them.,1
2795,x2,1
2796,"you can even make a lease with your parents and pay them $1 to show money has actually changed hands for the ""room"" they are renting you.",1
2797,Travel Insurance? I recent went on a cross-country bike ride and got travelers insurance~ which also covers belongings based on your policy,1
2798,As it's meant for long-term travel you don't need an address to get insured~ but most policies i looked at had like a 6-month limit.,1
2799,If your stuff at your friend's house is of any value~ you can get a policy that covers that as if you have it in storage,1
2800,At least with USAA~ the stuff in your car would be covered by your auto policy.,1
2801,What address do you use for your [vehicle] registration and insurance? Use that address,1
2802,As a former vagabond~ I used my parent's address~ so use your parent's address or other close relative's address.,1
2803,Renters Insurance,1
2804,Find a way to use someones address,1
2805,Even if you viewed this as fraud it would be the equivalent of stealing from the mafia,1
2806,(except they wont break your knees),1
2807," The real issue with using a ""fraudulent"" address is that if the claim is big enough (and to my mind $15k is ! ) the insurance company might investigate~ and if they do get that far and conclude you were living ""on the road"" and not where you say you were~ then they don't pay off and you've spend money for the policy plus losing your stuff",1
2808,"Pretty easy to find out you're not where you say...couple of phone calls to the neighbors and/or requiring the occupants of ""your address""  to submit a signed~ notarized statement (""on penalty of perjury"") that you live there",1
2809,Hasn't happened to me~ but a car insurance company once sent investigators to where a friend lived because they didn't believe it,1
2810,(Rates were significantly lower than a few miles away.),1
2811,I told my renters insurance that I specifically want it to cover my stuff and I live in my van and they told me no problem,1
2812,Basically~ anything I own is covered no matter where it is,1
2813,If I left a computer at your house and you got broken into~ they will cover that.,1
2814,So..,1
2815,I need an all-day trad shoe for granite/crack climbing and kind of a mix of everything,1
2816,The TC Pros have always been on my list of shoes to try and they were on sale through Moosejaw,1
2817,I went to my local shop and they were able to price match them which was awesome BUT the clerk (whos opinion I do trust,1
2818,He is a long-time climber working at The Gear Room in SLC,1
2819,Respectable shop with solid people who actually climb...) anyway the clerk..,1
2820,"he said~ ""you known~ the Butora Altura is a better shoe for $40 cheaper"" (same price as the TC Pro with the price match sale)",2
2821,He went on to say that the Altura doesn't delaminate at the shoe bend like every TC Pro does~ it is hemp lined so it prevents stretch~ and the rubber is superior than the x-sedge of la sportiva,2
2822,Really it came down to fit for me,1
2823,La Sportiva shoes have always fit my heel very well and the toe box felt better,2
2824,And~ the Altura had a significant pressure point on the side of the foot near that boney bit on the outside edge,0
2825,So~ I went with the TC Pro,2
2826,My question is~ does anyone out there use the Altura and have you had any issues with the shoe? There are so many accounts and reviews of the TC Pro so I know what to expect but very few on the Altura,1
2827,Looking to see if I made the right purchase and if I should consider taking the brand new TC Pros back for the Altura..,1
2828,Let me know! Also~ maybe it's worth it to also bring up any other shoes that might compare to the TC Pro/Altura? What about the Five Ten Grandstones? Or maybe skip the hightops and head for a Katana? Again~ I have an affinity for La Sportiva purely on the heel cup and toe box fit for my foot shape but always open to try new things,1
2829,Nobody loves cause my feet are too big,0
2830,I ended up with some alturas because the TC pros aren't big enough for me (I wear a 48/49 depending on the shoe),2
2831,They feel like a pretty nice shoe~ but I've only been climbing with them for a couple of months so I can't give a long-term report,2
2832,The only other compatible option for me at this size are the scarpa maestros,2
2833,IMO go with whatever you think fits best.,2
2834,Might not be helpful~ but I got a pair of Evolv Generals and like them so much I sold my pair of TC Pros and I ain't going back,2
2835,I've got the orange Alturas~ and they take a LONG time to break-in,0
2836,Wish they were a bit more sensitive~ so perhaps resole with thinner rubber when the time comes and they'll be great,0
2837,Otherwise~ they're superb for foot jams and they're comfortable,2
2838,I've also found the LaSpo's to be a better fit,2
2839,I use my Katanas/Katakis for pretty much everything~ but when it comes to crack~ I switch to the Alturas,2
2840,The guys at The Gear Room turned me onto Butora shoes as well,2
2841,I've had the Alturas for 2 seasons and a pair of the Mantras for one year,1
2842,They both need a resole at this point but I feel like I've gotten good use out of them and they perform well,2
2843,The hemp tops definitely don't stretch as much as leather so I'm much more inclined to pay for a resole compared to the all leather shoes I've had in the past where the uppers stretch too much to be worth it,2
2844,I have a short and wide foot so I like that they have different width options~ although I was hard pressed to tell the difference in the store,2
2845,As with all shoes though~ it doesn't matter how high quality are~ if the fit is off~ don't bother.,0
2846,TC Pros are the best shoe out there!   I absolutely love mine and have for the 20 months that I’ve had them and used them on everything from sandstone to dolomiti to granite and from slabs to edging and cracks,2
2847,You made the perfect choice in my opinion!,2
2848,I'm happy with mine so far,2
2849,They are almost ready for their first resole,1
2850,They are stiff and well-built,2
2851,At first I had a bit of regret about buying them because they put a lot of pressure on my Achilles tendon and did not seem to be breaking in at all,0
2852,However~ they did eventually stretch enough to be comfortable for extended wear,2
2853,I can wear them all day now,2
2854,It is possible that they would stretch enough in width for you to be comfortable..,2
2855,but maybe not.,0
2856,I have a BD cabana + fly that I will happily trade for a good cordless drill with batteries and hardware to even out the deal,1
2857,Let me know if you are interested and I can send you detailed photos of the ledge + fly,1
2858,This should probably be in the climber exchange section,1
2859,Noted!,1
2860,The line from Mammut has been that the new 9.5 Alpine Dry and the 9.5 Crag Dry are equivalent (or even upgrades) to the 9.5 Infinity Dry,1
2861,The Alpine Dry and the Crag Dry have exactly the same specs as each other~ but not as the Infinity Dry,1
2862,Specifically~ the new ropes have more static and dynamic stretch as well as a higher impact force,2
2863,There also don't seem to be any reviews of the new ropes anywhere,0
2864,Has anyone used one of the new ropes? If so~ are they noticeably stretchier than the Infinity? In this video~ the Mammut rep mentions that the new ropes have a higher thread count which supposedly improves handling,2
2865,It would be great to hear from someone who has tried them out...https://youtu.be/JSmOUNdKRJQ,1
2866,I have the 9.0 Crag dry sender and it feels a lot more supple and smooth than the infinity dry I got last year,2
2867,Not much stretch difference but only a few falls to compare on the new rope,2
2868,Could someone explain to me how a rope with more stretch would have a higher impact force? It seems like the opposite would be true,1
2869,Bump~ I'm interested in OP's questions,1
2870,Additionally~ is this why the Infinity Dry seems to not be available anywhere (is it being phased out?),1
2871,The rope is a big spring right~ more stretch=bigger spring but if its a really soft spring it's not going to be able to put up much resistance in heavy loads so will bottom out quicker and more abruptly,1
2872,I imagine the harder catch is probably just tuning the hardness of the catch so it's a softer catch when it's around a ff0.5~ but I'm no rope maker so I could be wrong,1
2873," Do you think people take advantage of being able to wear out a pack~ shoes~ whatever in less than a year to just turn around and get a replacement for free? Have you ever had someone so habitual about it that you had to refuse a return?  On the flip side~ is it totally kosher to wear out some climbing shoes in 4 months and return them for a fresh pair because they ""wore out too fast""? If someone is just getting into a sport~ do you encourage them to try new gear and just return it if they found a better option?",1
2874,This post is a few months or years too late,1
2875,REI has tightened up their return policy~ and no longer owns this site~ either.,0
2876,Use your moral compass,1
2877,If it feels wrong to use gear more than to figure out if it’s right for you then return it~ don’t do it,1
2878,What some stranger (rei employee or random MP user) thinks shouldn’t drive your actions,1
2879,Think of the intent of the policy and ask yourself if you are abusing it,1
2880,No doubt! TBH~ I'm was more curious than anything~ especially with all the online orders people have been doing in the last couple months,1
2881,Personally~ I air on the side of just eating it than returning it,1
2882,Quite a few REI employees and managers would like to see the return policy made stricter than it is now,1
2883,No~ nobody encourages people to try new gear and just return it if they found a better option,1
2884,A certain type of person will always think of that idea themselves,1
2885,I'm inclined to agree with you~ if I picked the wrong product I'll just eat it,1
2886,If I made a decent effort to get the size right and it doesn't fit~ or if the item is defective~ I'll return it promptly~ otherwise I bought it and I'll eat my mistake,1
2887,I don't think I've returned more than 3 or 4 items since I joined REI in 1976,1
2888,Just keep in mind~ with most climbing gear it doesn’t matter how long you tried it out for,1
2889,As soon as the item leaves the store it cannot be restocked so everything you return is going in the trash,1
2890,Take an extra minute to try things on in the store and do your research before buying,1
2891,I've been encouraged by multiple REI employees to do just that in almost every section of the store,1
2892,You don't like this tent~ use it a few times and bring it back,1
2893,Climbing shoes don't break in~ just bring them back and we'll sell them at the garage sale,1
2894,I think it's a pile of crap seeing shoes that have worn through the rand at the garage sale with a note saying~ 'Only used once~' but not everyone has a moral compass that works.,1
2895,Do REI employees judge you for your returns? Yes~ absolutely,1
2896,In fact the record of your transaction history with REI has a KPI that scores your return habits,1
2897,How much did you buy vs how much did you return? They also track your lifetime profitability to them,1
2898,"""How much money have we extracted from X's wallet?"" ""How much more can we extract?"" Don't get confused by the bright shiny light over there",1
2899,Yes returns are tracked,1
2900,Yes your returns are tracked~ summarized and judged,1
2901,"But at the end of the day~ does the return policy (whatever that policy may be) drive profitable sales both short term and far more importantly~ over the long haul? Have you ever decided to purchase a thing you could buy at any number of retailers or ecommerce companies~ at REI solely because of the return policy? If the thought of ""I can return this if it doesn't fit"" or what have you~ moves or has moved you to pulling the trigger on an REI purchase~ then the return policy has driven your behavior and accomplished its one and only goal: drive more sales and drive more profits",1
2902,"If you become unprofitable and return more than you buy they judge you serial returner and your file is flagged and bam~ ""no~ sorry we won't accept returns from you."" = judged",1
2903,I’m an REI employee and yes~ we actually recommend trying gear out all the time,1
2904,Obviously we push that for things we can actually resell~ but if it’s like a harness or any climbing safety thing~ we try to prevent a return by doing a better job recommending products~ because like Lethal Weapon II said~ we can’t resell them~ even at the garage sale,1
2905,It’s definitely irritating when people return things that they’ve used for months before figuring out they don’t like it~ no matter what it is.,1
2906,I'm intrigued,1
2907,I didn't know REI actually denied returns inside of the 12 month limit,1
2908,Has anyone here ever been denied a return that they felt was legit?,1
2909,I've tried to return a bluetooth speaker a couple months after I bought it because the latch which covers all of the cable ports and makes it waterproof broke,1
2910,They denied me the return because I didn't have one of the weird useless mount peices it comes with,1
2911,I felt like that was an excuse to deny me the return~ maybe they thought I broke it on pourpose to get the return,1
2912,I look at it in much the same way as sending back food in a restaurant~ at least have a good reason,1
2913,I knew a serial REI return guy~ skis~ tents~ you name it,1
2914,Some of us were raised differently;),1
2915,That's a poor analogy for me,1
2916,I agree that a good/valid reason should be your basis for a REI return,1
2917,However a restaurant is a different story...have you ever worked in a kitchen or known someone that did? if so~ ask them,1
2918,I would never send for back at a restaurant,1
2919,Well maybe I would~ if i was planning on not eating whatever food came out next,1
2920,I do not have enough trust in humanity that someone didn't F with my food.,1
2921,Having worked at an outdoor retailer with a generous return policy~ the most egregious offender returned his stanky underwear because the elastic wore out after a decade +,1
2922,Yes~ we did judge him,1
2923,Last year or so there was an article about L.L,1
2924,Bean that highlighted the personalities/qualities of their employees regarding returns by abusers,1
2925,Worth the read.,1
2926,I do not have enough trust in humanity that someone didn't F with my food,1
2927,Excellent point! I guess the analogy works for me since I never send food back or return gear,1
2928,The saddest part of that story is learning that REI sells bluetooth speakers.,1
2929,Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral?,1
2930,Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral? Returning any item drives up the store's operating costs and reduces the store's profits~ thereby reducing my profit sharing check that I get every 3 months,1
2931,From a societal standpoint~ buying something with the intention of returning it later is essentially taking something without paying for it (i.e.~ stealing),1
2932,If people want to try something for a while to see if it works for them~ they can rent the item,1
2933,If renting the item isn't an option~ sell it yourself and look at the whatever loss you incur as a rental fee.,1
2934,I haven't liked REI since a rep sold me this: https://www.rei.com/product/157891/rei-co-op-flash-3-season-sleeping-pad Used it only in my car and on carpeting~ but after ~7 months~ the thing couldn't hold air to save its life,1
2935,I kept it around thinking I was crazy since it didn't have any visible tears,1
2936,REI wouldn't take it back because it had been something like a year and a day~ even though it was an REI branded product that sucked,1
2937,Insane to me that they still print their logo on it and sell it~ knowing how bad it is.,1
2938,I worked at REI for a short period of time,1
2939,Most returns were legit and most people genuinely wanted to only return items if they felt it was warranted,1
2940,I only judged people if they were clearly using the return policy as a rental program: returning skis in May/June~ returning mountaineering boots that had no defects~ etc,1
2941,This drives up costs for everyone and was part of the reason REI has dramatically changed their return policy.,1
2942,Been an REI employee at multiple stores~ and knew someone who was a serial returner,1
2943,He would buy shoes~ wear them for a year and then return them~ buy the same shoes etc,1
2944,After only a couple returns management caught on to him and banned him from returning anything anymore,1
2945,So~ he moved onto a different store and they caught on there too,1
2946,It got to the point where they knew his name / face~ and they would greet him when he entered and would follow him around asking if he needed help,1
2947,Eventually he went to stores in different states and they even knew about him there,1
2948,They never asked him to leave but they were passive aggressive enough to make him uncomfortable in the store that he stopped coming around,1
2949,Tldr: REI management tends to be passive aggressive af and they keep track of plenty of weird things,1
2950,Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral? Oh~ don't get me wrong~ it doesn't affect me at all as an employee,1
2951,Irritated is just the way I feel about people taking advantage of the system (and it is a very fleeting feeling)~ and in no way do I think the return policy should change just because there are a few people who take advantage of it,1
2952,I believe that's the price REI pays for having that policy anyway,1
2953,Sure~ you could call it immoral from a societal perspective~ but it's mostly just how I personally feel~ and I don't impart my personal feelings towards the people that make the returns~ or people in general for that matter.,1
2954,I worked at REI for a little over two years,1
2955,At least in my store~ managers would regularly deny returns if it was clear that you were abusing the policy (i.e high return rate~ abusing/using the product outside it's intended purposes~ beyond expected lifespan of product~ etc),1
2956,Ive returned stuff that didn't fit correct but that was known when it showed up on on my first outdoor use of the item,1
2957,I've also blown out gloves over a season of use,1
2958,I bought new gloves because I used the hell out of the first ones,1
2959,People who cynically abuse the REI return policy get reincarnated as a Dung Beetle,1
2960,Lloyd Anderson made the arrangements on one of his Himalayan treks.,1
2961,I judge myself!  I just took a 70M Edelrid TC Pro rope in and returned it after the sheath frayed after 1 sport climbing sesh (with no rock rubbing),1
2962,I am not a person that returns things just because I wear them out/abuse them~ but some situations are warranted,1
2963,It sucked to see that rope get junked as it seemed like such a waste~ but it was defective,1
2964," Over the years I have returned almost nothing that I have purchased~ even when friends have said I should just take it back and ""get a new one""",1
2965,Breaking an item you purchased~ using the shit out of it~ or taking it back because you found something better is not grounds for returning an item IMO,1
2966,Neither is using REI as a rental store for that matter.,1
2967,I've seen a few reviews in the blogosphere since these came out last fall~ but not much from real users,1
2968,Anyone here on MP picked a pair up~ if so what are your thoughts and comments on performance and fit? Saw two complaints on baggy fit in the heel on backcountry~ seems like it has a ton of heel tension on the rand and would be easy to size too large with dead space behind your heel,1
2969,My intent is steeper sport geared more toward edging~ so heel hooks aren't as important~ but I like to trust them when I need to,1
2970,Current go to harder sport shoe is old testarossa and I have a few pairs,1
2971,Use dragos for gym and most bouldering,2
2972,Chimera comes out when I need a hair more edging bouldering,2
2973,Shoes I've owned/have for refernce to compare~ instinct VS~ vapor V~ vapor lace~ skwama~ python~ katana lace.,1
2974,Bueller? Am I not seeing reviews because literally no one bought these shoes yet?,1
2975,Bump for some Mago love?,1
2976,I have 2 pairs and love them,2
2977,Super powerful~ very sensitive but really good support in the front position (big toe platform is v stiff),2
2978,Some people find a little bit of space under the bottom of the heel~ sort in front of the ball,0
2979,Behind the heel not so much a problem,2
2980,Overall~ the heel cup is pretty small relative to forefoot width,0
2981,If you like the instinct family you will likely enjoy magos as well,2
2982,I find them comparable to a chimera (big fav for bouldering) ~ although you also like dragos which i for one cannot get to fit in any size,2
2983,Magos fit similarly to testerossas (original model at least) but are much more comfortable with not nearly the same break-in period in my experience,2
2984,They should be similar as they were designed ~20 years apart by Heinz M~ arguably the most prolific/influential shoe designer in industry history,2
2985,The underfoot/wrap-around randing is way ahead of the teste design in terms of how comfortable it is for the power/precision it provides~ as it doesnt rely on the achilles-busting slingshot heel rand that many shoes past and present use to produce power in the toebox,2
2986,Imo they're sticky AF~ comfy AF for what they are (super high performance shoe),2
2987,They hook in on steeper than vert very well~ but also climb face and hard slab incredibly well,2
2988,They are just horrible for long moderate crack climbs~ so don't buy them for that,0
2989,:) Hope that helps,2
2990,I work in the rock shoe industry fwiw,1
2991,Side note they are blue-green~ colors which have been shown/proven to reduce stress and promote feelings of safety and wellness,2
2992,Maybe that's the extra step needed for the send.,1
2993,Thanks Alex~ great info in there,2
2994,The blue-green color scheme sure looks more soothing and harmonious than the McDonalds themed Testarossas~ which seems to mentally amplify greasy footholds ;) Sounds like you know your stuff~ so in case you're feeling helpful..,2
2995,I'm looking for something to replace Testarossas for edgy sport climbing,0
2996,Something that can handle a little hard-for-me trad/crack climbing would be ideal but I have tight TCs for that so not essential,1
2997,I have low volume feet with long toes and small heel,1
2998,Katakis seem close to perfect~ but are discontinued and can't find my size,2
2999,Instinct Laces were too high-volume (especially in the middle and heel),0
3000,I prefer to not have to size down too aggressively to deal with lots of volume,1
3001,Does the Mago seem like a good idea to you~ or any other suggestions? Feel free to PM if we don't want to hijack Nick's old Mago thread,1
3002,Cheers,1
3003,Any size and/or fit recommendations for the Mago? I fit the Vapor Lace in a 44 very nicely for semi-comfort,1
3004,A 43.5 fits tight as a performance fit~ and a 44.5 would be all day,1
3005,The previous generation Vapor Vs I wear a 45 as a wear all day gym shoe~ and 44 would be a performance fit,1
3006,The Instinct line doesn't really hug my foot and is a bit baggy for the correct length,1
3007,Nowhere near me has Magos to try on~ but wondering if anyone has a size recommendation or if they find the fit comparable with the Vapors? Found a bit suggesting they run small~ so a 44 might be tight and 44.5 might be the money,1
3008,Looking for a Euro limestone near vert to slightly overhanging shoe (Ceuse~ Siurana~ Frankenjura~ etc)..,1
3009,Many thanks,1
3010,Need to buy a swivel....today! Anyone know of a store that stocks them?,1
3011,Not sure but 3 possibilities: REI~ Metalmark climbing and Fitness~ Alpenglow in Oakhurst.,1
3012,Or the mountain shop in yosemite,1
3013,Just saw these~ and was wondering what people who have used the think of them,1
3014,How do they compare to a full sized ascender?  Is there anything a full sized ascender can do that this thing can't?  Just wondering if this is the future of ascenders.,1
3015,They work good enough~ and are lighter than most handled ascenders,2
3016,I've used them for rope-access work~ but not aid climbing,1
3017,I slightly prefer the Petzl ascender~ but might just be because that's what I'm more familiar with,2
3018,HTH.,1
3019,Another light weight hand ascender,1
3020,This is not an ascender~ it is just to help grab the rope.https://skylotec.com/eu_en/ringo-h-205.html#!information The photos on the site show that it relies on the user's hand to hold it to the rope,1
3021,I have one and use it more as a rope grab to haul a small pack,1
3022,I’ve used it as an ascender simply to go very light (I was using a micro trax as my other “ascender” and only to ascend a limited number of ropes.) I wouldn’t take one on an aid wall simply to lighten the load~ it’s a little bit too finicky for that~ you have to pay a bit too much attention to it.,0
3023,My girlfriend and I recently bought a tag line,1
3024,It's a 60 meter piece of 7mm accessory cord,1
3025,We got it for alpine routes requiring full rope rappels and for emergency bails in thunder storms,1
3026,We would have preferred to buy half ropes but couldn't afford it this summer,1
3027,The tag line was $60,1
3028,Maybe next year we'll get doubles,1
3029,We used the tag line for the first time on Petit Grepon~ which requires 6 raps to get off,1
3030,The raps were heinous,0
3031,Hi all~ I am in the market for a new plaquette style device,1
3032,I currently have a Reverso 4~ but I am contemplating between a Pivot~ ATC Guide~ or Reverso,1
3033,I know they all operate essentially the same,1
3034,"When updateing my device~ I am looking for the device that has the least friction when bringing up a second in ""Guide Mode""",2
3035,I already have a GIGI that I carry on longer routes~ but would like a single device that is easiest on my elbows when climbing shorter multipitch routes,1
3036,What are everyone's thoughts with regards to this?,1
3037,Easiest on the elbows would definitely be a Grigri,2
3038,I carry one in addition to the plaquette on short multi pitch routes (and some long ones too),2
3039,Otherwise~ anything besides the Reverso,0
3040,I've found it to have mucho drag,0
3041,Make sure that you dedicate a nice round stock carabiner as the blocker too...,2
3042,DMM Pivot,1
3043,Both the Pivot and the ATC guide accept ropes to 11mm according to their spec sheets,2
3044,Some people claim the rotation of the Pivot makes it easier to pull in rope in guide mode~ but I haven't tried one so I can't speak to that personally,2
3045,I agree with Mike that the blocking carabiner matters and a grigri is best for single followers,2
3046,I use the grigri more than anything else because of the ease of hauling~ lowering~ and lack of elbow pain,2
3047,I have a preference for the ATC-guide because I like the orientation on my belay loop if using it for ascending (when that rare occurrence happens) and it's cheaper for me than the Pivot,2
3048,What's keeping you from using the GIGI for shorter climbs?  It's not good for lead belaying~ but you can just give it to the leader for every pitch,0
3049,Thanks Adam! As a clarification~ When climbing most multipitch routes our party generally tends to carry one Gigi and one GriGri and switch at each belay,1
3050,Where I currently am~ most the multipitch routes are about 3 pitches in length,1
3051,"On these I like to just carry my ""Guide"" device to keep things less cluttered and simple~ plus it is the most versitile belay device overall",2
3052,I understand the added benefits of lowering with a Pivot~ and the orientation difference with the ATC Guide,2
3053,I've considered this~ and I am basically just looking for the ranking of least friction to most friction when belaying from the top with those 3 devices,1
3054,I hope this helps clarify my original question,1
3055,Thanks!,2
3056,Right on~ Chris,2
3057,In that case~ the Pivot is probably your best bet,2
3058,grigri,1
3059,To be fair~ a Gigi adds very little weight or bulk~ and it is still easier to pull slack through than any tube style plaquette.,2
3060,I cannot speak from direct experience~ but I believe that the Mammut Bionic has the lowest friction in guide mode of any tube style device on the market,2
3061,If maximum versatility is what you are looking for~ I would check out the the Gigajul,2
3062,but I honestly think the Gigi/Grigri is the best setup for short multi-pitch climbs with single ropes,2
3063,Hey Karl~ Thanks for your reply,1
3064,I have tried out the GigaJul thinking it would provide the most versatility,2
3065,While I still believe it could theoretically be the most versatile~ I there just seems to be way to much drag when belaying with this is any form (toprope~ lead~ or from above),0
3066,In my experience~ unless you are using ropes smaller than about 9.2~ it is just a pain,0
3067,But again~ thanks for your input,1
3068,I have not looked at the Mammut Bionic~ that may be work checking out.,2
3069,If you liked the Gigajul~ except for the relatively high friction in guide mode~ you might also want to check out the Mammut Alpine Smart,2
3070,It is a bit bulky for my taste~ but guide mode is much lower friction,2
3071,did you try the gigajul or megajul? i've had both and the gigajul is much better for friction,2
3072,my favorite tuber,2
3073,This chart is a bit dated,0
3074,It comes from an old article on Www.cascadeclimbers.com But~ it is at least a starting point for discussion.,1
3075,+1 for pivot,2
3076,Marty~ That is an interesting chart,2
3077,This is essentially the data I am looking for,2
3078,I wonder if there are any updated or newer more comprehensive versions of this,1
3079,Thanks!,1
3080,Ovo or Gigi,1
3081,Weighs nothing~ easy pull,2
3082,You could literally put it in your pocket.,2
3083,I've used a few of the other devices mentioned--namely the gigajul and pivot--and like them a lot for certain uses~ but my favorite guide-style device for multipitch is still the Bionic Alpine from Mammut,2
3084,No fancy assisted-braking features (other than guide-mode)~ but it feeds and takes in <10mm ropes like a dream,2
3085,It's also a lot more durable than full aluminum tubers like the pivot or reverso due to the use of steel for the rope-bearing surfaces,2
3086,If your main rope is >9.5ish~ the Bionic and ATC guide are going to feed better than the pivot~ reverso~ gigajul~ IMO,2
3087,The latter two are better suited for slimmer singles or halves/twins,2
3088,Does anyone have experience with the Up Mocc from Unparallel Sports? I used to love Moccasyms because they worked great for my wide feet,2
3089,I recently purchased a new pair~ and they were so narrow~ I couldn't get my foot into my normal size,0
3090,How do the Up Moccs size compared to the Moccasym? I typically would buy a 9.5~ which would be a quite tight sport shoe for a couple months~ and then would stretch out to gradually become something I could wear all day,2
3091,Thanks!,1
3092,I got them because the mocs aren't what they use to be,0
3093,I'm 13 street shoe~ mocs 11.5,1
3094,I purchased the up moc in 11.5,1
3095,(Worn this shoe for 10+ years now),2
3096,They are sized the same,1
3097,"However~  the up moc is ""thicker"" and slightly more aggressive",2
3098,So its a tighter fit,0
3099,If I purchased another up moc I'd Still get an 11.5 I guess,0
3100,But they still haven't broken in as much as the syms,0
3101,UpMocc wont stretch as much as the 5.10 mocc,2
3102,The up mocc does not stretch much at all~ I size the same as 5.10 mocc,0
3103,I have a few pairs~ 1 on its 3rd sole and they still fit tight,2
3104,Normal moccs never last me this long~ they fall apart,0
3105,Very helpful,2
3106,Thanks all,1
3107,I picked up the UP Moccs a couple months ago for the same reasons you describe,2
3108,Absolutely love them,2
3109,I got the same size that I used to wear in the older Moccasyms and they fit perfectly~ though--as others have said--they don't stretch nearly as much,2
3110,Stickier than the five tens (IMO)~ and they have the best heel of any slipper I've tried,2
3111,Just a heads-up: the reinforced pull-tab on the top initially caused a weird pressure point for me~ but it softened up after a couple of uses,0
3112,Arc'Teryx's warranty is useless,0
3113,I own a lot of Arc'Teryx products that I've accumulated over many years,2
3114,I also own gear from other makers such as Patagonia and Outdoor Research,2
3115,I've submitted claims to Patagonia with no problem,2
3116,Send it in~ get it back repaired~ simple~ no hassle,2
3117,I recently had an issue with Arc'Teryx shorts,0
3118,While they're about 10 years old~ I only wore them occasionally~ casually and on a few day hikes; nothing harsh,1
3119,They were washed in cold water and hang-dried,1
3120,A couple weeks ago~ I pulled them out of my closet to discover the welded pockets were failing,0
3121,I contacted Arc'Teryx and they demanded a proof-of-purchase before repairing,0
3122,seriously? Who keeps receipts beyond a year or two? Patagonia and OR make no such requirement and such is not stated on Arc'Teryx tags,0
3123,I will NEVER again buy anything Arc'Teryx,0
3124,Their warranty is meaningless.,0
3125,I’ve heard that sometimes it can really depend on the Customer Service Rep you get,0
3126,For a counter-example~ I broke the zipper divider on one of my Arc jackets last year,0
3127,Sent them a picture~ and they sent me a new one right away,2
3128,Point is~ it’s not meaningless...,2
3129,I have noticed a general theme as well,1
3130,Patagonia and OR seem to stand behind their stuff in ways that I find remarkable and loyalty-inspiring,2
3131,Arc’teryx seems to try to weasel out of their version of doing the same 1/2 the time~ and repair well and easily~ if not graciously~ the other 1/2,0
3132,So~ my perspective is that it’s not meaningless warranty~ but that I do not depend on it,0
3133,I still buy their stuff when I like it best~ but unless it’s a clear favorite I skew towards other brands.,0
3134,They recently repaired a zipper for me~ no questions asked,2
3135,I dropped it off at an Arcteryx store which may have worked in my favor,1
3136,Glad they didn’t ask for proof of purchase since I bought it used on MP.,1
3137,I've had Outdoor Research and Mountain Hardwear step up in big ways in the last year or so,2
3138,Both times I returned items saying I was happy to pay for a repair as they were 5ish years old and had seen considerable use,2
3139,In the spirit of not tossing otherwise functional gear I wanted it repaired as professionally as possible and was more than ok with paying for it,2
3140,Both companies replaced expensive items even when I offered to pay a pro deal price at a minimum as I didn't consider it warrantied gear failure,2
3141,Demanding a repair on 10 year old SHORTS?? Come on man - don't be like this,1
3142,Arcteryx makes some quality stuff,2
3143,I’ve never had a problem with their warranty,2
3144,I had some stitching pull on a glove I bought at 50% off,0
3145,They determined it to be a manufacturing defect and gave me a full priced credit~ which I promptly put back into a killer pair of Arc gloves,2
3146,The whole process was seamless for me.,2
3147,Here's their warranty for clothing,1
3148,"Ten years is a pretty good run for a pair of shorts:""Practical Product Lifespan means the usual and customary wearable life of the product",2
3149,The Practical Product Lifespan does not mean for your lifetime or mean a time period that is indefinite,1
3150,The manner in which the product is used directly impacts the usual and customary wearable life of the product~ as materials will deteriorate and fade over time and moving parts will also wear,1
3151,Arc’teryx Products are designed for long life and durability~ if care instructions are followed carefully,2
3152,If your Product appears worn out~ then it may be time to replace your product and we hope that Arc’teryx will be a part of your next buying decision,1
3153,Practical Product Lifespan will be determined in the reasonable discretion of an authorized Arc’teryx Customer Service representative who shall take into account at least the following factors: the type and nature of the Product~ the nature of the use of the Product~ nature of the Product issue involved~ and age of the Product,1
3154,"The Arc’teryx Customer Service representative may require consumer information in order to make the foregoing determination and may not be able to make a determination without such accurate information from the consumer.""Edit: This is a very vague warranty",1
3155,"Almost ""meaningless~"" to quote the OP",1
3156,Still~ 10 years of use seems good enough to me,2
3157,Sounds like the repair or replacement is subjective and totally at their discretion,0
3158,Not necessarily wrong~ but vague.,0
3159,Interesting,1
3160,Have had the same failure but was never asked for proof of purchase to get it fixed,1
3161,I agree~ that’s lame.,0
3162,But that wasn’t the reason they denied service,1
3163,Your point is valid~ but irrelevant.,1
3164,I see what you did there.,1
3165,But that wasn’t the reason they denied service,1
3166,Your point is valid~ but irrelevant,1
3167,Yeah~ not having the receipt was the ostensible reason for turning down the warranty service.,1
3168,That is your complaint....they wont repair or replace 10 year old shorts? Dude~ you must have more going and demanding in your life than that.,1
3169,I see what you did there,1
3170,#accidentalwordplay,1
3171,Any reviews out there~ specifically for those that climb a lot on granite?,1
3172,Here is my short term review having broken in the shoe and done a bit of rock climbing in it: The UP site is sorta wrong,0
3173,It feels like a Hiangle in terms of stiffness~ but the rubber is thinner and more sensitive,2
3174,The heel fits me a bit more snug,0
3175,The shoe is slightly less downturned~ but with less forefoot volume and a moderately pointier toe,1
3176,The closure and entry system is actually super useful,2
3177,A bit less midfoot volume than the Regulus and maybe the Regulus LV,1
3178,The heel also feels way more secure for me,2
3179,Super powerful toe~ but doesn't feel as clunky as many stiffer shoes,2
3180,The rubber overlaps with C4 in terms of shore hardness and feels closer to C4 than the RH rubber of the Regulus,1
3181,Not a shoe for smearing~ but could be a great granite/limestone/edging shoe,2
3182,I wear a size 10 street and am a 9.5 Sirius~ 9.5 Sirius LV~ was a 9.5 Regulus LV~ 9.5 Hiangle~ 40.5/41 Solution,1
3183,They are incredibly snug/tight at first~ but once on feel like a good balance,2
3184,I could maybe go a half size up for longer sport/multipitch,1
3185,These would actually be an awesome crack shoe,2
3186,Very low toe profile and big toe patch,1
3187,The closure system might get in the way when jamming really deep,0
3188,I dunno,1
3189,Super versatile shoe.,2
3190,I tried on a pair of the VCS a half size down and they felt great in the heel~ but I had some weird dead space around the big toe~ felt a little long,0
3191,Currently exchanging for 1 size down,1
3192,It felt about the same stiffness as the TN Pro~ but with a snugger heel and better closure system if you want to tighten up that midfoot area,2
3193,I think the TN Pro will still be my go-to bouldering shoe~ but the NewTro VCS will be for anything where I want more sensitivity and power in the big toe,2
3194,Like small footholds on overhangs,1
3195,It's also easier to get into,2
3196,The toe was also more downturned than the TN Pro~ and seemed like it'd be worse for smearing just from walking in them,0
3197,If I end up liking it more than the TN Pro~ I'll probably get the lace version too,2
3198,It breaks in to be quite a bit more sensitive and can actually smear better than you would expect,2
3199,Dan Turner has a glowing review on his YouTube channel,2
3200,​ ​The TN Pro is weird to me,0
3201,Fairly thick rubber and felt more voluminous than the Regulus in the midfoot.,1
3202,What size did you go with for the NewTro~ half size or full size down from street size?,1
3203,Sorry~ 9.5 in all UP shoes including the Newtro,1
3204,My parents live in Tucson and I actually like The Bloc,2
3205,Rocks N Ropes has the Tension Board now too which is nice,2
3206,What/where is the other gym opening up?,1
3207,No issues with the routes and the renovation at RnR is pretty nice,2
3208,But~ had issues in the past with the owner or management staff,0
3209,I’ve worked with a lot of college students who’ve all had ongoing~ very poor experiences with RnR regarding memberships~ fees~ and some pretty awful customer service,0
3210,The climbing is great~ everything else is terrible.,0
3211,Cool I’ll check it out when I visit my parents next,2
3212,That and actually try to hit some of the local bouldering!,1
3213,Does anyone use these cams? do you think  the expandable sling is nice? when I tested it in the store I felt like it kept getting stuck where the sling is sewed,1
3214,Not trying to carry so many alpine draws if I don't have to.,1
3215,Excellent quality~ lightweight pieces~ although sizes are slightly off from the similarly-colored Camalots (only really matters on Wingate),2
3216,The extendable slings aren't long enough to make a difference~ in my opinion,0
3217,Dragons have longer extendable slings~ but no thumb loop,2
3218,yeah~ i really like the dragons but I also have small hands so I prefer the lump loops,1
3219,if the expanding sling doesn't make a difference then I might keep my metolious double rack,2
3220,I like them~ I have .4-3 in friends and C4s as doubles,2
3221,When you extend the sling~ pull the bar tack (aka sewed part) away from the cam~ not the smooth side of the sling to keep everything neat,1
3222,I find the extendo-slings handy when a piece is under a little bulge or just a tiny bit out-of-line,2
3223,Placing a c4 or mastercam unslung I really notice the difference in drag/walking~ the Friend slings do have their use~ you just still need alpines or shoulder runners depending on the route.,2
3224," Not sure the dragons are actually ""longer"" when measuring from axle to sling end:",0
3225,I like them,2
3226,I feel like this help save your alpine draws for the passive placements on a pitch,2
3227,ain't nobody got time for that cmon now,0
3228,There are definitely more than less scenarios that I take less draws due to having the extendable slings but I’d say that’s predominantly single pitch,1
3229,I’ve come accustomed to always ripping the bar tack side to extend due to faffin with them a bit at times~ too,1
3230,I have a friend who has a set of cams with extendable slings,2
3231,They're super annoying to clean as a follower~ and +4 inches is useless for extension,0
3232,I have Dragons and one of my partners has the Friends,2
3233,"While the total length isn't very different~ the Dragons with extended slings just ""feel"" like they're extended more~ maybe because there's more sling and less cam stem? I have placed a Dragon with no additional extension~ but never done so with a Friend",2
3234,With that being said~ they're super useful for getting the carabiner off of an edge~ like someone mentioned above.,2
3235,I totally agree with this,2
3236,I have a single rack of WC friends from .4-4 and depending on the route you still need aplines,0
3237,The extendable draws on the WC friends is only good for little overhangs or extensions,2
3238,I only really find the extension useful when pairing with a sport draw for when I need just a little bit more length,2
3239,Lets me save my alpine draws for nuts and anchors.,2
3240,I have a set of .4-3 WC friends with extendable slings and a set of C4s in the same sizes,1
3241,They are great cams of the same general design~ but I generally prefer the WCs to the C4s because of the sling,1
3242,Also~ there is no anodized finish on the contact points of the lobes on the WCs so theoretically they MIGHT grip better than a new C4? I have yet to be upset about having an extendable sling~ though I do not always use it,1
3243,There are times where it provides just the right amount of extension and can save you from needing to use an alpine draw if you need to conserve them.,2
3244," Doesn't this belong in ""climbing gear discussion"" not ""climbing gear reviews""? And you just need to get in the habit of pulling the strand with the bar tack when you extend",1
3245,I'd also tell you partners to get in the habit of shortening it BEFORE they remove it and repack it when cleaning,1
3246,These two things seem to be the main complaint~ though I don't understand why as it isn't that hard to be smarter than two loops of dyneema instead of one.,2
3247,I put my color code mark on the heat shink over the stiching to make that spot stand out more,1
3248,So you can see easily what to pull to extend.,1
3249,Dude there isn’t any heat shrink on the bar tack that is the dmm dragons,1
3250,I bought my 1-3 sizes~ I'm very happy with them really don't see why I'd go for anything else~ especially if you see any amount of aid in your future of climbing,2
3251,Just came across it~ check it out - https://www.thegrommet.com/palmpress The pitch:,1
3252,For backpacking or climbing~ I don't see this as an improvement over Aeropress or a simple cone brewing method,0
3253,It seems heavy and limited,0
3254,For home use~ looks like a nice option,2
3255,As someone who has owned way too many coffee devices (French Press / Moka / Aeropress / V60 Drip)~ my current favorite - by far - is the Wacoco Minipresso,2
3256,I found mine for $25 online,1
3257,Don't get the knock-off imitations~ my girlfriend did and stopped bothering to send them in for replacement because the replacements would break almost immediately,0
3258,It almost always comes with us when doing low-key backpacking or car camping,1
3259,Espresso = minimum water usage but big taste,2
3260,It's slightly smaller than an aeropress and just as sturdy,2
3261,Tastes a million times better than Starbucks Via or Alpine Start,2
3262,We did a blind taste test vs,1
3263,a $200 home espresso machine and most people in the group preferred the Wacoco,2
3264,We also included the aeropress / french press / etc..,1
3265,Obvious caveat: if you don't like espresso and prefer coffee~ stick with what works,0
3266,The non-espresso people were split between the French Press and Aeropress.,1
3267,Where’d you find it for $25?,1
3268,Where’d you find it for $25?  bought it new from Poshmark.com,1
3269,If I'm going lightweight I'm just bringing instant coffee,1
3270,No question,1
3271,If I'm not~ I'm bringing my trusty old aeropress.,2
3272,I'm with Chris,1
3273,Instant coffee + 1/2 package of hot chocolate mix = backcountry goodness,2
3274,Sometimes I use  filter system but to be honest usually instant~ it just feels more like camping that way.,1
3275,It really depends if you like quality coffee or if you want your classic burnt go-juice,1
3276,For quality instant coffee~ you're not going to find anything better than swiftcup,2
3277,They have some wonderful single origin coffees roasted by some of my favorite roasters (check out ​This​​​ and ​This from middlestate),2
3278,Aeropress with hand Burr grinder for Basecamp,2
3279,V60/aeropress for home,2
3280,If you want burnt go-juice~ Starbucks via and alpine start are fine,0
3281,Not my thing though.,0
3282,Also~ you can just buy the single-use pour over filter/bags empty from amazon and bring your own coffee.,1
3283,yup first ascent is great!,2
3284,Vietnamese Phin..,1
3285,buy there for about a buck~ Amazon prime about $10,1
3286,These are a few bucks..,1
3287,smile.amazon.com/Vietnamese…;qid=1569271025&sr=8-33&th=1 There is a learning curve~ you need the right grind and patience,0
3288,It takes trial and error and some diligence to figure it out,0
3289,Making Vietnamese style coffee you want a strong shot,2
3290,You want it to drip very slowly,1
3291,I carry one and a grinder whenever I am traveling~ including solo international trips with only a day pack's worth of gear.,1
3292,Just take Excedrin if youre backpacking,1
3293,Way lighter,1
3294,Drink good coffee at home,1
3295,No gimmicky mini espresso will beat a real espresso machine in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing.,2
3296,Alpine start is definitely the best instant coffee on the market,2
3297,Its actually quite good for instant; plus Matt Segal started the company~ which is cool,2
3298,Secondly~ the aeropress is the best coffee making system on the planet~ portable~ light~ simple~ makes good coffee,2
3299,I take one traveling with me on international trips.,2
3300,Completely agree! Although I don’t often drink coffee and don’t really understand its taste~ I like to drink coffee very early in the campsite,2
3301,Gives a special charge of energy and an inexplicable feeling of joy,2
3302,I usually just bring some blow...waaay easier,1
3303,Sounds like you aren’t at all so maybe the Keurig type machine would work just fine.,2
3304,Kettle and Chemex is classy looking and fun~ get a metal filter and you're set,1
3305,Do not get a Keurig~ those things are terrible in the waste they generate and they make awful coffee.,1
3306,Agreed,1
3307,I've found that for me life in the backcountry is best when enjoyed in two distinct modes: Super Lux or Super Light,1
3308,The in-between is a no-mans land,0
3309,Heavy enough to be a pain but not enough luxury to really enjoy just hanging out,1
3310,A decent french press will run you ~$20 and tends to be the gold standard.,2
3311,I use an aeropress~ usually~ home and camping both,2
3312,I like just knocking out the grounds and no washing,2
3313,At home~ this goes into a separate compost container for my blueberry bushes,1
3314,Win~ win~ win! I also have an ancient porcelain Melitta setup~ if I want lots of coffee,2
3315,We've had an automatic drip type~ Mr,1
3316,Coffee sorta thing in the past,1
3317,Those are great to put on a timer~ and have coffee waiting for you in the morning! I'm not a coffee aficionado though~ so there's that,2
3318,I buy coffee already ground~ or grind it at the store~ then keep it in the freezer,1
3319,If it's just you~ and just now and then? Go with simple~ and the least waste~ if you like the results well enough,2
3320,Keurig was the go to at the office~ so no one ever washed anything,2
3321,Including the Keurig machine~ which got pretty ugly after awhile,0
3322,If the results aren't to your liking? Go with what you actually enjoy,1
3323,It's these little things that make up most of our lives~ after all,2
3324,Best~ Helen,1
3325,Oh~ I didn’t even expect such diverse opinions,1
3326,Thanks actually,1
3327,skik2000~ you're right~ I'm not a coffee nerd,1
3328,Perhaps such stupid questions would not clog the thread here,0
3329,:),2
3330,During these months~ I use a cold brew coffee maker,1
3331,Very smooth~ mellow~ and low acidity,2
3332,Since it filters like a French press~ I actually filter the cold brew with Chemex filters before storing in jars.,2
3333,I'm surprised nobody here has mentioned just doing cowboy coffee,2
3334,Learn how to do it right and it's the best possible solution~ AND you don't need to carry anything extra besides the coffee,2
3335,To me~ it's the simplest~ best-tasting system.,2
3336,curious what you do with the wet grounds after you drink it?,1
3337,Cowboy coffee will kill you,0
3338,My only reservation about the minipresso is that it is difficult to get a shot close to hot enough,0
3339,(Takes lots of preheating~ etc.),0
3340,What am I missing~ Sven?,1
3341,with a single prime~ mine measured 137.5 degrees in my mug this morning (I keep an insta-read on hand for tea),1
3342,I agree that it's not as hot as I'd like - I prefer my espresso on the 'scalding' end of hot~ but it's fine as long as I don't let it sit out,0
3343,I wonder if temp preference is a learned thing (I still don't know how Italians immediately shoot their espresso at the bar without wrecking their mouths) or an innate preference,1
3344,This paper seems to suggest ~140 +/- 15 degrees,1
3345,Don't tell my boss that I'm typing this instead of working,1
3346,researchgate.net/publicatio…;,1
3347,Sven~ It produces a surprisingly good shot,2
3348,I guess the few times I’ve tried to use it in the backcountry I was disappointed by the temp if all,0
3349,I’ve found the Starbucks instant coffee sleeves a better option,2
3350,Lighter and as hot as you can make water,2
3351,But not espresso~ of course,0
3352,cowboy coffee or instant for simplicity,2
3353,Otherwise~ I've always used a moka pot with preground coffee or a Flair Manual Espresso with manual grinder for car camping (yes I will I bring a stovetop frother and make a latte).,2
3354,I'll chip in that I've really enjoyed my Handpresso Wild Hybrid,2
3355,Got it for around $50 (the $130 retail is madness)~ and it produces a great cup of espresso with decent crema,2
3356,If you get multiple baskets it's pretty easy to swap out for multiple servings (true 50ml shots),2
3357,Portable with minimal mess or fuckery since it's essentially a bike pump,2
3358,There's a bajillion belay devices available these days,2
3359,Does one exist that can perform a double strand rappel~ belay in guide mode and provides braking assist? Note: this rules out the gri gri (yes~ I know about reepschnur's/biner blocks) and plaquette style devices.,1
3360,Gigajul,1
3361,Why rule out the grigri though?,1
3362,Edelrid Gigajul,1
3363,Mammut Smart Alpine too,1
3364,I dont think  the assisted is worth it as much as it is a pain in the ass,0
3365,Ruling out the gri gri since it's heavy and rules out two strand rappelling,0
3366,How's belaying in guide mode with let's say a 9.6-9.8? More friction than an ATC-guide? Would it work in a simul-ling scenario? I sometimes use a gri-gri as a second when simul-ing,1
3367,So do you recommend the device as a single device to bring up a multipitch?,1
3368,So do you recommend the device as a single device to bring up a multipitch? Sort of,1
3369,If the raps are minimal then yes,1
3370,The problem is defeating the assisted mode when rappelling~ it will wear you down over time,0
3371,I use it in the gym only and a reverso most everywhere outside (or grigri if partner is gonna hang),2
3372,In simul you can use the guide mode off the hip (alpine grigri) I guess but depends on your teams preference,2
3373,GriGriandastandardATCforrappelling Does that count as one?,1
3374,grigri,1
3375,I just started using a Gigajul and it does everything you're looking for,2
3376,Assisted braking when belaying on double ropes is a bonus.,2
3377,How well does a gigajul work with roughly 9.5 mm ropes? I’ve heard there is significantly more friction than a reverso/ATC Guide when in guide mode on similarly sized single ropes,0
3378,Smart Alpine I rap with it in ATC mode - you simply reverse the device~ and no braking/locking to defeat,2
3379,If I need it~ I add an autoblock,1
3380,Belays smoother than an ATC guide in guide mode when using thicker ropes,2
3381,Big difference,1
3382,I'm hoping they'll release a Smart Alpine 2.0 - my partner uses the Smart 2.0 for lead belaying me and it is an upgrade in handling/smoothness and braking over the original Smart.,1
3383,The mammut alpine smart is a great devise that does all that you are asking if you use it right,2
3384,The climb tech alpine click up works for everything you want as well- I find it works really well but is a bit more fiddle to start out with,2
3385,Alpine up or gigajul..,1
3386,The Gigajul is pretty decent,2
3387,I've tried it on an old 9.8 and it's not terrible,2
3388,Wouldn't be my first choice of rope/device combo for a longer day~ but functional,0
3389,Use a round stock biner,1
3390,Rap in normal ATC mode,1
3391,On a 9.0 it works fine~ pretty close to a reverso or maybe even a touch easier.,2
3392,I have used a MegaJul for a couple years now~ and like it well enough,2
3393,You can rap in non-assist mode to speed things up~ otherwise it is hard to lower smoothly,0
3394,Good with 7.9mm to 10.5mm ropes,2
3395,My trad rope is a 9.4mm Sterling~ and it works well.,2
3396,If your interested~ me and my climbing partner both have grigris and when we rap down we just both hook on to opposite ends of the rope to counter weight the other person and shoot down that way,1
3397,You set it up like a double strand and everything and it works great if you and your partner are approximately the same weight (40ish pound different between me and my partner),1
3398,The Edelrid MegaJul checks all the boxes you're looking for~ but I just can't bring myself to recommend it for everyday use,0
3399,I like it for alpine since I can give an assisted lead belay on twin/half ropes and it's super light,2
3400,For sport climbing the smoothness is nowhere near as good as a grigri and it's a pain to let rope out once it's weighted,0
3401,Belaying in guide mode on a thick rope is a pain and way less smooth than a BD ATC guide,0
3402,I haven't used a GigaJul yet~ maybe those issues are resolved with the newer device.,0
3403,Since 2012~ I've exclusively used the Alpine Up,2
3404,With a minor work-around to start free-hanging rappels~ the locking feature is great,2
3405,However~ I only use double 8.5 mil ropes~ and think that it would be too aggressive if you use thicker ones.,0
3406,and if you don't think about the consequences~ sure its just that easy/safe,1
3407,and if you don't think about the consequences~ sure its just that easy/safe As long as you have good knots tied in the bottom of your rope the worst thing that could happen is one person gets down quicker and has to lower the other person,1
3408,Nash~ I like simul-rapping too~ but what you just said is simply not true,1
3409,"There are several more possible failure modes - with failure here meaning ""death of one or both members of the party"".",0
3410,So which has less drag for guide mode~ giga jul~ alpine up or mammut smart?,1
3411,working off of the assumption that gear will not fail and both climbers are comfortable rapping and know what they are doing then it is safe to go down,2
3412,It is not as safe as using a Joker or a figure 8 like I would do in a canyon~ but it is not meant to be because of the situation,0
3413,I agree that people can die~ but that can happen using any device or any technique if the person using it doesn't know what they are doing,1
3414,Cue simulrapping thread in 3~ 2~ 1 ...,1
3415,Cut it out.,1
3416,Can you share a picture of this setup? I tried something similar once~ but thought I set it up wrong because the amount of friction was so low it felt nearly impossible to control my descent,0
3417,I've found the Gigajul performs different based strongly on the size of the locking carabiner you use,0
3418,I'm sure it also varies based on the rope diameter~ but I haven't tested that as much,0
3419,I think a lot of the variation that people report is just because they use a single size of carabiner,0
3420,If you try a few different sizes~ you can dial in whatever performance characteristics you're looking for in a given situation (i.e,2
3421,maybe use a thicker one for lead belaying for smoother feeding and a thinner one for rappelling to get the full locking effect),1
3422,Why is it so hard to get a straightforward answer on the amount of guide mode friction for these?!!! How much worse are they than an ATC/Reverso/Pivot/Gri Gri with the ideal carabiner selected,0
3423,Because it depends on the rope.,1
3424,Thanks! I'm glad you chimed in because up until now~ I didn't realize it was impossible to compare the same rope on two different devices...,0
3425,I haven't tried all of them~ but the MegaJul is more friction than the grigri with a Mammut Infinity or a Sterling Fusion Ion R  both about 9.4mm,0
3426,Not enough to bother me~ and you save so much weight and can rap two ropes,2
3427,I really only use guide mode when on bolted anchors~ else I use a re-direct.,1
3428,I have all three devices,1
3429,With a single strand of 8.7mm mammut serenity the order is mammut smart~ alpine up~ giga jul from easiest to hardest,2
3430,Personally I am surprised~ I expected the alpine up to be the most difficult but the giga jul was much more difficult.,2
3431,I haven't used a giga Jul or alpine up~ by my experience is that the mammut smart has the same amount of friction in guide mode as a bd atc-guide when both are in guide mode,1
3432,The smart is a great device with the exception of the extra work involved in rappelling with it.,2
3433,Difference in weight between a gri gri and an ATC is the same as an extra .3 c4 without the biner,1
3434,"It's heavier~ but calling it ""heavy"" is disingenous since the weight difference is almost negligible",2
3435,Gigajul is the most versatile option~ and lead belaying is just as nice as with a GriGri,2
3436,I've started to use it recently and really like it~ although a GriGri is just as good for most use cases~ rappelling being the exception.,2
3437,Got you,1
3438,It depends on the carabiner you're using for the guide mode,1
3439,Adjusting that will adjust the friction to your liking on either device,2
3440,I recently weighted a bunch of different devices to compare,1
3441,I think it hardly makes a difference,2
3442,Except for the grigri~ each device needs two carabiners to belay from an anchor~ so I added that,2
3443,You could argue that the second biner could be reused for something else though,2
3444,Mammut Alpine series,1
3445,I use a Grigri that I added a piece of cord too so it is always clipped to something,1
3446,For long routes I’ll just go with a good old ATC but I’m always fearful of dropping it,2
3447,Not the end of the world I know but a PITA for sure,1
3448,Just like in skiing~ there is no such thing as a quiver of one! I've been taking up an Edelrid Gigajul and a Kong GiGi on multipitch lately~ and I've been pretty happy with that system,2
3449,I like the Gigajul a tad bit better than the Mega Jul for rapping~ and it also feeds out easier while lead belaying with thicker ropes,2
3450,While I love the smoothness of a Grigri while belaying in guide mode~ the Kong GiGi is so much lighter and takes up so much less space on a harness that I prefer taking that now,2
3451,The Kong GiGi doesn't quite feed as smoothly as a Grigri~ but it's still pretty good (just be sure you know how to use one SAFELY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkkFmLoFcFc),0
3452,The other nice thing about the GiGi is it doubles as another belay device in case for some reason I drop my Gigajul (although you can always use a Munter hitch in that scenario I guess),2
3453,I NEVER use my Gigi or Mega Jul for belaying in guide mode,0
3454,my arms get too worn out pulling the rope through! The one advantage a Grigri has over the Kong GiGi is the ability to quickly and safely lower while belaying in guide mode with just a simple redirect,2
3455,I suppose if I was on a climb with a big roof and thought I might need to lower my second~ I'd take my Grigri,1
3456,But otherwise I find it is just too heavy and cumbersome given its limited functionality,0
3457,Regarding the Climbing Technology Alpine Up~ I really had high hopes for it,0
3458,It excels in rappelling~ and I love it for that purpose,2
3459,But at least with the rope sizes I use (around 9.2-10.2)~ it locks up too easily on lead belay and pulls like a bear in guide mode,0
3460,I think with twin ropes it might work great~ but with a single rope it's far from ideal.,0
3461,You can rap with a gri gri - its not very difficult to acheive with a biner block,2
3462,No need to also bring an ATC,2
3463,I head up with only a gri-gri on every multipitch I do and I also rap with it,2
3464,After years of use~ I haven't had any snags or issues and it's a smoother rappelling experience,2
3465,Not futzing around with an autoblock and you can ascend your rope much quicker if you need to,2
3466,You can also self-belay and TR moves quickly if you want to add that to your rappel experience (and dial in that beta to send the next time you attempt the route),2
3467," ""Gri-gris are better in every single possible measure - from safety to user experience."" edit:  Not quite",2
3468,Weight~ price~ double rope versatility~ and admittedly unlikely scenario of a violent factor 1 fall causing the cam to disengage on the Jesus piece,0
3469,Additionally~ I have had a biner block get stuck before where a regular rope would not have,0
3470,Once that happens to you~ who knows~ you may believe it's a possibility.,1
3471,edit:  Not quite,1
3472,Weight~ price~ double rope versatility~ and admittedly unlikely scenario of a violent factor 1 fall causing the cam to disengage on the Jesus piece,0
3473,Additionally~ I have had a biner block get stuck before where a regular rope would not have,0
3474,Once that happens to you~ who knows~ you may believe it's a possibility,1
3475,I've had a biner block get stuck before - it's a quick fix to reascend the rope and has only happened once after hundreds of pulls,1
3476,You can also test the pull before rapping to see if it will or won't get stuck,1
3477,I’m going to throw in my two cents I suppose since we’ve gotten around to discussing the Gri Gri more in depth,1
3478,All use cases are situation dependent,1
3479,That said~ i’ll swap between using an ATC guide~ MegaJul~ Kong GiGi and a Petzl GriGri,1
3480,Depending on what I’m looking for that day,1
3481,Anyway~ for the fastest rappel descents I’ve ever accomplished~ my partner puts their ATC on rappel~ then I choose a strand underneath their device and rappel it with the Gri Gri,2
3482,No carabiner block or anything else needed,2
3483,The side I rappel down has a knot~ the side I don’t does not,1
3484,I clip my tether to the other rope so that it stays within reach and control,1
3485,When I reach the anchor~ I clip in to a quad with my tether~ give slack~ yell “off rappel~” untie the knot~ thread the rope~ retie the knot and wait for my partner,1
3486,They clip the quad~ we pull the rope~ stack rappels again and commit to the rope~ remove the quad and zip to the next anchor,1
3487,My partner had the option to use a fireman’s belay from me~ or can add a prussik backup while I’m already sliding down the rope,1
3488,No one has to wait for anything and there’s no unnecessary risks added,2
3489,Can you share a picture of this setup? I tried something similar once~ but thought I set it up wrong because the amount of friction was so low it felt nearly impossible to control my descent,0
3490,It was shown in the original Mammut instructions that came with my Smart Alpine~ although Mammut seems to have removed them from their current IFU,1
3491,I think we've noted this on MP before,1
3492,You just turn the device around when you load in the two rap strands = ATC style rap,1
3493,"I don't find it lacks friction unless the rope is quite skinny and a steep rap~ if so you can use it ""normally"" or add a ""third hand""",2
3494,Rapping in the standard mode sucks big time and is annoying,0
3495,Great device otherwise,2
3496,Thank you,1
3497,I did set it up wrong on my one attempt,1
3498,I'll have to try this and see how smooth it is,1
3499,The jerky rappel was the only thing about it that I didn't like,0
3500,My personal approach is to bring two devices (ATC or GiGi + GriGri),1
3501,Is it really worth pages of hand-wringing MP threads to save 68g (the weight of a GiGi) off your rack? Plus then you have a second device in case someone drops theirs,1
3502,If so~ others have well addressed the pros/cons of all the various devices in this thread (mega jul~ giga jul~ alpine~ alpine up~ grigri~ etc.),1
3503,They all involve some sort of compromise,1
3504,If not~ just rack up your tube-style device + GriGri and go climbing.,1
3505,I like the GigaJul,2
3506,Its very versatile as long as you pair it with the right rope,2
3507,If the rope is too big of too fuzzy~ it becomes really hard to use in break assist mode and then you only have a very heavy (but more durable) equivalent of an ATC Guide,0
3508,It definitely does not replace a Grigri for single pitch cragging~ but it's the device I want on a multi-pitch.,0
3509,Any max rope diameter you suggest keeping under? I know fat/fuzzy can add a handful of mm's either direction.,1
3510,Any max rope diameter you suggest keeping under? I know fat/fuzzy can add a handful of mm's either direction,1
3511,Try it on the ground first,1
3512,I've had a 9.8mm rope work well while an another one of the same diameter was a total pain in the ass,0
3513,9.5mm or smaller should be fine,1
3514,Rappeling works in assist mode~ but I agree with many reviewers that you get a smoother ride in manual mode with a prussik,2
3515,Hello outdoor recreation hive mind,1
3516,Looking to crowd source some gear research,1
3517,My wife and I are currently looking for a new tent,1
3518,When we're on climbing trips we prioritize comfort over compactness,1
3519,So we're looking for a tent with an epic vestibule (or option to add one),1
3520,At present we've looked at the Marmot Orbit 4P and the REI Kingdom 4,1
3521,It looks like some Big Agnes have the option to aftermarket a vestibule on for additional money,1
3522,Two doors ideal and must be free standing,2
3523,Has anyone seen or purchased such a tent? I've spent a bit of time looking around but there are so many manufacturers out there I know there must be something I'm missing,1
3524,Thanks in advance,1
3525,I'm also looking for something in the 4 person range,1
3526,My last tent got destroyed during a windstorm at Jack's Canyon~ so I'm also looking for sturdiness/durability,0
3527,I've had trouble singling out higher end car-camping tents - most tents are either nice and backpacking oriented or cheap/(flimsy?) and car camping oriented,1
3528,The two you listed look great in terms of being sturdy/solid higher end~ but I'd love to hear other ideas in the same range.,2
3529,Not sure what you mean by epic vestibule~ but I'd recommend the REI Basecamp 4 over the Kingdom 4 unless you really want the stand-up height,2
3530,The Basecamp will still have plenty of room to spread out for two people~ is much more stable in challenging conditions and is a lot easier to set up~ especially if you're short,2
3531,The Kingdom is an excellent fair weather flop and drop tent if you're gonna be in one place for a while~ but I think the Basecamp 4 is much more versatile if the conditions might get a little sporty and you arent sleeping more than two people on cots and dont mind not being able to stand up fully inside the tent,2
3532,The MSR Habitude is also a really nice tent that's similar to the Basecamp in terms of build and intended use,2
3533,The Nemo Wagontop is another excellent option that is more similar to the Kingdom build (tunnelish shape~ more headroom~ etc.),2
3534,It might help for you to think about what sorts of conditions you intend on using the tent in,1
3535,A dome style tent like the Habitude or Basecamp is much better in prolonged wind and rain~ while the tunnel shape of the Kingdom or Wagontop provide more vertical walls and more consistent standing headroom throughout,2
3536,Are you looking for a mesh heavy tent that excels in more humid environments where you need maximum air movement? Or will you be in the desert where sand blowing into the tent is a concern and more nylon panels down low could be advantageous? Do you prefer having greater privacy without the rain fly on (more nylon panels down low)? Or do you not care about privacy panels or figure that you'll have the rain fly on most of the time anyways?,1
3537,@Gregory~ if you're looking exclusively for car-camping applications~ a dome-style tent like a Habitude or Basecamp (see above post) is what you want,2
3538,Tunnel or cabin style tents are sails in high winds in unprotected tent sites and will implode quickly if not aggressively staked out~ and even then the stakes will only do so much with a cross-section as huge as tunnel and cabin tents have,0
3539,If you're looking for a backpacking 4 person~ that's a whole different beast but the REI HalfDome 4 Plus~ MSR Papa Hubba/Elixr 4 are good places to start,2
3540,In general for wind resistance~ well-designed pole sleeves distribute stresses better than clips (but are more of a pain to assemble) and hubbed poles are weaker than individuals,1
3541,Though modern aluminium hubs made by DAC do a much better job in wind than the old cheap plastic hubs made by others~ provided all of the poles are seated fully in the hub intersections.,2
3542,My wife is claustrophobic so we bought the Kingdom 4 and it is amazing,2
3543,We sit in chairs and have coffee in the “garage” with no problems,2
3544,If I remember correctly we had to buy it separately.,0
3545,I also have the kingdom 4,1
3546,Super roomy and very nice,2
3547,Haven’t spent a night in a storm in it yet~ but I don’t have super high expectations,0
3548,The poles are pretty burly though so I expect it to fair okay in everything except some super serious winds,2
3549,If you're a baller:https://hilleberg.com/eng/tent/black-label-tents/saitaris/,1
3550,Thanks Ben! Not looking for a backpacking tent~ have a lovely REI Dash 2 that's been amazing,2
3551,Yeah I do desert~ windy~ dry~ but also mountain thunderstorms~ but rarely humid,1
3552,I'll look into your suggestions.,1
3553,You beat me to it,1
3554,I've been on a couple of trips where we used Hilleberg tents,1
3555,They seem expensive until you use one,2
3556,I recently got a North Face Wawona 6,1
3557,It’s big for what you need~ but it’s vestibule is definitely epic,2
3558,It’s a really nice tent~ well designed,2
3559,But easily the biggest tent i’ve ever owned.,2
3560,...and about to whip,1
3561,Would you prefer that piece of pro to be a cam or hex?  Rock quality is good~ placement is good~ this is the only piece between you and the deck,1
3562,Hex although I rarely carry them,2
3563,Saved my life once while the 2 cams above pulled,1
3564,If the rock is good and the placement is good then I'm equally amenable to either.,1
3565,There is a reason that in this scenario an experienced climber never carries hexes unless the hex placement is textbook keyed in and extremely unlikely to fall out after you climb past it and he knows the route takes one right there where he needs it,0
3566,Tell me the last time you saw a test piece crack climb sent on hexes? It can and has been done~ but nowadays virtually never,0
3567,Ever see Tommy Caldwell or Honnold carry a hex? In experienced hands a cam is far more reliable in more placements~ was faster to place on the way up~ and has more utility for the weight in other varying size cracks on the route,2
3568,If your cams are ripping its you~ not the cam.,1
3569,The best possible hex placement is much better IMO than the best possible cam placement,2
3570,That said~ good cam placements are good enough that I only very rarely carry hexes.,2
3571," The ""best possible hex placement"" is not available 99.9% of the time and you just filled the best jam with it",0
3572,I would prefer if my piece was Jesus.,1
3573,Per the OP if the placements were good..,1
3574,then a cam only because it would be easier to remove?,2
3575,Is the hex placed like a nut? Then a hex,1
3576,Is the hex placed like a cam? Then a cam.,1
3577,Def Hex because then I could say I took a 50 footer onto a Hex! edit: which I've definitely never done,2
3578,Good question,1
3579,The scenario I envisioned had the hex placed like a nut~ not like a hex in a crack at Indian Creek,1
3580,The cam placement was also ideal,2
3581,I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes,1
3582,So in this scenario both are ideal placements,2
3583,Cam because if it’s a hex I didn’t place it and now I’m wondering who the hell just placed gear for me in the middle of a lead.,1
3584,You mean a Jesus Nut?,1
3585,Blue DMM Torque Nut = 14kn Blue BD C4 = 12kn You've already placed it and are far above it~ so ease of placing it is a non-point,1
3586,Bomber hex in this situation is more bomber than the equivalent cam,2
3587,Moving parts = more chance for failure.,0
3588,But how bomber is TOO BOMBER?!?!?,1
3589,bull,1
3590,I’ve heard that at 12 kn you completely liquefy~ so it’s probably immaterial,1
3591,I’ve heard that at 12 kn you completely liquefy~ so it’s probably immaterial  You will wish you turned to liquid if you generate a 12kn fall,1
3592,I don’t think most people realize just what a crazy amount of force that is on the body.,1
3593,It happen to me~ my biggest whipper was on a big hex placed like a cam in a horizontal,1
3594,I still carry the old wired small bd hexes,2
3595,Not the big hexes,0
3596,Any well set chock is fine by me~ im not shooting to rack up and look like the pros,2
3597,Hex~ nut~ rp~ tricam~ double axle cam its all good man!,2
3598,bull,1
3599,Wrong,1
3600,Cams can walk precisely because they have moving parts,0
3601,Hexes placed as passive chocks don’t.,2
3602,Then why do we extend nut placements?,1
3603," ""You’re 20 feet above your last piece of pro and about to whip..."" I get that this is a fun hypothetical to gauge the intangible ""bomberness"" of hexes~ but I feel the need to mention the Law of the Anecdotal Runout here~ which is basically the same function as the Law of the Anecdotal Whipper",1
3604,Claimed Runout/2 = Actual Runout,1
3605,The math is usually as reliable as that bomber hex you're talking about.,1
3606,Unlike a hex~ a well placed cam can fail if the friction coefficient is low enough.,0
3607,Roll the example back 10' when you're 10' above your last piece and looking for your next placement..,1
3608,rolling into that improbably last 10'~ what would you rather have on you rack?  Hexes or cams? It's all hypothetical~ but at this point you'd assume that you're gonna possibly find another placement and you may be pumped when you find that placement,1
3609,So~ at that point~ would you rather have a hex or a cam? Personally~ I dunno if I prefer my coffee without cream instead of without milk~ but I for-sure prefer to have a cam I can't place before I'd take a hex I can't place.,2
3610,This is a trick question,1
3611,"If both placements are textbook and~ ""bomber"" then who CARES what it is",2
3612,Neither one will blow,2
3613,Then why do we extend nut placements? Because nuts are not hexes and they behave quite differently,2
3614,A hex on a dyneema sling like the wild countries doesn’t walk,2
3615,A wired stopper tends to walk because of the stiff steel cable...,0
3616,Trick question point #2,1
3617,Why is anybody getting runout? If you can't reach your next placement from your current placement just drill a rivet,1
3618,Better yet~ drill a hand crack and place a perfect 2,1
3619,Then why do we extend nut placements? Reduce rope drag same as cams,1
3620,An experienced climber would double up~ an old Tony Yaniro strategy~ to make that twenty foot runout more palatable,1
3621,Why not a Hex and a Cam,1
3622,Then~ go for it.,1
3623,Black totem or pink tricam,1
3624,Reduce rope drag same as cams,2
3625,Incorrect~ but good attempt!,1
3626,Incorrect~ but good attempt! Please teach me great master,1
3627,Please teach me great master  1,1
3628,Kevin has more experience with cams than the average guy will get in 20 average climbing careers.,1
3629,So why do we expend nut placements,1
3630,That was the question,1
3631,You extend both of them to increase their security and reduce rope drag.,1
3632,If both placements are bomber then I guess it comes down to: which piece will be easier to remove after the fall?  I don't think I ever removed a hex but maybe they can get welded like a nut,0
3633,So choose the cam.,2
3634,I see you've never climbed Reids direct.,1
3635,I see you've never climbed Reids direct,1
3636,More times than you can imagine,1
3637,Well~ probably more than 10 at least,1
3638,:),2
3639,You extend both of them to increase their security and reduce rope drag,2
3640,"Winner! Cams don't walk because they have springs (though the springs do lend an assist)~ they walk as the rope moves them~ same concern exists with nuts being lifted (or~ in a loose sense~ walking"")~ thus~ the extension",0
3641,Man~ nothing kills a tangential~ barely there joke like an explanation.,1
3642,I’ve heard that at 12 kn you completely liquefy~ so it’s probably immaterial  At that point you are in-the-material.,1
3643,I would rather be above the cam~ because I'd be less pumped than if I placed a hex and I might not fall.,2
3644,I'm in this boat more and more,1
3645,Any thought of the piece not being completely bomber makes me look for another,0
3646,sometimes the magic/sliding death X comes into play even!,1
3647,Cam,1
3648,If it was a hex it wouldn't be mine and I probably wouldn't have clipped it since it was so far back in the crack that I couldn't reach it.,0
3649,That is what they do in England when there is only one place to put pro on the whole climb,1
3650,If 4 pieces equalized makes it safe~ why not do it?,1
3651,You will never beat a solidly placed static piece like a hex....Never~ never~never!,2
3652,...I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes,1
3653,So in this scenario both are ideal placements,2
3654,The most bomber hex placement I can imagine makes me feel happier than the most bomber cam placement I can imagine,2
3655,That said~ I can't remember the last time I had a hex on my rack~ and I have no intention of climbing with them unless there is some special consideration (e.g,0
3656,icy rock),1
3657,I find it amusing that Reed's pinnacle direct came up,1
3658,I was thinking of that exact same route~ which really says something about the rarity of such routes.,1
3659,With the assumption of a good placement I'm ambivalent,2
3660,Hex~ cam~ nut~ pin~ bolt - all satisfactory,2
3661,Have pitched off onto all of them~ over time,2
3662,I'd add that I haven't felt the urge to tote hexes along on a climb in more than 20 years,0
3663,Even when doing super easy but long approach / remote alpine rock routes~ I tend to go with cams and nuts~ not hexes,1
3664,I personally don't find them as versatile,0
3665,I learned to trad a long time ago,1
3666,Hexes were once part of my A Rack,2
3667,They went to the B rack and then finally~ through the fact of simple disuse~ they went to the bottom of one of my oldest spare gear bins,0
3668,They haven't been disturbed in so long I probably need a shovel to dig them out of there,0
3669,I'm not passionate about gear~ frankly,0
3670,Its like any other tool~ a means to and end,1
3671,We can all revel in a perfect hex or nut or cam placement,2
3672,But at some point~ its just a placement~ and so long as the pro is solid for that placement~ it doesn't really matter what particular piece of gear is,1
3673,I sense crusty trad wisdom in this post,2
3674,It is appreciated.,2
3675,Last time I used hexes I dropped purple Wild Country one and almost took out me belayer,0
3676,But~ due to his catlike reflexes he deflected it with his arm and got a nice cut on it,1
3677,I still keep the hexes hoping maybe I’ll find myself in a situation that would make me wish I had the hexes on me.,2
3678,I trust nothing more than a bomber hex,2
3679,I carry both cams and hexes,2
3680,When a climb gets technical~ steep and physical~ I would never reach for a hex,0
3681,They are usually too fiddly! Hexes shine as anchor pieces and pro at easy stances,2
3682,If I climbed at places with splitter cracks~ like Indian Creek~ I would never carry hexes,0
3683,Granite has long cracks~ like at Yosemite,1
3684,If I climbed mostly on granite; I wouldn't use hexes,0
3685,As it is~ I climb most at Seneca~ which has predominantly irregular cracks,1
3686,When the climbing is steep and technical~ I reach for cams,2
3687,When the cracks are too irregular~ I place a nut or a hex,2
3688,Both cams and hexes have a place on my rack.,2
3689,You can’t beat a bad cam placement with a hex because it’s too far back in the crack.,0
3690,Rather whip on a blue offset.,2
3691,Can I get a bolt?,1
3692,this post would be @justbombergear approved,1
3693,This hex gave me the confidence a cam couldn’t to run it out 20 feet on my 5.2 chimney proj,2
3694,Cant beat a well placed hex on quartz~ the rock known for spitting out cams,2
3695,+1 for hexes when you grab them like a tomahawk and toss 'em in there,2
3696,can't do that with a cam,0
3697,"i guess you could ""rodeo clip"" one of those extendable dmm hexes too.",1
3698," Cant beat a well placed hex on quartz~ the rock known for spitting out cams ""On quartz~ you can't beat a well placed hex~"" might be true",2
3699,But I can sure beat a well placed pretty much anything if it's on quartz.,1
3700,I would want to whip on a camp placed behind a restriction~ so that if it blows~ it will still hold as a passive placement,2
3701,With cams you can just hold the end and launch them into the crack like you're spearfishing,2
3702,What happens next is the seconds problem.,0
3703," Cant beat a well placed hex on quartz~ the rock known for spitting out cams forgot an ""ite"" there...",1
3704,What is that?,1
3705,What is that? Apparently we’re all in time-out,1
3706,You will wish you turned to liquid if you generate a 12kn fall,1
3707,I don’t think most people realize just what a crazy amount of force that is on the body,1
3708,If you fall on a piece of pro and it receives 12kn~ you are only going to experience around 7kn (which is still a lot),1
3709,If you feel 12kn~ then your top piece probably held 20kn (which will destroy pretty much anything other than a good bolt),1
3710,This assumes you clipped a piece of gear to redirect the force.,1
3711,Apparently we’re all in time-out,1
3712,Nick was twerking and accidentally booty bumped the hide posts button.,1
3713,This actually happens if you top out on the nautilus after climbing Mother #1 in Vedauwoo,1
3714,In that situation~ a hex placed like a chock both keeps the rope from getting wedged into the crack~ and prevents rope drag,2
3715,It is much more than 20' run out though,1
3716,it isn't really a runout if you are just walking up a low angled slab though :),1
3717,fair enough.,1
3718,satan would place the 666 pink tricam,0
3719,Satan would place a Link Cam so that it would explode when you fall on it and then its carcass would gum up the placement so the next climber is facing a 40' runout,0
3720,A list of who hasn't been frequently flagged in the past might be more interesting,1
3721,Or a list of the flaggers.,1
3722,I've never had a cam fail (knock on wood)~ but all the I'd-fall-all-day placements I have made have been hexes~ nuts~ and passive tricams,2
3723,So given a choice~ I'll fall on a bomber hex,2
3724,That said~ I rarely take my hexes on multi-pitch now and usually let them stay home for single-pitch unless I know I need them,0
3725,Sometimes I think of selling them~ but every once in a while I find that sweet spot where only a hex will do,2
3726,Unfortunately~ it's usually when the hexes aren't with me.,0
3727,A list of who hasn't been frequently flagged in the past might be more interesting,1
3728,Or a list of the flaggers,1
3729,A sensitivity test when setting up your account: more sensitive fewer posts to read,1
3730,Maybe read only files for those allergic to information.,1
3731,Good question,1
3732,The scenario I envisioned had the hex placed like a nut~ not like a hex in a crack at Indian Creek,1
3733,The cam placement was also ideal,2
3734,I’m try to gauge if there is a preference today of cams over hexes,1
3735,So in this scenario both are ideal placements,2
3736,Whether you’d fall on a perfect placement in solid rock after you’ve already racked and placed it is just one small aspect of why people prefer one type of gear over another; and I don’t think it’s gonna get you the answer you’re looking for,1
3737,Like most here~ I’d be equally happy to fall on a bomber cam or a bomber hex,2
3738,But I’ve never routinely carried hexes and likely never will~ while I (almost) never start up a trad climb without some cams~ so yes I prefer cams and no I’d have no preference which to fall on,2
3739,Fuck how do you get in this list ?,1
3740,I think the 3 best uses for hexes are 1) if you have to bail and leave a piece of gear and 2 ) they worked really well to hammer on your nut tool to get up stuck nuts,2
3741,3) to keep a rope  from getting sucked in to a crack,2
3742,I would whip on either if the placement is good in good rock,2
3743,A hex still receives a kn rating and is basically a stopper/nut,2
3744,Hexes we're once the standard for racks but that was before cams were invented,2
3745,They aren't sketchy when used properly~ cams are just easier to handle and place quickly which is why many climbers never will use hexes anymore.,2
3746,Hex:  a large Black Diamond cowbell although I'd have to walk back to the car (or head home) to get it more than likely as I rarely carry them anymore,0
3747,(route specific) That said~ I have seen both nuts and cams pull on people in falls,0
3748,2 examples below,1
3749,1st) Cam story,1
3750,I once saw a single~ only 1/2 way in shitty placement~ crumbly rock~ original ridged stem friend~ hold about 300 lbs (2 people) who fell @ 200' together on to it,0
3751,(double fatality) Lowering them to the ground was a nerve racking experience for 2 reasons that still make me catch my breath,1
3752,1st) We 3rd classed the descent and were over 200' up off the deck with no gear other than their stuff that had been left on the ledge,1
3753,(no harnesses~ not tied in),1
3754,Next~ for whatever reason~ a crowd chose to gather directly under us~ and there was plentiful large loose rock and boulders in the work area that likely would have killed them below had we knocked a single one off~ and they couldn't understand our directions asking them to GTF out of the way,1
3755,That said~ I believe that a cam would be more likely to fail from what I have seen,1
3756,2nd) Nut story,1
3757,"I once saw (We were on P2 of the next route over I ""heard"" it rather than ""saw"" it - then we gave CPR till a doc showed up and said stop) a guy eat dirt after he pulled 4 wired nuts in a row~ 2 or 3 of which he had already fallen on",0
3758,"At no time did this fella take a 20' ""whipper"" onto a piece although it was @ a 70' fall in totality",0
3759,This was on a route known for solid wired nut placements yet dude ripped out 4 in a row~ 2 (or 3) of which had already held him as he hangdogged his way up (fatality),0
3760,It's possible that I prefer a hex because I've seen more folks fall onto cams than hexes,2
3761,Lots more~ more falls = more placement failures,0
3762,So nut or cam? Ya pays yer money~ ya takes yer chances.,1
3763,Since he mentioned indian Creek i would go with the piece that has the most surface are in contact with the rock.,2
3764,Decking might be the most likely outcome,0
3765,Rope stretch~ slack~ belayer lifted after you fall 40 feet,1
3766,I know this may surprise you~ but there are rock climbs longer than 40’.,1
3767,Jesus dude you’ve witnessed a lot of fatalities.,1
3768,Can you explain this accident for a gumby? How did they both fall a full rope length onto one piece?,1
3769,Can you explain this accident for a gumby? How did they both fall a full rope length onto one piece?  Sure,1
3770,A young couple~ both experienced climbers~ climbed a 2 pitch route,1
3771,I suspect~ based on what I saw~ is that this happened (a single hiker saw the fall and ran and we were the first he ran into~ the hiker was not able to describe the scene correctly~ and there was no way he would know what occurred),1
3772,"What we got out of the witness was similar to: ""THEWY FELL COME NOW THEY FELL HELP COME NOW",1
3773,(repeat) NOWWWWWWW,1
3774,""" 250 lb dude led P2 and got to the ledge",1
3775,Belayed 90lb girl up,1
3776,I belive~ guessing on this~ that she couldn't get a piece out so they set up for her to lower him down to get it out,1
3777,She peeled off her shoes~ got comfy~ put dude on belay,1
3778,In the usual hubbub and flifflaff~ they stuck in a friend in a crack above them which was @ 20 feet over to the bolts but didn't double check everything~ and the end of the rope was tied to the friend but she wasn't tied in to it,1
3779,She had him on belay and was lowering him,1
3780,His weight pulled her over and they both hit a ledge on the way down which killed them both,1
3781,He was @ 20 feet below her~ the rope going through her belay,1
3782,Both were hanging on the cliff off of the friend and they were on the same rope~ which had held their fall when they got to the end of the bitter end of the rope,1
3783,Sure,1
3784,A young couple~ both experienced climbers~ climbed a 2 pitch route,1
3785,I suspect~ based on what I saw~ is that this happened (a single hiker saw the fall and ran and we were the first he ran into~ the hiker was not able to describe the scene correctly~ and there was no way he would know what occurred),1
3786,"What we got out of the witness was similar to: ""THEWY FELL COME NOW THEY FELL HELP COME NOW",1
3787,(repeat) NOWWWWWWW,1
3788,""" 250 lb dude led P2 and got to the ledge",1
3789,Belayed 90lb girl up,1

3797,Thanks for taking the time to explain~ Billcoe,1
3798,Huh,1
3799,So she lowered him off her harness without a redirect and wasn't tied into anything? I figured this was some simul-ing stuff I didn't understand,1
3800,Yeah~ that's exactly it Josh,1
3801,Similar to Woody Starks accident (except for 2 ropes and Al was tied off in the back with much too much rope between him and the anchor,1
3802,Woody was 69~ still getting up 5.10 and had climbed most of his life,1
3803,Al was experienced and methodical~ yet still......,1
3804,http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=808573&tn=0&mr=0 Anyway~ thinking about that friend in the rotten seam that held a crazy long fall and over 300 lbs on a single rope makes me change my vote to cam...........,1
3805,Or perhaps neither.,1
3806,Cam,1
3807,Hexes are dumb,0
3808,HEX or a Nut would be my choice,2
3809,Cool~ cowbells climbing Glacier Point.,2
3810,Anyone have experience with the new butora approach shoes? They look cool but not sure how they climb,2
3811,I haven't found much reliable info on this pack and was wondering if anyone on here has used one,1
3812,Seems like a good option for what I need and they're on sale right now so I'm tempted.,2
3813,I have the Alpha FL 45,1
3814,"Not sure how much carryover there is between the ""all around"" and ""fast & light"" models~ but it's been carried around town~ recklessly tossed in the back of trucks~ and stomped on with crampons above 18k feet",1
3815,Doesn't show much wear and for being so minimal I never seem to feel it on my back too much,2
3816,Would recommend.,2
3817,I like most things about mine,2
3818,Comfy and light,2
3819,Carries ice gear well,2
3820,Nice and bright inside,2
3821,Cons: The bottle pocket on the side is stupid short,0
3822,Not quite enough storage in the lid,0
3823,YMMV It took a lot of effort to capture the lid closure loops in the plastic hooks so I had to file down the bumps inside the hooks but that was an easy fix,0
3824,Seems to be holding up ok,2
3825,When I took my 10 yr,1
3826,old Kata 45 in for repairs they gave me the option of having it fixed—which would take weeks—or picking a new pack,2
3827,Good warranty if you ask me.,2
3828,The Alpha ARs are nice but nothing special (which is probably why there is so little information about it available),2
3829,I bought and returned it because the Osprey Mutant 52 is just a little nicer all around IMO~ especially at carrying heavy loads,2
3830,The Alphas AR are fine~ just not outstanding and I hated the finicky buckles,0
3831,The smaller version is discussed in this excellent comparo review:thealpinestart.com/2020/05/…,2
3832,I bought it and returned it,0
3833,To me it did not carry weight very well and I hated the closure snaps - had very hard using them even without gloves - did not feel like trying it on a frozen belay..,0
3834,Has anyone tried these yet?,1
3835,The description doesn't say much,0
3836,What's the difference between these and the regular ones?,1
3837,Black vs red suede,1
3838,The website says that the rubber is slightly different (1.1 vs 1.5)~ which I guess is the coefficient of friction (μ)? Strangely though the weight is listed as exactly the same (57g)~ so I dunno...,1
3839,Looks like they are reintroducing the original design?,1
3840,Just got them in: I can confirm that they are not the same glove just in red,1
3841,The finger holes appear to be larger and the backing material is stretchier,2
3842,Size large is now too big for me~ which is actually good thing,2
3843,I always thought that I was a medium except for the small finger holes on the old gloves,1
3844,Both Size Large,1
3845,"Old vs new ""Lite"" gloves",1
3846,"As I said in my last post~ finger holes on the new ""lite"" gloves appear to be larger and the material is stretchier~ which means I can finally downsize to a medium without cutting off circulation to my two smallest fingers like the old gloves did",2
3847,I'm stoked! Now I just have a pair of larges that I need to sell,2
3848,lol,1
3849,EDIT: Rubber also appears to be stickier,2
3850,Not sure how this will effect performance or durability~ but we'll see...,1
3851,Thanks~ very helpful,1
3852,the ocun v2 ruined the glove~ happy to see that they seem to have undone a lot of the changes in v3,0
3853,The finger hole fabric used to be a synthetic rubber type material,1
3854,Now it is more breathable / flexible,2
3855,"The ""velcro"" is the shiney super grippy kind but they didnt finish then end of the strap well",0
3856,The first 2 gens that was gone well,2
3857,The wrist strap is wider,1
3858,I am hoping this is going to make the hole fot the velcro less likely to tear,2
3859,Like previously mentioned i think i will have to go down a size,0
3860,I failed to mention the because the backing material is thinner and it goes over the hand knuckles the gloves will be overal thinner,2
3861,okay,1
3862,i know all of you are experts,1
3863,Some miscommunication between my gf and I resulted in our dry-treated (core and sheath) rope being left in the bathtub for 2 hours,1
3864,Should I be worried about it's strength being compromised once it's dried out? FUCK.,1
3865,In just water? No,1
3866,Water and Sterling brand rope wash,1
3867,Not at all,1
3868,Certainly cheaper to get a new rope....~,1
3869,I sincerely hope this did not cause any tension between you and your girlfriend,1
3870,Did you raise your voice to her and say a bad word?,1
3871,In my experience~ it sometimes rains for more than 2 hours at a stretch in the mountains,1
3872,Isn't that what a dry rope is for?,1
3873,Consider a day of spring ice climbing,1
3874,The rope is more or less soaked for 8+ hours,1
3875,If a dry treated rope can’t handle that~ it’s not worth the price.,0
3876,No tensions haha,1
3877,Besides~ it was my fault,1
3878,I figured it's fine but I don't ice climb and wasn't sure fully submerging for 2 hours is more water logging than dragging across snow or ice,1
3879,Thanks for the feedback y'all.,1
3880,I wonder why anchor ropes are made of nylon......,1
3881,2/10 ....,1
3882,well 3/10 ...,1
3883,since you made it to 6 hours till you got a troll rating,1
3884,how can you see a troll rating?,1
3885,You just request it.,1
3886,You just request it,1
3887,In my tiredness~ I thought a troll rating referred to a new MP feature under our new~ non-REI overlord,1
3888,In my tiredness~ I thought a troll rating referred to a new MP feature under our new~ non-REI overlord,1
3889,Nope,1
3890,K Weber gave you a rating in the same post that they mentioned it.,1
3891,Nope,1
3892,K Weber gave you a rating in the same post that they mentioned it,1
3893,Indeed~ this history is well documented here on the Proj,1
3894,Praise be unto him.,1
3895,I think this troll post deserves 0/10 since it was a serious question~ albeit a silly one,1
3896,I don't do any ice climbing or lead climbing in torrential downpours~ so my experience with wet ropes is nonexistent,1
3897,Common sense told me it's fine~ but I figured I'd ask the MP oracle~ since the interwebs has wildly differing thoughts on how long to soak a rope when cleaning,1
3898,Let's keep this fine thread going,1
3899,You probably shouldn't wash your rope at all~ especially with soap~ unless there is poop on it or something,0
3900," It won't make it ""clean"" (i.e.~ remove the layer of aluminum oxide that typically makes a rope look filthy)~ but it will diminish the dry treatment and the quality of the handling",1
3901,I learned this the hard way~ with a coupe ropes when I started out climbing,1
3902,Best practice is to keep it clean~ by using a tarp/rope bag whenever possible~  If it's getting dirty~ use a wet rag to wipe it off,1
3903,If it's picked up a lot of grit~ you can submerge it in clean water a couple times to get the grit to drop off,1
3904,But the propensity to pick up grit means your rope is becoming worn out,1
3905,It will still work safely~ but the handling will start to suck and it will wear out your gear much more quickly (due to the grit acting like sandpaper when you lower and rappel),0
3906,Also~ if you got mad at your girlfriend for her somehow being responsible for the washing instructions of your rope~ you aren't going to handle it very well when she misreads the descent description of Forbidden Peak and you end up benighted in 20 below temps,1
3907,This sounds like a personal experience,1
3908,I'll be doing that climb this summer,1
3909,What do I need to know to avoid this epic? PM me!,1
3910,ya I didn't actually think it was a troll post~ that was just poorly veiled sarcasm,1
3911,And though tents are also made of nylon~ they don't hold the lives of you~ your loved ones~ and your friends hundreds of feet in the air~ hence my question,1
3912,I knew ropes can get wet~ just wasn't sure that the submerging them for 4x the time the rope soap instructed was good.,1
3913,Definitely agree with this 100%,1
3914,My rope was loving life and was unbelievably clean until my last multipitch route~ when high winds caused my follower to tuck away our rope tarp until we returned to Earth,1
3915,On the last rap to the ground~ the rope of course pooled in a perfect pile of loose dirt- not the granite slab at the base we were aiming for~ promptly ending my rope's clean appearance...,1
3916,I wonder if the chlorine in the water could do any measurable damage to the nylon? I highly doubt it would do anything--obviously not for just two hours~ but could there be a certain duration that might be unsafe?,1
3917,Hey all~ I've got a couple questions (see bold below) about CAMP Photon wiregates as racking 'biners~ as I ponder an unnecessary switch from BD neutrinos,1
3918,Searching forums has been inconclusive (surprise)~ so since MP is in no shortage of opinions~ I'd love to hear your experience with Photons~ knowing that I'm particularly interested in the downsides (if any),1
3919,THIN NOSE PROFILE: -   Light and allows for more space on your harness..,2
3920,GREAT,2
3921,But I also read in a different thread that the thin/more sharp spot between the basket and the nose could result in rope damage if you somehow manage to fall there,1
3922,Is that fantasy or has anyone had that happen? WEAK SPRING: - The old version was a little weak in the spring,1
3923,Was this resolved with the 2017 redesign? Are Photon springs now snappy..,1
3924,and how long do they stay that way? I've only owned two Photons and one would occasionally get stuck in the open position~ resulting in its early retirement,0
3925,Was that a one-off? Thanks!,1
3926,Yes~ it happens,1
3927,But this is a small percent of the rope severing incidents~ which in turn is small number in its own right.,1
3928,I have a lot of photons,1
3929,When the gates get sticky I just lube them and they keep working fine,1
3930,Not a deal breaker for me,1
3931,I still think they are great for racking and alpine draws,2
3932,I have a few I use on alpine draws,1
3933,I've never had any negative thoughts about them,2
3934,The size and shape make them good for taking a double length sling and making an alpine draw short enough to not get in the way,2
3935,Basically~ I fold it over like usual to make an alpine draw~ then do the same thing again so my double length draw is the same length of a regular alpine draw,1
3936,I can undo one iteration to get extension equal to a regular alpine draw fully extended~ then if I need more extension under the other iteration to get it fully extended,1
3937,Need a big carabiner to make that work with nylon slings,1
3938,I previously used photons and nanos on all my racking biners but stopped,0
3939,The nose on the photon is just not a good design and they easily get hooked around each other if you are thrashing around,0
3940,One simple design change~ making the width of the nose wider than the distance between the wires on the gate would resolve my issue,0
3941,Also the sticky gates do get annoying because you have to lube them frequently.,0
3942,My photons are five years old~ never cleaned or lubed but the gate is still quite snappy,1
3943,I feel like I’m in the minority with that but that’s been my experience.,1
3944,^same,1
3945,The thickness of the Photon at the rope bearing surface is very thin,0
3946,Theoretically~ this would make rope drag worse and~ if taking lots of whips~ wear out your rope faster,0
3947,Not sure if these factors are significant in real life,1
3948,Something like a Petzl Ange has much more surface area in the basket,2
3949,My favorite racking biners to replace Neutrinos are the DMM Phantom.,2
3950,All my photons are great~ no issues~ and work as expected,2
3951,No spring issues~ rope-drag issues any of that,2
3952,Have never lubed any of them,2
3953,I will continue buying them as my racking biner and bolt side biner for my alpine draws until they stop production,2
3954,Now my nuetrinos (think I have one sticking) and my BD Oz (I constantly have 1-3 sticking and requiring lubricant) those are another story.,1
3955,I've used them quite a lot and the gate sticking issue was very common a couple of generations ago but was resolved a few years back,2
3956,They still will start losing their spring tension/snappiness after 400+ days of use~ but that's to be expected of most wiregates,0
3957,I've fallen on them quite a lot at this point and have never had an issue with them,2
3958,I have experienced the hooking issue Parker is talking about~ (mostly in chimneys and flares) but it's never been bad enough that I'd want to change to a heavier/bulkier carabiner,0
3959,The light weight and low profile is well worth it to me.,2
3960,Been using them since they came out,2
3961,I really like them~ especially for alpine stuff,2
3962,Never had any issues,2
3963,Lately however I’ve been switching over to Mammut Crag wire and solid gate biners,2
3964,They are a little more robust feeling and confidence inspiring,2
3965,I’m also starting to use the Camp Dyon and like them but they are pretty pricey.,2
3966,I'd go with nano 22 over photons for racking,2
3967,If you're not going premium like chimera/alpha/helium/dyon~ might as well get some lightness,2
3968,You can find them on sale for not too much more than photons.,2
3969,I use a mixture of Nanos and Photons and like them both a lot,2
3970,All of my alpine draws are photons and have been great for the last three years,2
3971,I have a mix of the pre 2017 (some of which have inconsistent spring tension) and current design ones,2
3972,The current models are fix the spring and tension issues,1
3973,I have also become a big fan of the Dyons.,2
3974,Sorry photons are only rated to like 6000 lbs,0
3975,How much more confidence you need?,1
3976,Sorry photons are only rated to like 6000 lbs,1
3977,How much more confidence you need? I am in full agreement with you~  but the Mammut Crag is just beefier and just gives me a little more confidence~ I’m sure it’s a totally unfounded and I’ve taken lots of falls on Photons and will continue to but the Crag is starting to become my new favorite,2
3978,I am in full agreement with you~  but the Mammut Crag is just beefier and just gives me a little more confidence~ I’m sure it’s a totally unfounded and I’ve taken lots of falls on Photons and will continue to but the Crag is starting to become my new favorite,2
3979,I have a handful of the Mammut Wall Lights~ which are their equivalent of the Nano,1
3980,I REALLY like them,2
3981,I had never seen a Crag until you mentioned them but that looks very similar to the Photon in size and utility,2
3982,I have been on the eternal search for the perfect biner,1
3983,Right now~ my racking biners are all CAMP Dyon's for my Dragon II's and Neutrino's for C4's~ just because they come in the correct colors,2
3984,Dyon's have the thinnest nose profile~ yet retain a good sized rope bearing radius,2
3985,The CAMP Photon~ Orbit and the BD Hotwire are about the same size,1
3986,The Dyon is slightly smaller~ and the DMM Chimera/Phantom are the smallest carabiner I will carry,2
3987,I threw the Spirit in there for comparison,1
3988,I prefer a full size biner for sport draws~ no reason to try and save a few ounces for the pain of a mini biner,2
3989,All of my alpine draws have either a Chimera or a Phantom~ since I also have a rack of gear on me and need to shave ounces wherever I can,1
3990,The action of the CAMP Orbit/Photon is much softer than either the BD~ Dyon or DMM wire gates,2
3991,Some people like snappy gates~ others like softer gates,1
3992,Clock wise from top left:  DMM Chimera; DMM Phantom; Petzl Spirit; CAMP Dyon; BD Hotwire; CAMP Orbit and CAMP Photon,1
3993,+1 on sticky gate issues with the photons,0
3994,Personally I've had this issue with a couple of my newer ones (last two years) rather than the previous generation,0
3995,Lubing the gates seems to do the trick,1
3996,Still my racking carabiner of choice.,2
3997,As important as the axis pictured here~ (if not more so) is the profile as it informs how many carabiners you can fit on a gear loop,1
3998,I haven't used BD carabiners in years now~ but that and weight were the two biggest differences I noticed when I made the switch.,0
3999,I use a gear sling if I am having trouble with too much gear on my harness,1
4000,I actually hate the feeling of a full rack on my waist~ so I tend to use a sling for most multipitch climbing,0
4001,Thanks for all the productive insight everyone~ I really appreciate it! There has been zero thread drift~ no infighting~ AND..,1
4002,no one posted the DMM anchor failures video- I'm amazed! I rarely ever clip the racking 'biner directly (almost always use an alpine draw- either fully extended or folded)~ so snagless racking 'biners aren't really worth the investment for me,1
4003,However~ for all of my alpine draws~ I will be upgrading both 'biners from neutrinos to snagless keylock DMM Chimeras,2
4004,Clipping and unclipping cam slings with neutrinos is really my main carabiner pain point,0
4005,And based on your feedback here~ my plan is to eventually upgrade my racking Neutrinos to Photons and accept the (very minute) risk that in the off-chance I clipped the racking 'biner directly and fell~ it might somehow land on the thin/sharpish spot I originally asked about,1
4006,I might just stick with Neutrinos since I just got an MM Cadillac and now have 2 extra gear loops...,2
4007,I actually find the reverse true...I can't stand a notched biner for racking,0
4008,Nothing worse than being all scrunched up under a roof and having a racking biner get snagged on my gear loops,0
4009,and this is yet another plus for the Dyon..,2
4010,To my recollection~ the Chimera has a VERY wide nose~ which scrunches everything on the harness~ ugh,0
4011,I use Dyon's exclusively for racking biners~ as well as the bolt/gear side of all my alpine draws (I think the weight penalty is worth having the Alpha Sport for the rope end of alpine draws),2
4012,I seem to never see Chimera for less than $10/ea~ whereas the Dyon can typically be found for about $8-$8.50/ea~ which made a substantial difference when I bought  ~100 of them,1
4013,Final point for the Dyon~ there is NO biner that snags less than a dyon~ period.,2
4014,Totally agree with the Dyon nose design being both innovative and effective,2
4015,I think I have 25 or so,1
4016,I do like the Chimera/Phantom size for alpine draws,2
4017,If I'm on a route requiring 10-12 draws~ I am probably wearing a gear sling for my nuts/cams~ with all of my harness gear loops open for draws~ I don't really worry about the width of the biner...but I did measure these with a caliper at the widest part of the nose that would have to go through a wire or bolt~ not the rope bearing surface,1
4018,Dyon:  5.5mm Hotwire:  9mm Chimera:  12mm Photon:  8.5mm Phantom:  6mm Spirit:  7mm,1
4019,just another 'I use to use photons~ but have now mostly switched to dyons and love it' user,2
4020,Only con is the photons are cheaper I guess~ but before I discovered the dyons~ photons were my top choice,0
4021,Edit: I've also treid heiums~ cause a friend raved~ but i'm not a big fan: Not enough colors~ 2 of mine got sticky gates now~ often find the nose doesn't fit through anchor chains~ and they take up noticebly more space on the gear loop..,0
4022,EditEdit: Also~ I've come across some anchors before in which I would fir nothing but a photon,0
4023,Cray,1
4024,EditEditEidt: Ranting about my irrelevant gear preferences is nice~ haven't got to do that with any friends in a number of weeks....,1
4025,I use the Photons on the rope side of my alpines and have loved them so far,2
4026,I've put roughly 200 pitches and plenty of whips on them; no issues,2
4027,I prefer snagless biners for racking and mostly use Hoodwires~ but I also have some Heliums~ Anges and Dyons,2
4028,Heliums are probably my favorite but they don't come in enough colors and are super pricey,0
4029,I extend almost every placement but after making a few desperate direct clips in the Creek~ I wouldn't feel confident in such skinny racking biner,0
4030,Noticing how the biner would have been levered against the crack I was super happy to have a thicker Hoodwire there,2
4031,The Photons are so long and thin it wouldn't take much to snap them,0
4032,Obviously no biner is intended to be levered but I think the Photons are particularly weak in this regard,0
4033,And that's the last thing I want to have in my mind as I'm pulling some desperate moves over them,0
4034,I actually find the reverse true...I can't stand a notched biner for racking,0
4035,Nothing worse than being all scrunched up under a roof and having a racking biner get snagged on my gear loops,0
4036,Buck- so interesting- I always thought I'd find notched racking 'biners annoying too~ but until very recently~ never once had one snag on me- under a roof~ or otherwise! Lately I've been trying to rack gates-out (for harambe!)~ and experienced my first ever snag on a racking 'biner this way (caught my harness),0
4037,I love how gates-out feels on the ground~ but when I'm pumped and fumbling for gear~ it always ends up more arduous for me,0
4038,Guess I'm just a 'gates-in' kinda guy since I learned that way and I'll just have to except the chiding from my friends...,1
4039,Totally agree with the Dyon nose design being both innovative and effective,2
4040,I think I have 25 or so,1
4041,I do like the Chimera/Phantom size for alpine draws,2
4042,If I'm on a route requiring 10-12 draws~ I am probably wearing a gear sling for my nuts/cams~ with all of my harness gear loops open for draws~ I don't really worry about the width of the biner...but I did measure these with a caliper at the widest part of the nose that would have to go through a wire or bolt~ not the rope bearing surface,1
4043,Dyon:  5.5mm Hotwire:  9mm Chimera:  12mm Photon:  8.5mm Phantom:  6mm Spirit:  7mm This is so helpful when visualizing/comparing! Do you have a WC Helium you could measure too?,1
4044,This is so helpful when visualizing/comparing! Do you have a WC Helium you could measure too?  https://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2017/09/13/comparison-review-lightweight-snag-free-carabiners/,1
4045,Christian- agreed~ Chimera seems wide~ but I always keep alpine draws racked on my back loop by themselves and can comfortably fit at least 6 on each side~ plus one quickdraw each (14 total alpine+sport draws)- usually more than enough,0
4046,Plus I have my belay device and a locker for tethering on the back-right and my anchor sling/cordalette on the back-left~ so that's 9 total biners on each back loop,1
4047,9 'biners isn't horribly cramped~ but that's with Neutrinos..,2
4048,I wonder if switching to Chimeras would make it a problem~ and perhaps I should consider the Heliums? I don't like the way the DMM Trad Alpha's kinked spine feels in your hand and I don't love the Dyons either,0
