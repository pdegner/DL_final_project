0,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Best boots I have ever owned. Going on 4 years and their still going strong. I use these boots on a daily basis as well as rough hiking trails in the Tetons. Break in period is a little rough but once you get over that you will not be disappointed.    These boots are True to their size~ meaning I wear a size 9 in running shoes and the same goes with these which would be a 42 euro. I will definitely be buying another pair of these boots in the future.
1,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Extraordinary boot for their intended purpose~ however~ you must be very careful with the fit. These boots will not flex or move on the foot if fitted properly.    I suspect the problems referenced in the above reviews ie broken shanks or holes are attributable to an incorrectly sized boot (most likely too large)~ allowing flex in the foot to boot interface~ which will workharden the shanks (it's about the only way you can break a full length steel shank). If you're getting blisters with these boots~ you have at least a size too big.     The dual stage lacing system also takes some getting used too~ and requires adjustment after the foot has swollen a bit~ perhaps a mile or so into each day to maintain proper fit.    I would recommend these for any alpine activity or for heavy load bushwhacks. They simply are not flexible enough for average long distance trail hikes with light to mid weight packs. That said~ I won't leave home without mine~ absolute bulletproof support and stability. 
2,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These boots continue to amaze me!!  Firstoff~ break-in is best accomplished with a series of short climbs with much vertical.  It took my achilles a while to get used to the extremely stiff shank and my boney heels suffered a few blisters as my soft skin wasn't accustomed to being pitted against a steel shank.  After leather begins to become more forgiving the Makalu fits like a glove.  Superfeet insoles compliment the boots very well.   The Makalu is the only boot that I could find that is hardcore enough to stand up to everything Montana can throw.  From kicking steps up steep snowfields to downclimbing through waterfall formed crevasses to traversing talus fields these boots have never let me down. With a couple applications of Nikwax I have never gotten wet even the sligtest bit while walking through streams and wet snow crossings.  The only wear these boots have shown so far is  a bit bit of rubber missing on the outside and inside of the  large lugs of the Vibram Cluzaz sole from edgeing on knarly rock. I can't wait to step into some crampons.   These boots are well worth the investment especially if you can get them on sale!!  They'll last forever!!
3,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   My playground resides 120KM west -- the Canadian Rockies. I spent the 3 months leading up to spring break searching for a boot. I visited every store that sold outdoor gear in Calgary and came up empty handed. My last resource was Banff National Park. This is not a place to buy gear if you are on a budget. Typically~ costs in this resort town are 15-20% higher than the city. I paid $380.00 for the Makalu~ $45.00 for gas on the first trip~ then $45.00 again for the second trip because they put a size 10 in the box instead of an 11.    My first outing was on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. Spent the summer hiking. I blessed my boots every time I laid them to rest at the end of the day. Knarly roots~ rocks~ and slick trails make up the rain forrest floor. These boots performed very well. They are extremely supportive in the ankle area therefore you may want to loosen the laces on long (2KM or more) uphill hikes and tighten going down. I never had to do this though.    Make sure you visit the LaSportiva web site and use the products they recommend for leather protection. I found wetting the boot and then applying the product works the best. This process of leather protection will darken the color of your boots slightly. The other way to apply the leather protectant is to apply directly from the bottle on dry leather surface. If you follow this method your boots will turn a very dark brown color. I have used both methods and have found they equally work well. I was fond of the tan color when I bought them though. I have stood in streams while filtering water and experienced no water penetration into the boots. Why was I buying Gore Tex boots?    After spending so much money I was fanatical about keeping my boots clean. I had a concern about the fuzzy leather surface of these boots. Other makers have a very smooth surface. At some sections of the trail mud coated the entire boots. I was certain I would not be able to remove it and that my boots would stain. I stood in a stream and the wet mud washed off. Boots looked brand new. I have removed dry mud in my shower with a little elbow grease and again~ boots turn out looking like new. While I have spent well over $400.00 CDN for these boots~ I have never had a moment of reservation.
4,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,"   I've never owned a pair of boots that fit my feet this well.  My feet are low volume~ medium width with a smallish heel.  Out of the box I had a hot spot on the outside of my right foot~ but that went away as the boots broke in.  Break in went pretty quickly~ but about 15~000 vertical feet were covered during the 50 miles that it took me to break the boots in.  Less vertical mileage will probably result in a longer break-in period.  Getting the boots wet will definitely speed up the break-in process.  I still have to tape my heels to avoid blisters -- that's a result of my soft skin and the relatively flex-free midsole.     Those remarks out of the way~ the Makalu's are about as perfect a boot as I can imagine.  The uppers support the ankle so well~ it's amazing.  The well padded collar lets you crank the laces as tight as you like without pinching or hot spots.  I read it over and over here before I bought my Makulus ""if they fit your feet~ buy them.""  I firmly believe that.  Traction with these boots is amazing.  Spent a weekend walking on wet rocks and never had a problem.  No traction on ice~ but any boot needs crampons on ice.  This boot is now my first pick for heavy backpacking~ mountaineering and off-trail bushwhacking.  They're overkill for hiking~ but what do you expect~ one boot to do everything?!  ;-)"
5,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I have to admit that I fell in love with these boots once I put them to the test.  I went on a NOLS wilderness course (30 days in the Wind River Range of Wyoming) this past summer and these boots survived to tell the tale. As far as support~ I've never heard of a better boot at such a great price; they saved my ankles numerous times when traversing unstable boulder fields with a 75lb pack.  Not to mention how well they did in the snow and river crossings.  However~ if you're planning a long trip where you might encounter snow and wet conditions~ expect your feet to get wet.  I waterproofed these boots up the ying yang~ but that all wears off after a week or so of day-long travel in snow and wet conditions.     I'm a big guy (about 230lbs) so the break in period wasn't all that long~ and I only got one blister~ but these boots did remind me of ski boots when I first tried them on.     Despite the original stiffness~ I have to highly reccomend these boots if you're looking for a heavy weight backpacking or moderate mountaineering boot; they'll withstand anything and it seems they are going to last forever.
6,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,"   I am planning to apply for a job at NOLS or Outward bound and have been told by several different sources that these are the boots that are used by most of the instructors and are one of the boots required for students for their trips. I have been shopping for boots for 2 months and theses are the best for what they are built for.    For some~ they have a quirkie fit because they are a higher volume boot. From what I have read~ heard and experienced they should fit: (With a thick sock and sock liner) Laced tight there should be room in the toes. They should not hit the front of the boot on a down hill slope. They should not slip more than a 1/4 of an inch in the heel. But~ they are going to slip~ until they get broken in. The reason is that your foot is going to flex therefore your heel is going to move some. The boots are like boards until they break in and they are going to flex very little if any at first. If you have to chose between a size go for the 1/2 size larger. You can also put ""superfeet"" insoles to take up volume and/or ""5-6 irons"" to do the same.    These are really good boots so don't give up hope if they don't fit perfect the first five minutes in the store. Lastly~ these are not the only boots out there. If they just don't work for your foot get something else. I would suggest trying other brands at the same time anyway to compare fit. Good luck."
7,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   I have the 1997 model of the Makalu and it is much improved over the 1996 model.  The new double-density Vibram Clusaz outsole has much deeper welts than the Calgary sole~ and it holds a crampon very well.  Everything is basically bigger on the new model; the leather is thicker~ the midsole is made of thicker polyurethane (Hydrel) than the old nylon midsole~ and the shank is thicker.  These changes combine to make the boot a lot stiffer than the 1996 model~ further improving its crampon performance.  They also replaced the calfskin lining with a Cambrelle one. The new midsole material requires no break-in period - unlike the Nylon version - only the uppers need it.     Initially I found that the roughout leather was soft~ but after several moist outings and about three applications of Nikwax~ they toughened up and became very water resistant.     Walking on flat ground is uncomfortable.  After a while they develop a very small amount of flex~ and there is some rocker built into the sole~ but these are not trail boots. They are better on rough trails~ and better yet off the trail when the stiffness and ankle support become more important.  On snow they are absolutely delightful.  They are also excellent running down scree.   The toe box is pretty small~ and if I hadn't sized my boots for use with Thorlo's and liners~ I'd be a little crunched. As it is~ I can't replace the thin insoles with anything a little more cushy.    Another problem that my boots have is that the Vibram soles are very hard wearing~ but it may be a little too hard.  Small chunks of rubber have broken off a number of the lugs~ and if the problem persists I will have to contact La Sportiva about it.  Otherwise~ I have no complaints.   Let me say again~ these are not good backpacking boots. They're far too heavy~ stiff~ and warm for such duty. However~ for light mountaineering they really come into their own.  As long as the approach is not too dull~ these boots excel in moderate conditions ( -15 ^C).  Add supergaitors and VB socks~ and you can even go beyond that.
8,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   Like someone said here~ one boot to get you from the car to the top of a snowy mountain.   The new crampon toe groove in the '97s is great -- I can't throw even an ice crampon~ no matter how much I twist and thrash.   A bit fatiguing for extended front-pointing~ due to the flex~ but stiff enough (I weigh 150 lbs) for a short pitch of german or thin alpine rock.  (I am not a very good rock climber~ but didn't do much worse in the Makalus than in my rock shoes)   And they climb rock a lot better than approach shoes or my Sundowners!   I fit a lot of boots at the outdoor shop I work at~ and the Makalu does seem to be a quirky fit~ due to its very low volume.  Either it fits exactly right or it fits like hell -- unlike a OS Moraine~ there is not a lot of interior volume to accomodate a wide range of foot shapes.   Unlike just about anything heavier (Scarpa Manta~ Assault~ K3~ Nepal Tops~ Super Mtn Guides~ etc)~ I can't imagine it will do very well on waterfall ice (I will find out as soon as it forms!) but you can comfortably *walk* miles in them.   Bottom line:  a quirky fit~ but a good general use boot for climbing mountains.  There are better choices for backpacking or ice climbing.
9,la-sportiva,makalu,3.5,   Comfy.. but not built to last. I do a lot of hiking in Hawaii and these boots dissolve on the basalt lava flows. I had to get them resoled after owning them for four months. The boots are not waterproof either.    That said~ they are really comfortable and sturdy on uneven terrain. My complaint could be more with the vibram soles which cuts like butter on the lava.
10,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I am an apprentice powerlineman. My foreman recommended these boots and I have never climber in anything better. I never plan on buying another pair of boots. I have also worn them on several Colorado 14ers and have no complaints. Best boots I have ever worn.
11,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   I bought the boots in 2000~ so it is the older type of these tough moonwalkers. No toe protector~ and it is with vibram outsole not with the MPE.   I have been using this in every second weekend for daytrips~ and one or two times a year for 1-2 weeks long trips.    The breaking time is very very long~ I think I needed around 1 month of daily walking in it before I allowed myself to use it an expedition. For me the insoles are very hard~ I replaced them with a GEL type of insole~ it serves well.    It is brutally waterproof~ I mean the gore-tex and syntethic~ half-leather solutions after a while will allow water in. I just always bring a newspaper with myself what I put in during the evening~ I cure the boots with nickwax~ if it is snow and muddy wet terrain I use pig or seal grease. Once I used a kind of wax~ from this time my boots are discoloured and the metal parts~ shoelace holes became greenish.   The lace system is not the best~ takes time to lace up.      All in all~ I always use double socks~ even during the summer and I have never ever had any blisters. I have better boots than this~ but nothing is tougher and more durable. This one is undestroyable.    If your aim is more vertical than horizontal I can give five stars~ but as I used it everywhere~ I just give 4.
12,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   Good boot~ most comfortable around under $500. Biggest design flaw is the third shoelace eyelet down from the top; it is a fabric/nylon loop (the type found on rock climbing slippers) that will probably give out and wear through or pull out around year 3 or 4.
13,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I purchased the Makalu in the mid '90s and I still wear them. My Asolo boots blew out and I had to use these on a duck hunting trip last month (over 10 years later).     I've had many different brand of boots and I have not found a single brand that can stand up to the beating I throw them. This is the only boot that has lasted as long and strong.   The only drawback is the break-in time. If you can't tough it out for the first month of use~ you're not going to like this boot. All that tough leather takes time to conform to your foot.
14,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Reviews you read on the Makalu are either love or hate affairs. I love my Makalus. Basically La Sportiva uses lasts that fit my foot (which is long narrow and 'low volume' boot speak for flat feet I think!!). I took my time getting the right size and tried on three pairs from a 46.5 to a 47.5 before selecting a pair of 47's. I chucked out the supplied insoles and use a pair of sorbothane insoles which seem to do the job. A bit of wall kicking was in order (simulating front pointing with crampons and decending downhill) to see if my toes hit the end of the boot.   A weekend of tenative walking around the house and they felt fine. The lacing locks work really well and the boots are well made and lovingly crafted. Way better than my Garmont boots which these have now replaced. Their first outing in the mountains was the Tongariro Crossing a 17km hike over an alpine trail in the Mountains of New Zealand's North Island. No blisters and comfort straight from the box.    Subsequent forays have been equally impressive. They kick steps in hard snow with ease hike up or down hill with superb sure footedness and take my Charlet S12 newmatic crampons with ease. Can there be a finer boot for general mountaineering?    At some point I'm going to have to reproof them but not for a while yet. Combined with a decent gaiter they have kept my feet toasty warm and dry as a bone in: snow~ bogs and stream and river crossings. A very~ very good boot. You just need the feet to fit them. Hopefully La Sportiva never stops making them.
15,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   The Makalu may not be the latest and greatest from Sportiva but I just had to comment on it since it's treated me very well.   My Makalus have been used for two years of hiking in Ontario along with four years of scrambling in the Canadian Rockies. Anyone who's scrambled/climbed in the Rockies will know that the terrain is extremely harsh on boots. Going through a pair of boots per year isn't even a surprise. Well~ with that being said~ my Makalus have performed quite well.   During the last four years~ I've scrambled over 50 mountains consisting of snow~ scree~ hard packed dirt~ scree and more scree using these boots and they've never let me down. The soles are finally starting to wear thin but other than that the boots are still going strong. Sure~ I've had to waterproof them a few times but the workmanship is obvious as there isn't even a single stich that has come undone.
16,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   This pair is my second pair. From climbing 5.8 rock~ M3 or WI4~ ferrying 70-100 pound loads to basecamp~ doing 8hr days of backcountry ski trails maintenance through bogs and over and under slippery logs come rain or shine...it is amazing to me how tough and reliable thse boots are while keeping my feet warm and nearly always dry. The break in on this second pair was much better than the first leather lined pair I had. The fabric liners break in more easily and after three and a half years they still have all their lining material.   My first pair served me well from 1995 through 2002 without a resole and under similar demands from me. The break-in period was a few blisters over 37 miles long...but after that they never gave me a moment's trouble...even when frozen at -18F on a Nice WI3 route 4 miles from the road.
17,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These boots are awesome! Slight break-in period with help of a boot stretcher (one hot spot). I backpack with heavy loads (60-80lbs.) OFF the trails and the Makalu supports my feet and ankles perfectly. The Makalu is a heavy boot~ and if you're used to sport hikers~ light loads and easy trails~ these boots aren’t for you. However if you get off the trails and ramble the mountains hunting and camping you can trust your life with these boots.  
18,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I was lucky enough to buy these boots for $165; they are the newest model. I have used them for about one year and they have never let me down. I walked through a river that had ice chunks floating through it in the middle of winter and they still kept my feet warm along with my wool socks. I would recommend these boots to anyone.
19,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These boots have gone through three years of winter camping~ backpacking and over two dozen scrambles in the Canadian Rockies and they've never let me down. They stick to the rock like glue and they provide excellent support for my feet.
20,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   There was a break-in period~ but after they are the best boots I have ever had. I work for the forest service and wear them daily. I love them.
21,la-sportiva,makalu,3.0,   Still in the break-in period~ mainly due to the fact that my first pair had to be sent back.  What looked like a shank started to come through in the front part  on both boots so a replacement was sent to me.  I then got my new Makalu's and found that they had sent me the new models ( I had the previous model without the rubber covered front section).  These are by fare a lot less stiff which is a little bit of a concern.  I don't mind putting in the hard yards breaking them in~ and the new boots flexed  allot quicker than I expected when hiking out to Mt Feathertop. I hope this doesn't affect the use of snowshoes or crampons and time will tell if they stuff up again.  But overall boot looks and feels great.
22,la-sportiva,makalu,1.0,   SPENT TWO WEEKS IN BC~ CANADA AND HATED THESE BOOTS!! rach I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TAKING ABOUT? THESE BOOTS ARE LIKE WEARING A PIECE OF WOOD ON YOUR FEET!
23,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   I am on my second pair. I walk about 130 km a month in the Drakensberg in South Africa at altitudes up to 11~500 ft~ mostly off-path. First pair broke after 7 months. Nylon midsole delaminated from outer sole on both shoes.   Second pair has lasted longer and was much more comfortable with new lining. I have broad feet but no problems. This boot gives more secure footing on rough terrain (grass slopes and scree) than any other I have owned and still flexible enough to walk properly.   Can also use for ice-climbing but a bit too flexible to front-point properly.  I just think they could use better glue to stick them together (e.g. Liquisole instead of the cheap stuff they use). The boots are cold in snow but very waterproof in cold conditions. Not so waterproof in warm rainy weather (2 hrs max.)   In spite of the problems I will still buy another pair~ preferably the Gore-Tex lined version!!!
24,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Don't know what that Timothy guy is on about -- best boots I've ever owned.  If you want a boot for all occasions~ this is it - just as happy up Mont Blanc or trudging through a peat bog.
25,la-sportiva,makalu,1.0,   I WENT FOR A THREE MONTH HIKING EXPEDITION IN SOUTH EAST ALASKA~ AND THESE BOOTS FELL APART. AFTER A SLIGHTLY PAINFUL 4 WEEK BREAK-IN PERIOD ON SOME OF THE ROUGHEST TRAILS IN ALASKA ON THE 6 WEEK BOTH OF THE 1.5mm FULL SHANK BROKE~ ON THE 7 WEEK A HUGE HOLE OPENED UP ON THE SIDE OF MY LEFT BOOT. I CAME TO A LIITLE TOWN 100 MILES SOUTH OF JUNEAU~AK AND BOUGHT ME A PAIR OF HERMAN SURVIVORS FOR $50.25 TO FINISH OUT MY EXPEDITION. LET ME TELL YOU~ THOSE HERMANS HAD NO BREAK-IN PERIOD AND~ THEY NOT ONLY LASTED THE REST OF MY TRIP BUT I STILL WEAR THEM TODAY~ AND I HAVE BEEN BACK FOR 4 MONTHS.  BEWARE OF LA SPORTIVA QUALITY.
26,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Others have said that this boot takes a long time to break in~ and I would disagree. I believe that you either have the foot for this boot~ or you don't~ plain and simple. I happen to have a very crappy foot for fitting most boots: long~ narrow and low volume (low instep). But~ it seems that this is precisely the foot type that fits perfectly with the Makalu! These boots fit me right away~ with no break in required (by this~ I mean that there was no period of suffering through painful blisters in order to get them to mold to my foot)~ only a modest amount of wear before trail use should suffice... FOR THE RIGHT FOOT TYPE.    Believe me~ I've had horrible boot fittings before (see reviews for the Merrel Grand Traverse M2... absolutely horrible boot that was more expensive than the Italian made Makalu)~ and it sucks if the boot doesn't fit.    My recommendation: go to REI and try on the Montrail Morraine and the La Sportiva Makalu... these have very different fits... one will fit better than the other... you'll know which kind of foot you have by your decision in this experiment.    Also~ be sure to get an after market footbed. Most mountaineering shoe companies are expecting you to pick up one of these~ so they don't bother with making their standard one very good. The green Superfeet seems to be the insert of choice for most. Consult a knowledgable footwear specialist and ask them about this.
27,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,"   I sincerely hope this product doesn't dissapear from the face of the market as other such products which are ""too"" good!  Since 1990 I have owned eight or so pairs of heavy leather boots and put them through alot of the conditions which exist below 4000 feet and none excel in as wide a multitude of enviorments as the Makalu!"
28,la-sportiva,makalu,1.0,   I bought these boots about 2 years ago and haven't had a winter season since. These boots have to be the most terrible thing I have ever worn. I suspect it may be my weird foot shape as some people seem to love them~ however I have heard others who bought a pair complain that they just couldn't get on with them.   I broke them in (or rather they broke me in) over a period of a year and a half and they never became comfortable. I tried volume adjusters~ different footbeds~ had them cooked at the local mountaineering shop and the heels narrowed~ all to no avail.   I just purchased a pair of Scarpa Mantas which seem comfortable for now~ but time will tell.   If you're looking for a new pair of boots I recomend you look at getting your Makalus a little small as part of the problem I had was the increased volume in the boot once the internal padding was tramped into submission.
29,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   My first La Sportiva boot was the regular hiking model similar to the Makalu. I wore them on two trips and liked them and than returned them for the crampon-accepting and slightly heavier duty Makalu Ladies. The men's boots seem to have too much interior volume for my feet and didn't fit as well as the ladies version. These boots were the only ones that straight out of the box felt incredibly comfortable.    The one major hike I did with them since I got the Makalu's I duct taped my heels and only got small blisters on the inside of my heels. Not a bad deal considering that I deserved worse for taking them straight out on a hike with zero break-in time before the hike. Considering~ they were super on the hike and treated me well. I used them on a hike in the Rahwah Wilderness in CO were the trail gained about 2500' of elevation in 7 miles and was fairly rocky with quite a few stream crossings.    The other boots that I tried prior to the La Sportiva's were the green Montrails and however cool looking they were waaay too high volume for my feet and even a snug fit back to front gave me a sloppy side to side fit and blister-producing friction. The Makalu's are definitely a heavy-duty boot  with the full steel shank and 3mm leather upper but I like a tough boot that will stand up to a beating and support my tired feet through the last mile. I did put waterproofing Nikwax on my boots that was provided to me in the box with the boots and it did turn my boots a darker brown but they still look cool. They are now impervious to water and dirt can be wiped off.    My friend has the men's version and he seems to like his boots as much as I like mine and both of us tried on a ton of boots before deciding to stick with the La Sportiva's. Their customer service seemed really helpful when I called and asked some questions about their boots before I bought them~ haven't had to call yet with any problems.    I also put in a pair of Superfeet insoles and that helps out a lot in any boot. It gives you a more supported instep and hugs your heel better than a standard insole. Check them out~ they are sold at most EMS and REI type stores.
30,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   By far the most comfortable boots I've ever owned. I used to be a big fan of Sundowners~ but these are even better. I have a low profile foot~ but the boots fit very well. Suprisingly required very little break-in time. Strong soles (Vibram) that can be re-soled. You cannot go wrong with these boots!
31,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These are the best boots I've ever worn. But I couldn't wear 'em for very long periods until they were broken in. I also have plantar fasciitis (heal spurs) and these boots seemed to have been the cure for that. I can wear 'em for days on end where my other boots hurt after a day or two. I've tried Garmont~ Racklie~ Merrells...and Scarpa (also great!!) but the legendary Makalus have lived up to their reputation.   Only caveat is that they are not super warm boots... but I've found that two layers of wool socks (one mountaineering like Smartwools and medium hiking sock) seemed to cure that... but below zero F. these might not be adequate unless you're constantly on the move. I am tempted to buy AT ski bindings so I can use 'em for even that. Solid footbed that evens out the bumps in the Mountains. And stiffer than my Scarpa leather telemark boots.
32,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   IT SEEMED TO TAKE FOREVER TO GET THESE LITTLE DARLINGS TO GET TO THE RIGHT FIT. NOW THAT THEY ARE THERE I HOPE THEY LAST FOREVER BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST COMFORTABLE REAL BOOTS I HAVE EVER HAD. THE  TIME TO BREAK THEM IN IS THE ONLY REAL NEGATIVE. LUV EM NOW
33,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   I have considerably wide feet~ but it did not cause any harm or hot-spots. Boot was quite comfortable~ but I had to sell it because of freezing feet unfortunately boots came up to be at least half of number too small and with crampions it did get cold even at low altitudes 4000 m. Nice boot for Alps but I dont belive it works higher~ also boot hight is somewher between high and medium. dear to reccommend for nice trips where you need stable and comfortable walking boot.
34,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I've got funny feet - they're wide at the ball but narrow at the heel with a high arch.  These boots fitted first off due to the unique fit system~ being a bit stiff at first i got one small hot spot on the one heel but i was not tightening the boot onto my foot properly.  Done correctlyy it holds your heel in place very securely - not a bit of movement there while your arch is not crushed and your toes can wiggle.  The best boots I've ever owned.
35,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   Very good boot.   Alpinism in the Alpi Marittime. No good in snow.   Makalu souffered rain.
36,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   These boots have proven great on the trail. the quality is outstanding~ and i know they will last a long time. the break in period takes a long time though so be very patient with these boots.......blisters will be suffered the 1st 2 or 3 trips
37,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   This boot was my next step after wearing out two sets of Vasque Gore-Tex hikers. With Shasta~ Hood~ and Ranier on my horizon~ I have relied on the Makalu II as my choice~ instead of plastic boots. Easy break-in period~ waterproof~ and crampon-ready~ this boot is a good value for the money. A hand-made Italian paw that's worth every penny.
38,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Stiff but supportive~ hard to break in but worth the effort (although my wife found hers comfy right out of the box~ go figure). I use mine alot with snowshoes/crampons for winter hiking/climbing in the Adirondaks~ Whites~ and Catskills~ the stiff uppers let you cinch the bindings down tight without cutting off circulation. Pretty warm~ even warmer with supergaiters. Gear I'm glad I own.
39,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Great boots!  They did take a long time to break in and I still tape my heels on long trips but they are pretty comfortable now.  Completely weather-proof if treated well (Nikwax aqueous) and will probably outlive me.  I'm looking forward to doing some light mountaineering with them this season.  Overall a well-constructed boot that will take you just about anywhere through any conditions.
40,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   So far it's been a very good boot.  Four trips to 10~000+ in snow/rain so far this winter and the feet have stay warm & dry.  Definitely waterproof these boots thoroughly before use.  The breakin has been murder on my heels~ big blisters~ advise the use of some moleskin on the heels from the first day until broken in.  They accept step-in crampons and the black diamond's work well with this boot.  If you plan on doing any extended glacier travel or real cold stuff~ you will want more than this boot~ but for general mountaineering it holds up fine.
41,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I have not had one problem with these boots.  I take a size 13.5 and I have thouroughly enjoyed them.  They feel even better with a spenco arched insole. Even after a 13 hour day on Long's Peak I had no blister or even sore spots.  I do keep to toe box laces loose to allow for bigger sox and less constriction~ but they still perform very well and their grip in the cold on bare rock is fantastic.  A fabulous all-around boot.
42,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Great boots! I bought these for a backcountry trip in the Sierra Nevada~ and they were excellent for the purpose. Great ankle support for scrambling~ but not so stiff that trail hiking is uncomfortable. I wore these for a week before my trip~ and they were pretty much broken in within a few days of starting. No blisters~ except some slight chaffing at the ankle~ which was not a problem. Very comfortable for the support they provide. Good with step-in crampons.
43,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   I bought my Makalu's last spring and have been trying to break them in ever since. I've climbed Mt Shasta twice in them. I got nasty blisters on my heals both times even after wrapping my heel in duct tape. They will be awsome after I break them in. They performed beautifully on steep snow and ice. Make sure you waterproof them before wearing them in the snow. I didn't waterproof mine before my first Shasta trip and my feet were soaked after 1 hour in the snow. Later during that same trip my boots froze and caused my feet to go numb. I've since waterproofed them with Nikwax and Biwell green. My feet were completely dry during my last Shasta climb after waterproofing them.
44,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I purchased these boot around Christmastime and couldn't wait to use them. The worked wonderfully in the snow. I keep them water proofed with Nikwax aqueous solution. They kept my feet warm as long as I kept moving.  The use of gaiters will make them even more unstoppable in the snow.   I've also used them in many off trail excursions.  The high ankle support and rigid sole allows you to go anywhere without fear of twisting an ankle or feeling the bite of a bad step.   The biggest test for my boots so far have been 320 miles on the Colorado Trail.  My feet were noticibly worn during the begining of the trip but I attribute that to the nature of the everyday hiking.  Even after 320 miles the only wear on the boots is a small amount of rubber worn off of the sole under the toe from pushing off.   Overall~ a fantastic boot if you have the money.  It will last you forever.  I can't wait to try them on the snow and ice some more this winter.
45,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I had a pair of Solomons that didn't stand up to two years of climbing thru Montana talus fields.  The soles held up fine but the leather uppers wore thru on the outer sides~ so I decided it was time to upgrade to a boot w/thicker leather.  My makalus are a well made boot but I think that they are going to break me in before the damn boots are broken in.  I still get blisters on my heels (I must admit that my heels have always been blister prone) and I get foot sore on the return trip from any day hike (5-16 miles).     That said~ I believe these boots will last me a long time.  I live in Montana & try to go for summits when I hike. (mostly in the Bitterroots).  My first trip in the boots was  a scramble up Trapper Peak ( 10~000+) and the boots performed great on the snow feilds & talus slopes & wet boulders.  We were bushwacking up to the heavenly twins on a subsequent hike and got stuck in some impenetrable undergrowth & blow down~ our only option was a 2 mile hike down thru the creek to get back to the main trail. The boots held up beautifully even though I don't believe the manufacturer intended them to be used that way.   One last note:  I've tried moleskin~ ducttape~ sock liners but still my heels are chewed up after 5 or 6 miles. The fit    was correct in the store & my heel is in tight with the great lacing system but still damn blisters!!! Oh yea~ one other thing:  Expect to initially feel a little clumbsy in these boots if you are used to hiking in lighter backpacking hiking boots these boots are heavy & the sole is very stiff but I guess that is the price u pay for support &    durability.
46,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   The Makalu is a wonderfull boot.  The sole is to stiff for your general day hike~ For extended trips and off trail options~ the makalu performs well.  I have a size 11 1/2 foot that has a skinny heel~ with a low volume instep.  The Makalu is the only boot in this type of backpacking that fits well.  I tried the Salomons super mountain nine~ good boot~ but you need a high volume foot.
47,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These are very good boots. I used the same pair for 5 years now.  They are finally starting to be fairly trashed. Very comfortable.  I have never even gotten a blister despite many miles and climbs with heavy packs.    If they fit your feet~ buy them.
48,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Having heard of these boots to be the best for off trail/ mountaineering use~ I decided to try them out.  I purchased a pair on sail at REI and was not dissatisfied.  Quite clearly the best price for boot~ durability~ materials~ ect.  They are the best boots in my closet and my first choice for the trail.
49,la-sportiva,makalu,1.0,   I wish to state for the record so that there is no confusion about this - La Sportiva has the worst customer service of any outdoor company I have ever dealt with.    I purchased a pair of Makalu's because they looked great and felt good upon fitting. After one year I went through 3 !!! pairs because the shank kept breaking in the right boot. You can tell when you have broken a shank by the popping sound as you walk. I went through a year of hell with La Sportiva trying to replace them.   The first time my local outfitter ate the cost and replaced them. The second time I had to mail them in to La Sportiva at my own cost~ had to fight their beauracracy after which at the end of a month they sent my original pair of boots back and declined to replace them.   The third time I just found an outfitter who exchanged them for One Sport Morraines.   I will never deal with La Sportiva again.   If you are interested in buying a serious pair of boots~ I recommend Asolo. They have excellent customer service and the boots they make are the best in the business.
50,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Amazing boots if you take the time to break them in.    Off trail/rough trail performance is fantastic.    Awesome ankle support so heavy packs aren't a problem.   Also great with crampons and supergaiters deck them out for light winter use.
51,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   My wife actually just got a pair of these. She's only used them on one trip so far. She loves the fit; it's the first boot that has actually fit her properly (she's got bizarre feet; narrow heel~ no arch~ looongggg middle toe).     We went scrambling following a 4 km hike and she had absolutely no problems~ blisters~ etc. Maybe the new cambrelle lining in the 97 model helps~ I don't know.
52,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These are the best pair of boots that I have ever had.   They work well for hiking and are killer on snow and ice.
53,la-sportiva,makalu,4.0,   If it fits and your looking for a heavy duty backpaking/mountaineering boot this is the boot for you. I strongly suggest that you make sure you get a good fit before you purchase this (or any) boot because this is a serious boot that will not give much to a bad fit. Be patient~  these babys took a long (but not painful) time to tame. These are the newest version of the boot which I believe are superior to the originals.
54,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   i love these boots! they really do it all~ no wonder the american alpine inst. gave them a guides choice.    after having all kinds of problems with my asolo globalines~ i decided to replace them with a real boot~ i can tell that i will have this pair for a long~ long time. my only wish is that they had a pulley laceing system like the globalines (that was the only thing that worked well on that boot~ but that is another story.) i cant wait to get them on ice next year!
55,la-sportiva,makalu,2.0,   I have tried to wear these boots several times with several different sock combination~ and I have ended up with blisters within a couple miles every time.  There is a lot of slippage in the heel because the boots don't give at all.  This is not a boot for trail work or any kind of distance.
56,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Well~ these boots kick butt.  However I have not yet fully broken them in yet.  I was lucky and bought last years model (1996) for only $176.00 on sale.  I treated the outside with Nikwax and the inside leather with saddle soap per the man.    suggestion.  I have stomped through streams~ mud and snow and I didnt even get close to getting my feet wet.  If you want a boot that can get you from the car to the top of a snow covered mountain~ these are it.
57,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   I blew out a pair of Vasque Alpines~ and decided to try the La Sportiva Makalu.  What a great switch.  These boots do it all.  I've put many miles on them already and this winter. I've used them in replace of my Double boots (on warmer days) climbing vertical waterfall ice since they accept step ins.  I had to adjust the bails of my footfangs a little for proper fit.  I'm very pleased with them.  I wouldn't even have considered using my Alpines on vertical ice.  Keep them properly waterproofed and your feet will stay dry in all but the wettest of conditions.  I highly recommend these boots for looking for a high quality leather boot.
58,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   The Makalu is the best boot I've come across in a long time~ and I've been looking at many pairs since my Vasque Sundowners got shredded by the talus of the Canadian rockies.   The Vibram sole~ high rand~ full-grain leather uppers~ and calf-skin lining suggest a boot that will outlive me.  The break-in period may be long~ but it will seem like no time at all when you've worn them for ten years~ which would be the minimum life span I would predict.  I have heard nothing but rave reviews from the few people I have talked to who own them already.  La Sportiva says they're step-in crampon compatible~ but considering the sole flex~ I would not recommend this except when they are brand new.
59,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   These boots are great for rough and steep trails with a heavy pack or for off trail use.  They also perform extremely well on moderate climbs.  If you are in a very wet area be advised that without gore-tex~ they will only keep you dry as long as you use a good treatment on them. (I use Biwell and it works ok until too many stream crossings wear it down).
60,la-sportiva,makalu,5.0,   Forgive me if I sound like I work for LaSportiva but these are the best boots on the planet. I bought them mail order~ wore them in the house and they felt fine.   However~ they turned out to be too small once I began downhill clods with a full pack. I still love them even though I can't wear them. (If  I can sell them~ I would instantly buy another pair).   They are fully waterproof~ rubber randed~ and accept step-in crampons.
61,scarpa,inverno,4.5,   A good general purpose mountaineering boot. After a few years~ I purchased insulated high-altitude liners that substantially increase their warmth. Because they are stiff~ it is very important to lace them while leaning forward to avoid shin bang.  heavier and more clunky to walk in than the more recent leather mountaineering boots~ but more likely to keep your toes intact in persistent sub-zero temperatures.     Pros   Cons   UPDATE:   a year or two after I wrote the original review below~ i purchased the insulated liners.  they make a huge difference in keeping your feet warm.  they also occupy more volume~ meaning I tend not to wear them with expedition-weight socks for the most part.  i think the Inverno is only sold with insulated boot liners now.   what i learned over time is that the key to avoiding 'shin bang~' a known bugaboo with these boots~ is that it's best to lace the upper section of the outer boot while leaning forward~ bending your knee.  that gives you enough leeway to keep your shins happy and helps them feel a little less like walking in ski boots~ especially in the snow.  I also find it helps to lace them up and go for a couple of walks at home in the weeks before using them on a trip~ so my feet and legs get used to them.  i have never gotten blisters in these boots but have occasionally lost toenails when i laced the lower section too loosely on a very cold day with a lot of down-hiking.    with the warm liners~ i no longer use these with overboots in the White Mountains and feel they can handle virtually any weather lower 48 states can dish out.  Laced as described~ these work nicely not only for climbing in crampons~ but also snowshoeing in very cold conditions.  If I were inclined to climb something very cold at high altitudes~ i would feel compelled to pair these with a pair of forty below overboots and would think hard about one of the boot/gaiter combos like the scarpa phantom 8000~ millet's everest boots~ or lowa's expedition 8000.    my original review appears below.    * * *   I purchased these lightly used for winter hiking and climbing. they are a double boot~ plastic exterior shell with an inner insert~ similar construction to a downhill ski boot. the inner boot laces up separately from the outer boot and can be easily removed used to walk around in a cabin~ tent~ or snow instead of a bootie.   My primary use has been at and around Mount Washington~ the Presidentials in New Hampshire. i have used them to walk on snowy trails~ with automatic/step-in crampons~ and with snowshoes~ and they work extremely well at all three of these.   The only place they don't work so well is dry trail~ where the stiffness tends to feel clunky and uncomfortable. if you anticipate any significant amount of dry trail walking~ bring a light pair of hiking shoes.   Fit is a little tricky~ important to try them on. The sizing is not exactly the same as normal US sizes~ and the plastic shells are sold in whole sizes only; variation of the size of the inner boot accounts for their availability in half-sizes.   In terms of comfort~ these boots are significantly stiffer than a normal heavy hiking boot~ so take the time to get used to them. they don't really 'break in~' but your feet and shins need to get used to them. shin bruising can be an issue; i have successfully avoided that by loosening the inner laces or not using the top set of eyelets on the inner boot~ and that works fine. keeping them too loose can leave your toes banging the front of the boot on steep downhills.   for the coldest weather~ well below zero~ the regular inner boot isn't warm enough for me~ and i tend to run warm. i have worn them on hikes in -20 fahrenheit without frostbite~ but my toes were pretty numb.   Scarpa sells a fairly expensive 'high altitude' or 'alveolite' liner that is probably a lot warmer - i wonder whether it would take up more volume and change the sock combination; it's worth testing if you get the cold-weather liners.   i have~ so far~ opted to use insulated overboots instead (mountain hardwear absolute zero~ but outdoor research and forty below have great overboots too). with overboots~ i think these boots will probably work in just about any conditions. one issue with overboots generally~ step-in crampons don't work too well~ so better to bring strap-in crampons if you may use overboots.
62,scarpa,inverno,4.5,   Standard double-plastic mountaineering boot with high altitude liner is good enough for technical ice climbing and comfortable enough for snow slog approaches. Ready for the winters of the White Mountains~ glaciers of the western ranges~ or altitude of the Himalaya.   Pros   Cons   Fit: True to size. Make sure the salesperson in the store is knowledgeable on Euro vs American sizing. Mine was not the first time around and I ended up getting something way too big.   Comfort: I have had only a couple of hot spots from rubbing with these boots~ and I got rid of that by adjusting my laces and using mole skin if I knew I had long approach hikes. Comfortable when ice climbing.   100% support of ankle and foot   Waterproof plastic   Great grip for snow and rock   Temp control: Very warm~ I typically switch socks out during an overnight because my feet sweat in these things.   Very durable after 3 seasons of hard use~ still in excellent condition.
63,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   Scarpa's Inverno is a classic. They've dialed in a simple~ efficient double boot system that just flat works. The cordura liners are the base model and work well for low angle~ low altitude approach or glacier travel. The high altitude liners add a lot of warmth~ but with the advent of Intution Denali liners...there's no comparison. These liners will lighten your whole system by more than a pound- well worth the investment.   I use the Scarpa Inverno for alpine climbing~ glacier travel approach~ backcountry skiing (in a pinch) and they hold up well.    As a woman~ it can be interesting getting men's gear to fit comfortably: in this case~ the right liners are the key. Once you've established the right fit for the plastic shell~ get a custom liner dialed in and you're good to go.   For toasty warm (and dry) toes in the coldest climates and gnarliest snow conditions~ go with the tried and true Scarpa.
64,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   Great all-around mountaineering boot! The liners are warm~ comfortable and dry quickly. The actual hardshell boot is extremely durable and holds up very well -- I was impressed.   Pros   Cons   I  spent up to 12 hours a day climbing in these boot in very cold weather in the Himalayas and my feet stayed warm~ dry and comfortable everyday. I highly recommend these!
65,scarpa,inverno,4.5,   They are a comfortable boot once broken in. I went 1 size bigger and they fit good with two pair socks. They are warm in snow and I have not had cold feet. The reason they didn't get 5 stars is the squeak that goes with them.       They don't seem like you need to tighten them all the time which is good with crampons. They have stayed tight for me up and down the mountain. I feel for the price they are a good deal.
66,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   I have had my Invernos for several years and I love them.  My only complaint is the tongues of the liners finally broke down and the lace rivet rubbed on my shins and caused me a bit of pain. Most likely from using the boot snowboarding and putting too much forward pressure on the tongues. Minor issue compared to the amount of use the boots have seen and the fact that new liners are available.
67,scarpa,inverno,2.0,   Very comfortable~ like slippers in fact. And climb about the same. Easily the least climbable plastic boot I've owned. I've also been through a pair of Koflach Ultras and Asolo 101s~ both climbed better than the Invernos.
68,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   I have worn these boots on twelve ice trips to Smugglers' Notch~  Vermont. They are both very warm~ and very comfortable. For long walk-in's keep the upper laces untied. They fit perfectly with BD makos~ plus the black color will help absorb some heat from the sun.
69,scarpa,inverno,4.0,   These boots are quite comfortable for my wide feet and flat arches~ but for long~ level~ approaches~ I opt to put them on top of the pack and use approach shoes! The boots are quite warm~ even in cold conditions (below freezing) with the regular liners. I have had some problems with the laces being shreaded by the metal grommets -- you may want to carry a spare set of laces on a longer trip. Oh yeah~ don't expect them to be easy for any alpine rock climbing.
70,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   These boots kick ass for cold and snowy conditions.  They are also rigid for vertical ice.  They are comfy and feel very durable.  Since my left foot is at least .5 size larger than my right foot~ I have to stuff the right boots with more socks~ an extra insole~ but seems to keep my heel better in place.  Did great on vertical ice and kept my feet toasty in below zero temps and extreme wind chill.   If you can find these for the 20% clearence~ get them while you can~ otherwise it will be $340 for the '98~ but probably still worth it - KILLER BOOTS!!!!!!
71,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   I was hoping that I could get out in some plastic boots for less but after looking around.......These boots are well worth the money that you pay.  They are pretty plush right out of the box.  The only problem (small) is that I have a narrow heal and am having to work with a shim system to keep my heal where I want it.  Not a problem.  I recommend them to anyone. Very warm as well.  Almost too warm sometimes.  Think about that when the guy at the store is telling you to be able to fit two or three pairs of socks in them.
72,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   I have used about every type of plastic boot there is and this is by for the best do-all boot there is.  It fronts points as good as any if not better~ the rocker sole keeps shin bang at a minimum on the trail~  and they hold on to crampons like glue. The shell is a little bulky for rock but with use you get use to it. Lots of toe room to keep them warm and the ankle tightens up for minimal heel slip.
73,scarpa,inverno,3.0,   I've only used these for a few trips this winter.  Here's my observerations:   o they are heavy compared to leather boots~ or at least they sure feel that way. The two boots together probably weight in at about 10lbs.  It can get pretty tiring~ espcially when you add snowshoes!   o they are very warm   o they do take a bit of getting used to~ walking on bare ground or only a few inches of snow changes your gait   o they provide plenty of ankle support   o these boots are the widest plastic boots I could find~ they fit my foot~ a narrow heel~ wide forefoot~ size 13   o they do all plastic boot things well~ so far as I've noticed   o they have a neat system with a gasket instead of a bellows for closing the tounge.  It seems to work.
74,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   I have worn my Invernos vertical ice climbing and on expeditions above 21~000 feet.  I love them.  They fit American feet better than most boots.  One favorite feature is the large degree of rocker~ or curvature~ of the sole.  This makes the Inverno far more comfortable for hiking without crampons.  Approach hikes and desert training are no problem~ even though the Inverno is stiffer than the really soft plastic boots.  These are complete all-around boots.  They are also about the least expensive boot that can handle extreme cold~ altitude~ and vertical ice.  The Charlet Moser Super 12 crampons fit the soles of these boots perfectly.  These are lightweight~ convenient~ rock solid crampons.  The combination cannot be improved upon.     I did get frostbite in my Invernos during an overnight bivouac high on Mt. Elbrus.  The fault was mine.  I did not have enough clothing to keep my core temperature up.  For extreme cold and high altitude~ you'll need a larger boot than you would want for vertical ice~ so even though the Inverno can do it all~ you would still need two sizes of Invernos to do it all.  For Denali~ I am getting Advanced Base Camp boots (formerly One Sport Everest) in a much large size because those are the boots everyone on Everest uses and I don't want to deal with any more frostbite.  The Invernos will still be my favorites for everything short of Denali or the Himalaya.
75,scarpa,inverno,5.0,"   After trying the Asolo (both home and on the mountain) I bought the Scarpa Inverno instead. These boots are heavy (like all plastic boots) but if you get a good fit~ these are the ""sneakers"" of serious mountaneering boots. Had a chance to try them out hard on Mount Rainier in both blistering sun and cold wet slush. These boots do the job~ but a price that were much higher than I did intend to spend. However~ boots are probably the most important piece of gear and nothing can ruin a trip as much as a pair of illfitting/leaking boots. My vote is for the Scarpas if you can afford them and need a ""serious"" boot."
76,scarpa,inverno,5.0,   I tried several plastic boots~ and these were the only ones that fit comfortably.  I wore them about 10 times on day trips this past winter~ carrying as much as 35 - 40 lbs.  My feet stayed warm~ dry and comforable.   These boots have a gasketed tongue rather than the bellows version found on many plastic and leather boots.  I assume that those plastic bellows will someday fail~ but the gasket looks bombproof~ and keeps out water as well as anything else (I recently found myself ankle deep in a stream~ but my feet stayed dry).   These are very good boots~ but fit is critical; don't buy them if they don't fit in the store.
77,scarpa,inverno,0.5,   I just wore these out to the local park for a 2 mile hike through the snow to test out how well they fit and I saw the heel started to separate from the base.     They are brand new and glad I saw this before I went out on trip with them. I received these as a gift so I don't even know if they are going to be covered by warranty. Bummer :(   
78,mammut,magic-guide-high-gtx,4.5,   Near perfect balance between comfort and fit~ durability~ features and innovation~ grip~ insulation~ support~ sure-footedness~ and weight   Pros   Cons   Handsome looking boots.   Recently purchased these B3 mountain boots for planned late Autumn/Fall expeditions to Alaska~ Northwest Canada~ and Chamonix. So haven't yet tried them out in the frigid conditions they were bought for.   But they have seen some use when engaged in less technical (grades I-II) climbing and scrambling in Northern England and Scotland.         I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonably comfortable they felt when walking~ for up to a couple of hours~ over fairly level ground or gently rising gradients. Especially for such a stiffly soled (B3) mountain specific boot.   Perhaps a little warm for climbing and scrambling during the typical British or Western European climate of the late Spring and Summer months.   To be updated.
79,mammut,magic-guide-high-gtx,5.0,   Tried a lot of the best Italian and USA companies. These blow them away dollar for feature. Mammut hits a home run with these.   Pros   Cons   Outta the box comfortable immediately...!   I'm probably incredibly stoked because I got an amazing deal on these. This is one of those times when it wasn't too good to be true—deal vs product-wise.   Most notably~ heel locking lace system with lace locking lower eyelets. Very lightweight comparably. Semi-auto crampon compatible with top of the line Vibram soles that make a fantastic backpacking long distance boot also. Waterproof uppers with nice scree evading neoprene gaiter~ carbon fiber insulated last makes it light as heck. Lastly~ the color scheme has no neon colors...😒 phew...   These feel like my old Frye boots from the '70s comfort-wise.   Time will tell regarding durability~ but my experience with Mammut's clothing is top notch. Let's hope Raichle made them a good long lasting boot.   Experience   Hiking four seasons in the Northeast since the '70s.
80,la-sportiva,nepal-evo-gtx,4.5,   I have to give these boots mad props (yes I said mad props). Here's the story: I was stupid and had the brilliant idea of traversing Mt. Adams north to south but the catch was I parked my car on the south side forcing me to backpack around the mountain...    Great idea right? Any way I wore these boots for the entire 11 mile trip around the west side of the mountain and although they weren't exactly comfortable~ they didn't destroy my feet either. Ok~ so I thought I'd be clever and not lace them up all the way so I could flex my ankle a bit more which resulted in some blisters~ an easy fix. Once laced correctly they were comfortable~ walked well enough for me chew through the hike in about 8hrs (I could've done better in my tennies).    As far as the climb went they grip rock like a dream. The north ridge of Adams in one giant gravel pile~ and they helped grip the tiny bid of solid rock there was. They kept my feet dry during the numerous stream crossings and gripped the wet rock amazingly as well. The ankle support is very intuitive. I could flex as needed but not so loose that when stumbling on the loose-pile-that-is-the-north ridge-of-Adams my ankles were not injured either.    Obviously they accept crampons~ have a gore-tex lining~ and all that good stuff. I didn't notice my feet being too warm with the duratherm lining but at the end of the day after taking them off~ there was quite of bit of moisture build up.    Bottom Line: Great boot for CLIMBING. Don't try to hike in them. Wear your tennies instead ;P.   There is a glaring downside though: They are heavy~ like 2lbs heavier than than my regular hiking boots.   Oh yeah~ found mine used~ pretty pricey otherwise.   
81,la-sportiva,nepal-evo-gtx,3.0,"   They are absolutely bomber mountaineering boots and I recommend them to any serious mountaineer BUUUUT holy hell do these suckers hurt—so much that on my last climb I joked that hacking off my feet with my ice ax and descending on bloody stumps would be less painful. Wearing them feels like miniature shark attacks (one for each foot).       They are ultra stiff~ full-shank boots so I wasn't expecting them to ever be comfortable~ but after using them nearly year-round for three years I thought they'd be broken in by now. Instead they leave me hobbled for days after a climb.       Unfortunately~ there are few options for women's four-season boots and these fit me better than the others~ which is why I keep wearing them. From now on~ I'll wear approach boots/shoes and only put on the EVOs once I rope up or I'll just leave them at home and wear summer mountaineering boots instead.      Pros   Cons   5-stars for bomberness (that's a word~ right?); 1-star for comfort.   Beefy~ insulated~ and puncture/abrasion resistant boot with silicone impregnated waterproof leather plus a Gore-Tex liner...so yeah~ totally bomber.   Lace-lock system makes lacing highly customizable and ensures there is no heel slip. You can tighten the bottom and top parts of the boot independently—super cool!   Full-shank for steep routes and for ice climbing where front-pointing is necessary. Also good when leading a mountaineering route and have to step-kick for an extended period.   Removable tongue insert for a customized fit.   Stretchy gaiter keeps out snow and debris while also adding warmth.   Great ankle support and a flexible part between the top and bottom of the boot adds bend at the ankle so they are easier to walk in.   Really good sticky sole and edge for scrambling and rock climbing~ and has La Sportiva's ""impact brake system""~ where the lugs of the soles are slanted in oposite directions to minimize slipping.   The only real drawback is that they are pretty heavy. So~ overall~ they are frigging awesome mountaineering boots!   But like I stated above~ comfort is a serious issue for me. I think my feet are a bit wide~ not wide enough to wear wide shoes~ just wide enough to make wearing these boots a traumatic experience. If you have normal feet~ you should probably be good. If you only have sorta normal feet~ then I recommend you consider the fit carefully; otherwise~ you may find that you have the overwhelming urge to jump headfirst in a crevasse to end your suffering."
82,la-sportiva,nepal-evo-gtx,4.5,"   These boots are bomber. They are definitely too stiff for approach hiking~ however they shine bright when put into glacier travel and ice climbing. If you can afford them get them~ otherwise look for some used ones.   Pros   Cons   Fit: They run an accurate size.   Comfort: Once broken in they are great!   Support: Full shank... enough said   Water Resistance: Gore-tex so good   Traction: Surprisingly great   Temp Control: Very good~ however heavy thermal socks recommended for any temps below -5°C.   Ease of Use: Pretty simple~ I like the ""lace lock outs"" at the ankle.   Features: Heel and toe welts for wire bail crampons   Durability: Bomb proof   Conditions: Whiteout storms~ glacier travel~ light trails~ and ice climbing."
83,la-sportiva,nepal-evo-gtx,5.0,"   Best mountaineering boot money can buy~ period.   Pros   Cons   The fit of the boot is excellent. Like most La Sportiva products~ it skews towards those with narrower feet~ but will fit most people with medium width feet just fine. A ""second tongue"" is included~ which allows for people with lower volume feet to customize the fit of the boot.   The boot is quite warm~ probably the best leather boot on the market when it comes to keeping your feet warm~ and the leather gives the boot a more ""satisfying"" feel when climbing than plastic. The incredible rigidity of the sole and upper make this boot excellent for everything from kicking steps to climbing vertical ice. The fact that it accepts automatic crampons is also nice.   The yellow dye in the leather will bleed out when new~ making it look as if a dog has peed in the snow EVERYWHERE that you go. For a while.   Long story short~ this is the best mountaineering boot you can purchase. As it ought to be for the asking price....ouch!"
84,la-sportiva,nepal-evo-gtx,5.0,   Most important for a great all-around mountaineering boot is all day comfort~ which the Nepal EVO GTX excels at. Even though the description does not mention any info about using this boot for technical climbing~ I have found they are very solid for mixed/technical terrain. I highly recommend this boot and they keep my feet toasty!   Pros   The fit is true to size and is uniform to all La Sportiva boots. I have a high arch and use insoles which work very well. The lacing system is efficient at customizing the boot to my foot.    I went on a 14 mile hike in winter with the boots right out of the box and experienced no discomfort. This boot provides very good comfort and support. They are very rigid and have a solid feel which helps climbing steeper inclines.    I have yet to encounter any issues with water leaking in. These have kept my feet 100% dry.    Excellent grip in both snow and dirt but slippery on wet rock.    Keeps feet very warm but can overheat if temps get too high.   Very consistent boots that are very well made and last for years. I bought them in 2009~ used them every winter/spring season and they're durability is amazing. 
85,la-sportiva,nepal-evo-gtx,4.0,   Great all around boot.   Pros   Cons   Good boot. I am currently using them for ice climbing and may use them for mountaineering in the future. They are warm and comfortable. Work well with my BD Cyborgs. Fit is true to size. I just wear a Smartwool ski sock with them and my feet are generally warm enough.   Would recommend.
86,la-sportiva,karakorum,4.5,"   Replaced a pair of long lived Asolo TPS 520s with these in preparation for a mountaineering climb that required crampons. I loved the Asolos but needed something with a more rigid sole.    Pros   Cons   In 1989 I bought my first ""real"" hiking boots. The $80 Vasque boots bragged of full-grain leather~ double-stitched soles~ steel shank~ leather liner~ and Vibram soles. They made me feel like I could go through anything.   They lasted me about 10 years until one of the soles separated from the upper 7 miles up a snowy trail. When I pulled off my gaiters off for the night and saw the front sole of my boot hanging~ I realized why my foot seemed to be getting so wet.   The La Sportiva Krakorums have the same old-school feel without the weight. The 3/4 shank makes these a very rigid boot~ appropriate for off-trail mountain hiking~ summit scrambles~ crampon use~ and snowy terrain. I would not recommend these for backpacking and hiking~ unless your need them for foot comfort.   I've used these boots for about 14 months~ including casual training hikes~ backpacking trips~ mountain summits~ and winter camping. They are definitely not waterproof~ like my previous Asolo boots. After slogging through wet snow~ there is some leakage at the base of the tongue~ but in such conditions I expect my feet to get wet and stay wet until the trek is over~ regardless of the claims of the footwear. After long periods in wet conditions in my Asolo TPS 520s~ my feet would end up wet anyway~ often from the inside due to sweat or from snow getting past the gaiters. (I hate post-holing through snow.)   The non-waterproof version of the Karakorums was specifically selected to keep my feet cooler and dry out faster. This has proven to be true. I can also apply additional water repellant coatings to the Karakorums as necessary.   The boots have sticky soles for rock climbing and have held up well so far. They also have nifty lace clamp or lock at the eyelet loops. It took a bit of play to figure out how to lock and unlock them without using my fingernails.   For fair weather trail hiking~ I use a lighter shoe and save the Karakorums for when I have to put on my ""man face.""   I picked these up at REI after fitting and evaluating a number of other mountaineering boots at several retailers. I'm not quite ready to go for the tricked-out~ stitched-up~ plastic constructions.   Eugene"
87,la-sportiva,karakorum,2.5,   I purchased these boots for use hiking and backpacking in Colorado~ on and off trail. I tend to hike 5-15 miles per day and usually carry a 20 Lb pack dayhiking and 50+Lbs backpacking. I have a narrow foot and have had good luck with the fit of LaSportiva boots in the past.   I like a stiff leather boot with lots of ankle support and the Karakorum fit the bill. I tried them on and they fit my foot very well right out of the box. They did not require much break-in time and are very comfortable. I did add a pair of Superfeet insoles.   I wore these boots on 20 to 30 hikes over a period of 2 months~ mostly on-trail in dry~ rocky terrain with distances ranging from 5-15 miles. Other than some occasional numbness of my toes from pressure on the top of my feet~ the boots felt great and I never got a blister or hot spot. The numbness was always corrected by adjusting the laces.   They seemed to be fairly waterproof. I spent one entire day slogging through deep mud on a particularly sloppy trail and my feet stayed dry. The leather stayed looking new after many days of traveling over rocky trail and a few days spent scrambling through talus and scree.   My only complaint with the boots is the build quality. Within the first few weeks of use~ the rubber scree protector began to detach from the leather on both boots. By the end of the second month~ the sole began to come unglued from the heel area of one boot.   I would expect good quality~ expensive hiking boot to stay together longer and I assume that the build quality is to blame. I have used other LaSportiva~ Asolo~ Lowa~ and Kayland boots in similar and more adverse conditions that lasted many seasons. Either the Karakorums are defective~ or they simply won't last a season of use.   Overall~ I was very happy with the fit~ but disappointed with the quality. I did not feel I used these boots heavily enough or in conditions harsh enough to cause the issues I had.
88,la-sportiva,karakorum,5.0,   A year or two ago I bought some La Sportiva Onix GTX hiking boots. They fit great and were very comfortable. Unfortunately~ they recently developed tears in the uppers. There was one tear on each boot~ both in the same location. I am normally very easy on my gear~ and have never torn uppers before.   I called La Sportiva and spoke with someone regarding their warranty policy. They said the warranty is good for one year. I explained how they tore~ and that I didn’t really think they should have. They asked me to email them photos~ which I did.   I then got a call from La Sportiva. They said the boots should not have torn and they would issue me full retail credit for the boots. I would then be able to put that credit toward any boot in the La Sportiva line. YES! That is awesome! I was super excited they would honor a boot out of their formal warranty period based on HOW it was defective.   A bit later I went to the REI Flagship store in Denver~ as they have the largest selection of La Sportiva boots around. Now~ it’s important to understand I have a tough time finding boots that fit me well. So I tried on every La Sportiva boot they carried.   Two of them fit me well~ but one of them had a thin upper material right where my Onix boots tore. Therefore~ I was hesitant to go with that model. Additionally~ they didn’t offer much lateral protection from rocks~ etc. So I had basically narrowed it down to one boot- the Karakoram.   The credit for the torn Onix boots was $145. The Karakorams were $270. Spending $270 on boots is a tough pill for me to swallow~ but if they were the only ones that would work~ well….that’s was I was going to get. After all~ I didn’t want the $145 credit to go to waste.   I called La Sportiva and told them which boot that I wanted~ but that I didn’t want to get them for another month or two~ as we have some expenses coming up that I am saving for. I asked if it would be alright if I call him in a couple months~ pay the difference and have them ship the Karakorams to me. They hesitated briefly and said~ “You know what? Don’t worry about it. We’ll cover it.”   WHAT? You’re going to send me the boots and I don’t have to pay the difference? EXCELLENT! They said the boots would be sent out today or tomorrow. Wow! Talk about top-shelf service. This is a company that I will continue to do business with for a long~ long time. Now I can keep my plans to go on a big hike in three weeks with a buddy.
89,la-sportiva,karakorum,4.5,   I purchased this boot at REI after trying several La Sportiva models via Zappos--ran out of credit card!  (I've had a pair of Makalus for 11 years but my foot is now too big for them.) Not all La Sportivas fit alike!! At least with my feet.... :-)    I wore the Karakorams for about five days prior to my trip for maybe a total of 5 hours~ street walking only. Headed out to the Hoover wilderness/Toiyabe NP on Sep 18 with a 40+ pound pack. 5.5 miles to camp and 2400 ft elevation gain--Horse creek trail. Lots of rock and some very steep loose rock. The boots kept me sure footed at all times! I had to loosen my right boot once as my feet began to swell about 2.5 hrs in.  After establishing camp I was astounded to find NO blisters!!!
90,la-sportiva,karakorum,5.0,   I have used my boots on Rainier in snow fields with crampons~ lenghthy approach hikes~ and numerous fourteeners in Colorado including Maroon Bells~ Pyramid Peak~ Shavano~ and Capitol. They were sturdy~comfortable~ and break in was not long at all. La Sportiva makes an excellent boot.
91,salewa,rapace-gtx,4.0,"   A good all-rounder.   Pros   Cons   I've used this pair for 2~5 years extensively in the Cretan mountains on mixed rocky terrain and also in snow ascents. Salewa describes this boot for mountaineering use and for via ferrata and is crampon compatible which is kinda odd because even though it has a heel welt for use with semi-automatic crampons the boot is not insulated so my feet freeze even with a good pair of winter Primaloft socks! And I'm not a guy who gets cold easily...   The color is ""Night Black Kamille"" and the weight is at around 660gr per boot (size 43EU) so pretty lightweight for a leather boot. My city-shoe size is 42EU and this pair is 43EU~ so I'd say that it is almost true to size.   The upper consists of 1.8 mm nubuck leather with Gore-Tex membrane which is more breathable than my Zamberlan 1009 Vioz Top GT RR and full rubber rant for added protection.   You also get 2-stage; lacing system (like some climbing shoes) for a more custom fit.   MFF+ (multi-feet footbed) for a better fit depending on your foot anatomy.   3F System for improved ankle support which is just coated steel wire that runs from the ankle to the lacing and from there the heel to improve rigidity without adding weight. Now I don't know if this is all marketing or if it really works but judging from the weight and performance I get in rocky terrain I'm sold.         The semi-stiff midsole consists of nylon and 27% fiberglass (according to Salewa).   The glue between the rubber rand and he leather holds well. A known weak spot in many boots I've seen.          Vibram WTC sole provide excellent traction in wet+dry rocky terrain and was also very good on firm snow but it wore off pretty quick in my opinion. Then again bare rocky terrain does that easily.      One last thing: No breaking-in required.   Experience   Overall I would suggest this boot as a good all-rounder and would definitely recommend it for 3-4 season use~ but I wouldn't recommend it for temperatures bellow -5° Celsius except if you have a pair of very warm socks.      A favorite among many fellow hikers here in Crete."
92,salewa,rapace-gtx,4.5,   Great all-around lightweight boots for scrambly terrain. Great for summer outings.    Pros   Cons   I love these boots. I've used mine intensely for the last three years and they are still good as gold. They are extremely comfortable and very lightweight. They fit my feet (I've got wide and flat feet) perfectly and don't even notice them on my foot due to their light weight.   They are my preferred pair for summer outings in rocky terrain and scrambly adventures. The edges are perfect for scrambling and the soles are very grippy~ which makes it a perfect pair of boots for hiking more technical routes out there. My pair is also fairly waterproof still. I use beeswax to keep them waterproofed.   The boot comes with a crampon fitting on the heel~ which I have used with my Petzel Sarkens a couple of times. It was a good that it had that at the time~ as I could use them with the crampons I own~ but I wouldn't want to walk all day with more technical crampons on these~ as just after a couple of hours they started giving me hot spots.   So it's good to have the option~ but I'd recommend just using G10s with these~ or more flexi crampons that don't rely on the heel hook if you are planning to be using crampons for hours on end. They are stiff enough for hiking in rocky ground and for the use of edges~ but too soft for ice climbing or front pointing for too long. Definitely not designed for that~ but you could get away with easier climbing.    I am impressed at how long the sole has lasted me~ taking into account I do hike in rocky terrain lots with them. And the leather is still great~ as well as shoelaces~ etc...   They are not the warmest~ but incredibly enough I used these in rocky terrain in Antarctica on warmer days (-1°0 to -15°) and they kept my feet warm enough. I did have warm socks and they were dry~ so it would be a different story for snowy conditions.    I would highly recommend these boots for anyone looking for a pair of light summer weight boots though.    Experience   Have had for three years   Intensive use   Used in Antarctica in summer
93,salewa,rapace-gtx,5.0,   Lightweight~ good fit~ should be a sturdy backpacking boot that also climbs well.   Pros   Cons   I just purchased these and have yet to put them through a full season. I was seeking a backpacking boot with a firm but not rigid sole that will walk and handle long approaches well~ and that will also take crampons and climb and handle off trail work well.   I expect these to be a lighter and more comfortable alternative to a pair of old leather Garmonts that had fit the bill for many years~ but that needed to be retired. This general boot style (lacing to the toe~ rand~ etc)~ Salewa uses on a number of their boots this spring. Maybe~ if these fit~ it's likely the other styles (e.g.~ hikers) based on the same platform may too...?   These fit my foot... I tend to need at least a medium width boot~ with a snug heel and roomy toebox. In these the footbed and insert option plus flexibility in lacing (from toe to top) allows lots of adjustability. I prefer to replace factory footbed inserts with Superfeet for the best the arch and heel support.   So far so good on fit. The footbed construction is firm but not rigid~ and the vibram sole provides very good traction.   I will update this report after putting in some mileage and elevation.
94,asolo,afs-8000,5.0,   2 veces por el Aconcagua~ quien los conoce Utiliza la diferencia ....   comodos~ seguros te hacen caminar pensando en el paisaje y no en los pies ...
95,asolo,afs-8000,4.0,   I used Asolo 8000s to climb high on Aconcagua Mt. in 2011. They worked fine~ good traction~ fit me just about right~ worked great with Sabretooth crampons. Most important~ they kept my feet warm in -20° C.   Fit is paramount...some folks cannot receive the proper fit with these boots. Shop for a reputable brand that does.   I purchased them brand new in 2010.   Beware of renting plastic boots! I heard of one guy who rented Asolo 8000s in Mendosa~ Argentina~ and lost toes because the boots did not protect him from the cold. Plastic boots~ because of the hardness~ do not show much in the way of wear. What happens is that the insulation within the boot gradually gets compressed and loses its insulation properties! You might rent that same pair or a similar pair at a rental shop.   Overall~ if they fit you~ and you require a plastic boot they'll do the job for you~ though I always bring my trusty Hotronics boot heaters just in case.
96,asolo,afs-8000,4.0,   This a great pair of boots if the fit is right. Spent a week on Mt. Washington in February. All day in the boots with a liner and Smartwool Mtn socks. No cold feet. No hot spots. The liner was supple~ molded to foot and kept me warm. Temps were in the single digits and as usual windy. If they fit I would highly recommend them.
97,la-sportiva,baruntse,5.0,   I love these boots !! I've had a pair of La Sportiva Evo's for a while and really liked the way they fit.   So I retired my Koflachs and sprung for the Baruntses.        Now~ the first thing everyone asks is why I didn't just get the top of the line Spantiks form La Sportiva. The well dressed mountaineer is wearing the Spantik for 2010 from what I can see.  I tried on the Spantiks and they fit great  - - BUT - - I wasn't sold on the high tech lacing system~ and had read some reviews about broken eyelets.        Turns out the Baruntse from what I can see is technically about the same insulation construction as the Spantik~ but with a traditional lacing system.        My feet are on the wide side (EE) plus my left foot is one size larger than my right~ so the game for me is to find a boot that I can dial in the fit with lacing~ liner molding and some shims. The Baruntse worked out great for that.         The liners are very good and use the Spantik style lacing system - - a zig-zag laceup that finishes with a Velcro tie down tab that sticks to the top of the boot. Here the new high tech laceup is really useful - - it's very fast to lace them up and they snug down very well. You can lace them quickly with a gloved hand~ then step into the boot. The heat molding works very well - - I did it myself using my oven at home according to the enclosed directions.         I've had them out in the field since September when I wore them for a summit of Mt. Rainier. Since then I've been out on a number of winter hikes and used them so far for one ice climbing session.       For hiking and general mountaineering they are very good - - easy to walk with on non-snow surfaces because the sole is a little narrower than my old Koflach Arctis Expes and because it has a nice rocker built into it (that doesn't go so far as to bend my crampons). I've been very warm in them to the extent I had to modify my sock layering and go to a lighter sock weight to avoid getting sweated~ even for very cold weather. I've used them down to minus 10 and they were fine!!      For ice climbing I'd rate them as good. I'm comparing this to my Evos which I've been used to for some time and are of course outstanding for ice~ which is principally what the Evo's are designed for. On climbs and expeditions~ the Baruntse will do very well for steep ice and mixed sections and are really a perfect choice for multi-day trips that the Evo's don't travel well on.       As usual~ when I was shopping for these I had to do the familiar epoch around trying on multiple sizes.   I'd 'recommend not relying on your current boots to predict sizing on the Baruntses. Instead~ I suggest trying on two sizes higher and two sizes lower than your current plastic or hybrid boot size~ and try to predict any additional fit advantage you would get from heat molding the liner. This is especially difficult these days with all but the most mountaineering specific retailers selling mail order only.        If you are in that situation~ I'd recommend ordering three sizes at once - - one size up and one size down from your current boot size. Throw it on the credit card and try them on as soon as you get them and pick the best fit. My recommendation for this approach is order from REI or EMS for store pick up~ so there's no shipping charge~ go to the store and try on the boots there~ and immediately return the two that don't fit. With the standard shipping speed for these types of orders~ it should basically cost nothing to order these multiple sets.       So to summarize:      1. Great boots   2. Watch for the pre-season or end of season sales if you can afford to wait   3. Get the sizing ABSOLUTELY right - - you'll have these boots for 20 years or more !      -g   
98,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   This is the greatest overall boot I've found in 30 years of climbing. It is amazingly light and comfortable (no blisters out of the box) yet it provides all the stability you can ask on scree~ rocks or with a hinged crampon. I don't front-point~ so I don't know about its ability there~ but it has been just great for medium-angle glacier travel.   I was looking for an alternative to the heavy~ uncomfortable plastic boots with totally rigid sole. With the Trango's three-quarter shank~ I couldn't be happier about the way it feels walking in on approach. Absolutely like a running shoe~ but still with really good support. Do yourself a favor and try a pair!
99,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,4.5,   This is a great summer mountaineering boot for general mountaineering and glacier travel.   Pros   Cons   This is a great summer mountaineering boot as it is not insulated and is very waterproof. It is incredibly lightweight and sturdy~ although the sole wears down quickly on rock.   They work well with semi-automatic crampons~ but do not have a toe welt for fully automatic crampons. They have a 3/4 length shank and rockered sole which allows them to hike very well. The laces are smooth and easy to use~ especially with the lacelock feature.   Fit: Many people say that La Sportiva footwear runs narrow. I also find that to be true.   Durability: Low weight does come at a cost. The soles are a special Vibram sole that is lightweight~ but less durable than other Vibram soles. After you wear through it~ you can get it resoled with a heavier rubber sole that will last longer.   Traction: It grips well on rock~ although the rubber is not as sticky as some soles on other boots. Kicking steps in snow in this boot is a dream. If you are going straight up or sidehilling a snow slope~ the edge holds very well due to the rigidity of the sole.   Warmth: This boot is not insulated and my feet were warm above 20°F while moving~ wearing medium weight wool socks.   I have used this boot for 20 days of glacier and snow travel and have yet to be disappointed. If you're looking for a lightweight summer mountaineering boot that is totally waterproof and you have slightly narrow feet~ look no further!
100,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,2.5,"   This is a very light boot. Feels more like a climbing shoe--BUT NOT AN ICE CLIMBING BOOT. Mtn Hardware claims it has ""frointpointing stability."" It does not. It flexes at the ball like a pair of heavy sneakers and I can't imagine what kind of crampons could front point up anything but low angle spring snow in these boots. Maybe footfangs~ but there is no toe bail rand.    This is not what I call an alpine boot--it is not suitable for crampons.    I sent them back; maybe OK for someone else~ but I wanted a crampon platform. This is my first synthetic boot. I was snowed by the light weight. I suspect that you can't find a stable crampon platform under 4lbs.   If anyone knows otherwise~ please let me know.  I have nice leather ALPINE boots with a rocker sole and rigid enough for crampons~ but they weight 5 1/2 lbs. I have plastic double boots. I was looking for something for mixed climbing in the Tetons etc. This ain't it."
101,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   Used these boots twice - once for climbing Huayna Potosi in Bolivia~ and then for the Annapurna Circuit. Too cold for Huayna - had to turn around at around 5700 meters as I couldn't feel my toes. They were superb for the Annapurna trek - comfortable~ lightweight for a climbing boot (a bit of overkill for the trek perhaps) and never anything even close to a blister. Great boots - trim~ not at all clunky. Plan to use them a lot more this spring and summer~ but only below 5500 meters.
102,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,4.5,   Great boots.   Pros   Cons   Great traction when rock climbing~ considering they are boots. Had them last summer in Chamonix~ France. I had the Trangos for trekking and glacier crossing with crampons. When wet the Trangos did perform well~ very little chaffing.
103,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,3.5,   I have used these boots on numerous climbs to Mt Blanc~ mixed ice/snow mostly with crampons. Overall~ they are very sturdy~ though I still get blisters on both heels on long hikes. They are light and perfect for dry conditions where you need good stability with the added flexibility of strapping on a pair of crampons.   HOWEVER~ Not well insulated. My feet froze badly on any assent above 4500m. I'm stuck with them for now~ but will upgrade to a better isolated model once these wear through.
104,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,3.0,   This boot came highly recommended~ but after 4 to 6 decent hikes I'm still getting heel blisters.  Either they take forever to break in~ or there's something else wrong...they may be too stiff for the light hiking I've done so far~ or they're flawed.   I'm sure the size is right~ and I've tried different single and double dry sock configurations.  I'm not sure what else to do~ but I'm dreading some longer multi-day backpack/climbs coming up if I can't get the heel blisters to stop.  Otherwise a great boot...super light~ narrow.
105,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   After climbing for 35 years I have finally found the perfect boot. Great fit out of the box. This boot is comfortable for any kind for climbing including long approaches. I have never had a problem with cold feet and have used these boots at -20 ice climbing with no problem.   I just returned from a fairly challenging glacier ascent and was so impressed with the preformance of these boots again that I had to write this review. So far I have put in 10 Pacific Northwest ascents all on glaciers some with vertical ice and have had no blisters or foot issues at all with my Trangos.
106,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   I must say that after being a mountaineer for 30+ years it is nice to see they can still teach an old dog new tricks! This goes for boots as well.   At the ripe old age of 56 my body~ including feet~ just does not take the abuse like it once did. These boots are the most comfortable out of the box I have ever slid onto my feet!   First trip was into Goat Rocks in Washington state on a 3 day solo. Not a hot spot or any other issues.   If this boot fits your feet give it a shot Light and comfortable all rolled into one.
107,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   I bought these boots to get into more winter hiking and climbing. These boots were completely comfortable for everything from late fall through spring climbing and hiking. I even managed to spend a very comfortable climb on ice when the air temperature was over 60.    I've used them on steep ascents in crampons or hiking in snowshoes without any problem and with the fact that they are so light~ it makes a world of difference when having to move quick when the weather turned south. The boots aren't completely rigid~ so crampons that can deal with a little flex is not a bad thing.     Needless to say~ I'm very happy with these boots...
108,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   I bought this boot to supplement my old school heavy leather hiking boots~ and after a couple of uses I only wear these! I was used to prepping my feet for blisters from the old boots~ but that isn't a concern here.  Even out of the box~ these boots fit like tennis shoes yet are supportive and rugged. They were totally comfortable on days of 8-10 hours nonstop hiking. I even did a little bouldering~ and even slipped once crossing a river but thanks to their support~ didn't twist anything. Carrying a medium weight pack my feet were fine!     I've read other reviews and can't understand the blisters others have received. I use a silk liner sock and a heavy wool boot sock... and now gone are the days of moleskin and molefoam on my heels! I'm a convert to this style of boot. I do wonder about the use of leather lace loops vs metal~ but so far haven't had any trouble. They've been warm enough in mild snow (~4 inches) and I'm anxious to see how they work during the upcoming summer). So far I think they're great!
109,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,2.0,"   I bought these boots for a mountain climbing trip (Rainier). After three months of ""breaking in~"" I'm still getting blisters on my heels. Now one lace eyelet has ripped out.    I called Sportiva and of course they offered to repair it under warranty. What happens if another eyelet blows out on the mountain or in the middle of a multi-day trip? Well~ they'll waranty that too. A lot of good that will do me on a glacier on Rainier.     I don't really want these boots anymore (three months of break-in and still painful)~ so I asked if I could return them even for a partial credit towards a different model (I'd take the Storm~ which cost half as much - I need light day hikers anyway). They won't do that.     On the upside~ they are very lightweight~ completely waterproof~ newmatic crampon compatible~ and the virbam rubber on the soles provides excellent traction - even with a heavy pack~ I never had to worry about losing traction climbing rocks and boulders.   In summary~ although this boot has some good features~ it's painful~ not sturdy enough~ and for the $$ Sportiva charges they should be more responsive to dissatisfied customers."
110,la-sportiva,trango-s-evo-gtx,5.0,   Great boots... I've always been loving leather~ but if you think of an incredibly lightweight product with a perfect construction highly engineered... this is the Trango Trek.   Great for approaching~ fit as a gaunt...and last but not least: not made in China!   bye!
111,la-sportiva,trango-cube-gtx,4.5,   Much more than your average boot~ the Trango Cube GTX Highlander boots are great on more technical trails and rock scrambles~ and perform ideally when the weather turns less than ideal.    Pros   Cons   Highlander Model Note: The Trango Cube GTX Highlanders I tested are the same as the Trango Cube GTX mountaineering boots~ but in a camo pattern aimed at hunters. I tested them primarily with that use in mind.   Conditions: Trekking along the ridges and valleys of the Allegheny and Appalachian mountains~ these boots have seen their fair share of the woods. For approximately four months~ these boots have been put to the test while hiking and hunting. Conditions have ranged from 60°F to -10°F (15.5C to -23C) and the boots have trudged through snow~ ice~ mud~ creeks~ leaf litter~ up and over limestone rocks~ shale~ and much more.   Although the boots have seen a great deal of elevation gain/loss~ this has been done in a non-technical mountaineering manner. While wearing the Trango Cube GTX Highlanders~ I have carried packs weighing up to 28 lbs. (12.7 kg) and dragged two deer out of the woods~ both weighing 95-110 lbs (43-50 kg). (Unfortunately~ these were my friends’ deer and not my own.)   Weight: US men’s 13 weighs 32.19 oz. or .913 kg each boot.      Fit and Comfort: My feet are slightly narrow~ with normal to ever-so-slightly high arches. My typical footwear size is men’s US 13~ and so for these I tested a EU 47. Some hikers go up in size for their boots~ but since half-sizes above men’s US 13 are rare~ I stick to my size. Due to a variety of testing conditions and temperatures~ I wore a variety of socks with these boots including two-layers on the colder days of hunting~ and a micro-thin merino wool sock when warmer and putting in the miles.   The fit is more snug than other boots I own~ but mostly comfortable. The toe box is adequately wide~ the heel is secure~ and the area across the laces fit fine~ particularly with the lock-out laces that allow for easy customization of lacing styles. The one area where I’ve experienced discomfort is at the tongue~ across the shin. I thought I could solve this discomfort with the removable tongue~ but that hasn’t been the case. It feels like a pressure spot~ particularly on inclines~ and I’ve even noticed some signs of rubbing~ but nothing that has caused a blister or bruise at this point.   Although a high-performing boot and perfect for some conditions~ there have been times where I couldn’t help but feel like the boots were “too much~” similar to driving a Ferrari through the neighborhood at 35 mph. In rocky terrain or steep inclines~ these boots are perfect. On a flat trail or simply still hunting~ they may be a little overkill.       Construction: The Trango Cube GTX Highlander has an interesting design and construction. Without simply regurgitating the specs here~ to me the most interesting features are the thermo-injected lock-out lacing system and the durable waterproof fabric across the boot’s uppers~ lined with GoreTex protection. The thermo-injected lacing system also wraps in strategic locations (i.e. near toe and just below ankle) for additional abrasion protection and support.          Boots~ removable tongues~ and insoles      Closer look at the removable tongue and insole            Velcro attach point for removable tongueTraction: The Vibram soles are very durable and after four months of use~ show very little sign of wear. The lugs~ known as the Impact Brake System~ do a nice job of shedding dirt~ mud~ and grime and I have not experienced any slipping or loss of traction~ even when hiking over snow-covered rock gardens and while dragging 110 pounds of deer out of the woods on a very wet morning. While I have not required crampons~ I fit on a pair of hybrid crampons with no issues.       Water Resistance and Temp Control: Having worn these boots through snow~ slush~ rain~ and even wading through some ankle-deep creeks~ I have no doubt the seamless upper and Gore-Tex membrane is up to the task of keeping water out. One downfall of almost all waterproof items is that when water is kept out~ internal moisture tends to stay in. For this reason~ breathability is crucial. My feet tend to run hot~ and I almost exclusively wear some sort of merino or blended socks with hiking and hunting boots. These boots don’t run any hotter than normal~ but I didn’t notice any considerable increased breathability or climate control either.                    Recommendation:Without a doubt~ the La Sportiva Trango Cube GTX Highlander is a well-made boot and will likely serve its purpose for many many years. Whether hunting or hiking~ these boots can withstand a lot of elements. However~ both hiking and hunting footwear requirements vary widely depending on the type of terrain. These are probably more boot than one needs for flat trails and or just walking to the tree stand. But when it comes to mountaineering~ boulder scrambling~ and slightly more technical trails~ especially in foul weather~ these are ideal boots.          Acknowledgment: Many thanks to both Trailspace and La Sportiva for the opportunity to test the Trango Cube GTX Highlander boots.
112,scarpa,zodiac-tech-gtx,4.5,"   The Scarpa Zodiac Tech is a near perfect light mountain boot. Great sticky Vibram sole and a perfect fit makes for all day comfort. I’d love to see a toe welt added and the colour possibly tweaked a little. This boot would be best for glacial travel~ light scrambling~ non-technical peaks as well as winter hiking (both with traction devices or snowshoes).   Pros   Cons      Opening Rant   I’m not sure what category these boots fit in. And I don’t say that as a negative~ as you can see from the star rating and (if reading further) an otherwise glowing review. I just don’t know what they do best~ probably because they do at lot of things really~ really well. They are clearly taking aim at the La Sportiva Trango’s strangle hold of the “somewhere in between the approach and the mountaineering boot” market~ but that is a very small niche.    You could easily get away with using them exclusively for three-season mountaineering~ and even some mild winter peaks~ but anything around -15°C or colder you are going to want more insulation~ as well as the ability to dry out a double boot.   With that said~ they are just so comfortable and so well designed that I have found I’ve been reaching for them all winter.      Fit/Comfort   Normally I find marketing lingo to be mostly hype and pay it no mind. Scarpa promotes these as made with “sock fit construction~” but they literally fit my foot as comfortably as a sock. I don’t really know how to describe my feet~ but let's start with ugly.    I have a narrow heel and a forefoot~ low arches and wider forefeet. I’ve never had any problems with heel slippage and the toe boxes roomy enough to not cause any restriction (especially important in winter boots as people often complain of cold feet due to a lack of circulation).    I usually wear a 10.5 U.S. shoe and received a size 10.5 for testing~ which fits perfectly with a pair of light merino socks. It weighs 1lb 8 oz per boots~ which is extremely lightweight and compares favourably with the 1 lb 10 oz Trango which is wildly popular~ as does the price $290 for the Scarpa and $320 for the La Sportiva.      I did what I would do with any new pair of boots to give these a fair shot—wear them around the house exclusively for a week or two. A couple hours a night will quickly alert you to any potential problem areas/hot spots/etc. Once they passed that test (with flying colours) I generally move to a couple shorter day hikes (~5 kms). I was so confident in these however that they were thrown into a couple 12-km approaches with mixed terrain right away.   I’m not sure really where to start with the number of features they’ve added to make this such a comfortable fit.   The sole of the boot is a Vibram Pentax Precision II XT that has a great combination of support and rigidity while still allowing good ground feel and the flex required for all day comfort.       On Scarpa’s website they are given a B1 rating~ not sure why as in my opinion they are firmly in the B2 category [able to be used for light winter~ good ankle support and able to use with either a new-matic~ or strap-on (C1 or C2)~ crampon]. I don’t own either (again this is another niche I find too small as I either use a full rigid for mountaineering and ice climbing~ or a fully flexible “crampon” like the Hillsound Trail Crampon~ (which I consider more of a light traction device rather than a full on crampon~ for trail use) but that's a rant for another day.   I did rent a pair from my local MEC to test the fit~ and found the Petzl Vasak that I borrowed to fit securely. These boots will not work with a step-in style crampon as there is no toe welt. This is probably my only major disappointment with this boot. It would be so easy to add~ and provides the securest binding for a crampon. The sole has a slight rocker shape to it which aids you in hiking on flatter trails.      The “Autofit Collar”—again these are all marketing terms used by Scarpa but they work so well that I just have to mention them—basically the collar they are using on this boot is extremely soft and flexible. I’ve found this does two things. One~ it doesn’t add any pressure to the back of the achilles~ and two~ it does a wonderful job of keeping any snow~ scree~ dirt~ rocks~ etc~ out of the boot even when wearing them without any gaiters.    There is also memory foam along the back of the heel that literally hugs your ankle. I’m also gonna add the one-piece tongue into this section as I feel it works in conjunction with the collar to provide solid support without any hot sports or bunching.       The lacing runs right to the toe and has a set of locking hooks at the flexing point of the ankle. It’s a pretty standard feature these days~ but works well in allowing you to individualize the tightness above~ and below~ the ankle.   The weight of these boots is 24.8 oz which undoubtedly makes them more comfortable to wear all day. I’m not someone who usually notices the weight of boots~ (*I am usually wearing a pair of Limmer lightweights even when I’m not hiking~ don’t let the name fool you) but putting these on is like wearing trail runners with more support.      Weather Resistance/Temperature Control   This winter has been an odd one here in the Northeast—many unseasonably warm days often alternating with well below freezing days. It has caused an awkward build up of ice on many of the trails~ which are often thin and covering some large puddle or pothole.    These boots are unquestionably waterproof—like ""stand in a stream~ repeated freezing/thawing"" waterproof. I put these boots through a ringer of wet environments~ many that they weren't even designed for~ only to come away impressed~ and dry. With 1.8mm of Perwanger Suede and a Gore-tex lining between you and the water you are pretty much assured of staying dry.    My feet generally run cold to begin with so I don’t often overheat in boots~ and obviously almost never overheat in winter. I’d say on this front the testing is inconclusive. The warmest days I wore these was at about 7 degrees Celsius and I didn’t feel sweaty or clammy feet.          Another thing I love about these boots is the large rubber rand that runs the entirety of the boot. It's another layer of protection~ for times like kicking in steps into hard icy slopes~ and another layer against water getting in.   Potential drawback? The top of the footbox is relatively flat which allows snow to sit on top. It hasn’t leaked~ and shows no signs of it~ but even if you knock it off routinely it piles back up quickly.          Construction and Durability   So far~ so good. I haven’t managed to damage these boots at all and given the quality of materials used (1.8mm Perwanger Suede~ Gore-Tex~ Vibram) and the thoughtful construction (rubber rand)~ I wouldn’t expect to. The metal eyelets embedded into the suede should outlast the lifetime of the boot and asymmetrical cut of the laces on the toe shows the attention to the little details. Even the rubber rand comes farthest along the big toe~ the area where conceivably would take the brunt of damage kicking in steps~ etc..      The Vibram soles show no sign of wear~ not that winter is particularly hard on boot soles. They’ve most often been covered with some form of traction device.   There is some zigzag stitching along the outstep of the boot. Not sure how much of that is out of necessity and how much of it is for show~ but they are exposed and at a prime area for abrasion. They haven’t frayed at all but they are an area I’d be interested in monitoring long term. Should they show signs they would be very easy to cover with some seam grip and they’d probably be better than new~ although uglier.      Warning: petty gripe to come….I find the colour of these a little off putting. I know~ I know~ I’m grasping at straws here trying to find some constructive criticism. It’s starting to grow on me~ but the orange is quite bright and with the addition of a little dirt has turned into an unappealing orange. Comfort beats colour though~ so they're still a winner.   Conclusion   These Scarpa Zodiac Tech boots can do a little bit of everything. Whether you're looking for a winter hiking boot~ an approach boot~ a three-season mountaineering boot~ or a boot for light glacial travel and non technical peaks~ these should be in consideration. The fit is spot on~ it's very lightweight~ and it's made with high quality materials. As with all boots~ it is best to try them on in person~ ideally by an experienced boot fitter.   Conditions   These Scarpa Zodiac Tech boots have been tested for over four months in Ontario~ Canada. Temperatures ranged from -23°C to +12°C (-9.4° f to 53.6° f) and across varying terrain—rocky ridges to pine forest floors~ sandstone to scree. At this point they have roughly 150 kms on them and show no signs of wear. They have also been worn with Petzl crampons~ Hillsound Trail crampons~ and snowshoes.       My thanks to Trailspace and Scarpa for the opportunity to test these boots."
113,scarpa,mont-blanc-pro-gtx,4.5,   Solid classic gets several small but innovative upgrades.   Pros   I found myself on a different continent with sudden opportunities to go up to the Mont Blanc and do some ice and mixed climbing. I had some gear with me but not my mountaineering boots. After visiting all the rental shops that were open and not finding a boot that fit me~ I had to bite down and buy a new pair. It hurt~ but relatively little in the feet.    Fit:   The Mont Blanc Pro GTX (upgrade from the Scarpa's classic Mont Blanc GTX) is built on the NAG last. I have very narrow feet~ and these were slightly wide for me. From what I read is that these do not fit wide (otherwise I wouldn't have bought them)~ but not overly narrow either. I have to tie them pretty tight~ but then do not get significant heel lift~ or toes jamming into the front. I do think they fit a bit wider than my normal mountaineering boots - the TNF Verto S6K's.      solid rubber rand~ one piece upper      high closure on the calf through integrated gaiter       Comfort:   I also find the inner sole/foot bed of the S6K's a bit more comfortable~ but that could have been partly due to the thinner socks I had available. The Scarpa SockFit as Scarpa calls it~ is very nice though. There are very little if any stitches or seams on the inside that you can feel. It seems as if the whole inner and outer are constructed out of one piece~ which also means there is less to tear or leak or rub and irritate. Very nice.    The tongue has these PU ribs injected in them~ which help spread the forces of tight lacing over a larger area. I found this to work quite well~ but it depends how you lace. The ribs can also buckle a little~ which although noticeable~ doesn't hurt. It wouldn't be an issue once on the mountain~ but is perhaps something to keep in mind~ try out when you are lacing them.    Support:   Support is very solid as is to be expected from a boot with a full shank. The Grivel G12 New-Matic crampons that I used fit really well~ which was especially good on the mixed climbing sections we did. It felt better and tighter than the same crampons on my TNF Verto S6K's~ which are fine but have a tiny bit of play.    Ease of Use:   The boots were very easy to put on and tighten due to the quick lace system. The integrated gaiter is nice~ two buttons shut them tight and you have two settings to choose how tight. If you are going to spend a lot of time in fresh or deep snow~ I would still use separate gaiters though~ as some snow can still get in between your boots and pants. For me ice climbing it wasn't an issue.    Even though these are full shank stiff mountaineering boots~ the Mont Blanc Pro's do pretty well on the approach. There are softer PU inserts in the mid sole that absorb some shock and overall these don't feel overly clunky. They are also quite light for what they are.    Temp Control:   These boots are meant for winter mountaineering~ mixed~ ice fall~ and somewhat alpine summer. I got cold toes ice climbing~ but I can get cold feet easily~ and I didn't have the socks that I would normally have in those conditions.    Overall:   The Mont Blanc Pro GTX's are light but very solid boot~ with some very nice new features and a construction that is built to last. I have the feeling the TNF Verto S6K's are a bit better fit on my foot~ but this is something that very much depends on each individual. The Scarpas~ with their one piece upper and fat rand and overall construction feel more solid or long lasting.   Very much recommend checking them out. 
114,scarpa,wrangell-gtx,4.5,   This is a very sturdy boot~ made with quality materials.    Pros   Cons   This is a very sturdy boot~ made with quality thick suede and metal eyelets with an adjustable lace system to hold your heal tightly in place. It runs about 1/2 to 1 full size small. Even though the sizing runs small~ they are made with correct proportions for average to wide feet. I did replace the factory insoles with Superfeet inserts to add support and comfort before I went on an outing with them~ so I am not able to tell you how they are with the factory insoles.   They are a very serious mountaineering boot made to last~ made to be waterproof~ and made to be comfortable (for me after they were broken in hiking a few short hikes and then about an 8 mile hike). Just a warning~ the sole is very stiff at first~ but then becomes a lot more flexible as time goes on. The boots' inside temperature was comfortable even though the it was in the 70s outside.   I will be using them for a hike up Mt. Whitney soon and wanted something that could use step in crampons as it may have snow nearing the ten thousand foot and up elevation. The support and traction are excellent~ my foot feels anchored with every step taken.
115,la-sportiva,nepal-cube-gtx,5.0,"   My definite winter boot. Couldn't be happier!   Pros   Cons   I needed some stiff boot for winter mountaineering and as per multiple friends' recommendations I was going to buy the trusted Nepal Evo. That was until I started digging a little more into the Nepal series...   Enter the Cube!   I admit~ it was a gamble because there where very few reviews and no references from any fellow hiker. Cube's main selling point compared to the Evo is the carbon honeycomb insole that ups the price +160€ but adds extra warmth and reduces the weight -150gr. per boot.   UPPER: 3.2mm silicone impregnated Idro-Perwanger Roughout Leather with high-abrasion resistant fabric / Air-injected rubber randsLINING: Gore-Tex Insulated Comfort FootwearINSOLE: 3mm Carbon Tech honeycomb insulation / 4mm EVAMIDSOLE: 3 mm Polyurethane graded for crampon attachmentSOLE: Vibram Matterhorn with Impact Brake SystemLots of padding in the upper part to facilitate a more natural movement compared to the Frankenstein-like that other stiff boots are notorious about.   I walked 2km on tarmac in order to reach my car with almost the same speed and fluidity as some of my friends that were wearing semi-stiff boots and had no hot spots or issues whatsoever. Brilliant!Fit: My street shoe size is 42EU. A friend who is the same shoe size bought 43EU for the Evo and suggested I do the same~ but a reviewer (and La Sportiva's site) suggested that the boot is true to size and there is no need to upsize. Obviously it is accounted that due to winter use a thick or double sock is going to be used. I wonder if I could have gotten away with 42EU...Just to play it safe I upsized 1/2.   I wore them with a medium weight merino and with my Mund Makalu socks and the fit was great in either case due to the two-zone lacing system that manages to create two different lacing tensions. I usually prefer to keep the foot area somehow loose (I curl my toes for wiggle room and then tighten) and I tighten the rest of it from the ankle up except when traversing at steep angle for a long period of time that I tighten uniformly. Notice the closed ring. In order to ""lock"" it down all you have to do is to pull the laces inwards. That's it! By the way~ the yellow stitching area with the red arrows is the flex zone.   And in order to ""unlock"" just pull the laces outwards and you're done.   I still haven't used the extra tongue that is included and supposedly increases ventilation because its primary use (I think) is with a lighter weight sock or if you still experience heel lift~ which I didn't.    My feet are not bone-dry but they're not soggy either~ plus this boot is designed for lower temperatures than the ones I experienced this winter in Crete. Still haven't used the additional tongue to have a more definite opinion although...There was no break-in period and the fit is amazing to the point that they felt more secure and comfortable than my Salewa Rapace (at least when ascending/descending) in firm snow with my crampons on.   When I scrambled a few time the edging in dry rock was awesome. I did not feel as fatigued as I expected. Tons of support!   Apart from one time that I developed a blister in my inner ankle due to traversing with looser lace settings than I should~ I had no mechanical issues whatsoever.      I have used them in loose and firm snow~ with and without crampons from 24/12/2019 to this date so I cannot comment about their durability~ but their performance is consistent and I'm very excited about it.   I also received numerous compliments about the Cube's good looks which is nice :)   Forgot mentioning the weight in size 42.5. I'll let you be the judge...   Portable scaleKitchen scaleP.S This is the 2019 version. Not sure if there's any difference between this and older versions."
116,la-sportiva,nepal-cube-gtx,2.5,   At the recommendation of the outfitter near Mt. Rainier I purchased these boots with a 90-day window to break them in. Supposedly 70 percent of the guides out there wear these. With three weeks before my climb and thousands invested to summit Rainier these boots hurt like hell.    I have tried Superfeet inserts of five types~ several configurations of thick and thin socks~ with and without liner socks~ laced up tight to hold my heel down—they rub and hurt every time I take a walk. It is a mile around my block and I have put about 20 miles on these Nepal Cubes.    Now I am beginning to feel desperate and have invested several thousand planning this special trip. These may soon be for sale as I try to find an old used pair that offer more comfort.   Maybe it's just my feet~ but I wear Salomon boots every day in comfort. Tonight I filled them with water and tried to get them to form to my feet with slight improvement. Certainly do not look forward to hiking for 20 hours in these with or without crampons.
117,la-sportiva,trango-extreme-evo-light-gtx,0.5,   The first season was great~ although lifting heel. The second one fully wet. Are these boots meant to last one season only?      
118,la-sportiva,trango-extreme-evo-light-gtx,4.5,   Excellent boots~ light and strong for anyone!   Pros   Cons   Hi Pals!   These are one of the best and light mountain climbing shoes~ perfect movement on rock or even deep powder snow only with Millet Alpine Gaiters.   You can just easy jump from slope to slope downhill with or without 12-14 toe crampons.   In very cold when temperature is below minus 14°Celsius you must wear foot warmers!
119,la-sportiva,trango-extreme-evo-light-gtx,5.0,   Perfect for mixed climbing as being light and perfect fit. Warm and completely waterproof.   Pros   Cons   As described in their website~ it was perfect regular fit with a little room. So~ I did NOT customize lacing. It is so comfortable that I could use it out of box to the trail.   The firm sole did support my steps over mixed cliff in Mt. Whitney. At the same~ I could feel all changes in terrain at the front of my toes. I don't have any issue in deep snow with gaiters over them. I am sure it will last forever like it is now.
120,la-sportiva,trango-extreme-evo-light-gtx,4.5,"   I got these boots 8 months ago. I was looking for boots suitable for crampons~ that were light~ comfortable and warm suitable for every below 5000m in summer without neopreen boot covers (such as ""40 below"").   Meanwhile I have used them for a winter camping~ pulka trip (temperature varying from -20°C to 0°C)~ with the bootcovers. Without the covers the boots are not warm enough. Since we stored them inside the tent during the night they were frozen~ so it took some warming up time~ As soon as you are walking they were toasty.    There was no time for walking in~ but they felt like slippers and VERY light.   For the more technical scrambling they work perfect~ very precise~ stiff enough and with a lot of flexibility due to the flexible ankle shaft without loosing the good support for your feet.   I have only used them in cold condition but even then there was no sweat build up~ not even after 2 weeks (and no chance to dry properly during the night). I expect them to dry very quick since only synthetic materials are used.   Overall a very good (stiff) boots~ just don't expect them to perform as runners on a well maintained trail. "
121,lowa,weisshorn-gtx,5.0,"   Excellent overall boot~ especially for technical alpine work. Surprisingly comfortable fit.   Pros   Cons   I've always had to use a stiff boot due to injuring both ankles in a bad skiing tumble ages ago. After using my Kastinger Denali boot for close to 35 years (and going through three sets of soles)~ I decided to move up into something new. I chose Lowa as their boots usually fit my feet the best of all brands. I originally wanted the Silberhorn~ but I waited too long~ and they were sold out.   First Impressions   I had a bit of sticker shock originally — $440 for Silberhorns~ and $460 for the Weisshorns. However~ once I considered that I paid $200 for the Denalis 35 years ago~ I guess these prices are not out of line.   When I opened the box~ the first thing I noticed was the bright glare of the Lime Green color. I've already had more than my share of Shrek and Kermit jokes~ and a while back a teen-aged girl asked if I would give her the boots because she though they were ""so cool looking"".   I am in the process of trying to transform the color toward a more reasonable brown (good old Kiwi polish)~ but the excellent waterproofing of the Weisshorn is making this a long term project.   When I put the boot on the first time~ I had to double check that I received the correct boots. These boots are LIGHT for a stiff mountaineering boot. Compared to the Asolo TPS 520 boots I had~ these are only about half a pound more per pair.   Not only are they light~ the rocker and very slight forward flex make these boot a pleasure to walk in — gone is the Frankenstein clomp.   Fit   Originally I couldn't understand why I had great discomfort in the fit on the top part of my foot~ especially as I got these a size larger than I normally wear. No matter how I adjusted the lacing~ the boot acted like a low volume boot -- rather unusual for Lowa boots. I actually was just about to send them back when I found out the tongues are adjustable due to being installed via velcro rather than being sewn in. After experimenting  with different tongue placements~ I found the ideal arrangement. Now these have nearly a ""glove"" fit   The next item to finding the best fit is learning to use the unique lacing lock Lowa has on these boots. There are a pair of triangular-shaped cam locks midway up the lacing. Making sure the cam locks are open (aimed outward)~ the lower lacing can be adjusted for best foot comfort (I use a surgeon's knot within this section to help fine tune this lacing). Then close the cam locks into their locked position (turned inward~ the natural position when getting ready to continue lacing the boot).   The cams work like a set of Jumars~ preventing the lace from being pulled through the cams. With the cams locked~ the ankle part of the lacing can be made very tight to lock the heel without affecting the lower lacing.  Three sets of hooks help finish the lacing.   There is one VERY SERIOUS CAVEAT on lacing these boots. The laces go through a pair of loops right after the cam locks (this is the part of the lacing that locks the heel). The outside loop of each boot has a protective leather cover to keep the loop and lacing from being damaged by contact with rocks when climbing. It is possible to pass the lace between the leather cover and the actual loop — I did this accidentally on both boots.    The leather covering is sewn to the loop~ and this sewing will actually hold the lace for quite a while before suddenly letting loose. So double check that the lace is actually through the loop when reinstalling the laces~ not between the leather and the actual loop.   The boot is fairly tall for a mountaineering boot. However~ the neoprene cuff~ combined with the synthetic material and thick tongue~ prevent any pressure on the shins or back of the leg.   Usage   The factory waterproofing of these boots is extremely good. When I first tried to augment this with Sno Seal~ the factory waterproofing allowed very little Sno Seal to be absorbed. Only until I used the boot quit a bit and got them scuffed~ Sno Seal was not really needed at all.   Even though these boot are very light~ the Thinsulate insulation makes them very warm. So far I've had them out to -10 without and cold spots. Hopefully this coming winter I'll be able to see what they do at lower temperatures. Surprisingly~ these boots do not overheat my feet during summer hiking -- they seem to keep my feet comfortable at all temperatures.   Performance   I was concerned the forward flex would compromise actual climbing. However~ this flex is limited~ and standing on the toe is quite secure. I could not get any lateral flexing on edging~ and the ankle is just flexible enough for comfortable ""flat-footing"". The synthetic materials in the ankle portion of the boot make them pleasing flexible for walking~ but still plenty stiff for front-pointing.    Once you get the tongue and lacing figured out~ the heel is completely locked in its pocket~ allowing complete control of the boot.  This also prevents blisters. There is sufficient ""wiggle"" room for my toes to prevent pinching~ and the arch support is superb.   The sole is cut narrow~ so there is no overhang past the boot edge. This makes edging extremely stable and confident.  The boot takes my Sabertooth crampons without a hitch -- in fact~ all side points are perfectly aligned with the sole edges~ making mixed climbing much easier (I always know where both the inner and outer crampon points are).   The tread pattern is not the traditional Vibram ""waffle-stomper""~ but has more tapered edges on the lugs that don't collect rocks and mud as readily as the ""standard"" pattern. As with all hard sole compounds~ be careful on slippery wet rocks.   Recommendations   The Weisshorn is not a good fit for someone who just wants a heavy duty backpacking boot. I thing the Lowa Mountain Expert or Cevedale would be a better choice in that event.  But if someone is looking for a very good overall alpine boot~ this is definitely the boot to get."
122,lowa,weisshorn-gtx,4.0,   Versatile mountaineering boot with good performance that won't break the bank. Good for general mountaineering.   Pros   Cons   This boot does a lot of things well. It's flexible enough to wear on medium to long approaches without killing your feet~ yet it's stiff enough to use while front pointing on water ice.   I chose Lowa because I have a wide foot with a high instep and I knew that I could get the fit I was looking for because of being a previous Lowa owner. The slanted top cuff allows the foot and leg to flex at a downward angle while climbing on glaciers and steep snow while keeping the crampon points in the ground pied a' plat style.   The lace system is very smooth thanks to ball bearings that allow the laces to glide effortlessly. It does make a difference. There are lace locks that allow you to adjust the fit to your liking and it holds well without slipping.  The tongue is adjustable and has a piece of Velcro that allows you to move it up or down. This made a huge difference on fit. With my high instep I adjusted the tongue upwards and it gave me a lot more room in the instep area.   I've used these boots on several mountaineering trips now and they seem to be holding up well. They are warm enough for me to use on 14~000 ft mountains in all four seasons and are waterproof. The Vibram Dolent sole seems to have good grip on rock~ snow and ice. The boots are very well constructed and I haven't had any wear issues (and I'm really tough on boots).    I have a set of Petzl Lynx automatic crampons and they fit this boot without any issues. On another page one reviewer had issues with premature wear on the soles~ but I haven't experienced this. The boot is a bit heavy and there are lighter options out there~ however if you're tough on boots you may want to stick with leather construction like on the Lowa or other boots. 
123,lowa,weisshorn-gtx,1.0,"   These boots got sent back to Lowa. Total 180 on this review.   Pros   Cons   This review started out with a positive regard to these boots~ although there have been a particular set of circumstances that have left a bad taste in my mouth for these boots.   I hiked and climbed in these boots for half a season with no major issues and they appeared to perform quite well~ although I did begin to notice a pressure spot on the lateral aspect of my 5th metatarsal which became progressively worse with each climb I did (ice~ alpine~ and hiking). By the end of this season (2015)~ I had 8/10 pain in my foot after just 1 hour of climbing.   To make matters worse~ I discovered that the heel welt on the left boot had a 1.5"" crack running horizontally where the welt meets the heel. The pressure spot I can attest to poor fit which I understand happens with fitting these types of boot. I have a fairly wide forefoot which the new Lowa boots (Weisshorns and Latok) do not seem to fit well with my foot. The crack is a structural defect and I returned these boots to Lowa and will not be donning a second pair come next season.   On a side note~ the boots I wore prior to these were the Lowa Mtn Expert GTX which I loved and beat the snot out of with no issues."
124,scarpa,charmoz,3.5,   Modern~ attractive~ affordable~ and durable. However they are so stiff and high I never felt sure-footed wearing them in dangerous steep country.   Pros   Cons   I bought a pair of these to replace my Meindl Makalu Pros~ which were great boots that I managed to wear out pretty quickly.   Straight off the bat I was impressed with the light weight of the Scarpas. Experienced hikers will know that the lighter the boots you have~ the more energy you will have at the end of the day.   I'm always worried about blisters~ but these boots came with me to the NZ Southern Alps with virtually no wearing in.   They are a little bit disconcerting to wear as the sole is so high it almost felt that I was wearing some kind of platform boot. It is also very stiff and unyielding and as a consequence I did not feel very confident clambering around very slippery wet and icy country with big falls a distinct possibility if you lose your footing.   This may have been because I have not been in the mountains for quite some time so was out of practice~ but they definitely did not give me the sure footed confidence that my Meindl boots did.   However the Scarpas were totally waterproof and I hardly got my feet wet when crossing icy cold mountain streams. They were also pretty comfortable with no toe pinch~ though they look quite pointy at the front. Insulation was also good and my feet were never cold at any time.   Despite being largely synthetic they came though a grueling five-day trip only looking slightly worn with no damage at all.   Still in the back of my mind I'm concerned about how I just did not feel sure footed in them.      I'm going back to NZ on another alpine mountain trip in January 2018 so will give them another run. Perhaps I will have more feedback after that trip.   * Update 23rd Jan 2018:   I used the boots again on another hunting trip to the Southern Alps. This time I felt more confident wearing them. For running down Shingle Slides and moderate to steep rolling country they were great. Once again on the really steep dangerous bits I found them lacking in tactile feel. Mind you~ I went into places where I really should have been roped up but wasn't.   I did get some toe pinch going downhill and almost started developing a blister at one point but this was more a bad choice of socks than any fault of the boots.   Once again after five days in the mountain they are still in almost unmarked condition~ which for me with my gear is unheard of.
125,mammut,kento-high-gtx,3.0,"   Very light~ but vulnerable and smelly (?)   Pros   Cons   I came across this type of shoes in Zermatt and was struck by both its characteristics~ and its low price (particularly for Zermatt and Switzerland): 279 CHF/ 253 €. It also stood out by being made of  ""old fashioned"" one piece leather~ while still appearing to be light and compact.   I did not intend to buy new boots~ having bought my previous ones only two years before and being pretty satisfied with those. But I seized the opportunity~ also hoping to find a better fit than my previous ones.   I have used this pair during three alpine climbs on 4000 meter peaks around there~ so they have been tested just long enough to know what to expect.   I will discuss some aspects I noticed~ sometimes comparing to my previous pair of boots~ Garmont Tower Extreme LX GTX ~ and my oldest pair~ Scarpa Cerro Torre.   So concluding~ pretty good boots for an attractive price. But I worry how long they will last. I consider contacting Mammut about the issues I already have.       Update 1   I did contact Mammut about the issues~ referring to this review including the pictures which is a pretty clear story I would think. They insisted on getting the boots sent to them~ so I did. It took some weeks for them to get back on it~ but they offered to swap for a new pair.   Because I worried that a new pair would suffer the same problems~ and I also had some fitting problems~ we also discussed other models. But there was no interesting option for me~ so I opted for the same model.   The peculiar thing was that they offered me orange or brown ones instead of the blue I had~ and preferred. I chose orange~ but got brown sent to me. The only colour I did NOT want. I really don’t get that. They are a manufacturer~ I imagine they have a warehouse full of all colours and sizes.   I chose to just give them feedback on that~ but to keep the pair. The good thing of course was that they swapped. But I still worry how long this pair will last.   Update 2   I used the new pair this summer and did three climbs with it. So far not the same problems.   But I got some new ones. To my surprise~ I got serious blisters on both heels~ even though I had broken in the boots for a couple of hours. The first pair was used sort of right out of the shop.   The other thing was that the leather got drenched. Maybe this happened because these boot were untreated before use. Maybe for the same reason I did not have the smell problem again. My feet kept dry thanks to the Goretex.   Because I worried about the leather~ I treated them back home with Nikwax."
126,mammut,kento-high-gtx,3.0,   Good boots...but not for heavy duty jobs.   Pros   Cons   Same problems.
127,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   These are by far the best mountain boots ever conceived. The boots are of a very heavy leather that will last for better than a quarter century if taken care of. I have a new pair coming from France in a week or two and this will make my second pair since 1978. At 55 these will outlast my ability to climb.      Update three weeks into breakin and its good to have a good pair of boots on my feet again. I have been wearing these every day for the last three weeks and they are feeling like old friends. My last pair lasted thirty three years with four rebuilds so if these go half that long or~ if I can go that long again I can't ask for more. The folks out there that say Galibier boots are out dated are not in their boot seven days a week if they were they would love the Super Guides.   Pros   Cons   I have logged many miles in my SG's and have never been unhappy. I use Superfeet Orange orthotics to absorb some shock and cradle my heal and have never had a problem with blisters.   In the cold places like Rainer or Hood I use 40 Below Purple Haze overboots that work very well with the SG's and my Petzl Vasak crampons. I used these boots to complete Pre-Ranger training at Ft Lewis in 1979 and then in the Mountain phase of U.S. Army Ranger School~ then for years in the 2/75 TH RANGERS.   I have used them as a USFS Wilderness Ranger in the Eastern Sierras and on every unnamed mountain top I could manage to get to the top of. They can be hard to break in but with the right receipt it goes kind of quick. 3 parts rubbing alcohol~ 1 part water with a little dish soap in a spray bottle soak down boots put them on and walk~ squat~ bend and start the process over every time they start to dry. After break in I use only the Original Snow Seal twice a year with some touch ups if needed.   I have also used some of the new glued together boots and the only thing they have I like are the Rands. They have all lasted less than 3 years so are worthless. In my humble opinion you can not go wrong by paying a little extra for a boot that will be around longer than most people will use them.   They are true to size and are built wider in the toes and narrower in the heal. I wear a size 8.5 in regular shoes and a 9 in the SG's~ wearing SmartWool Mountaineering Socks with a thin liner sock. The only thing better than a pair of Galibier Super Guides would be two pair.
128,galibier,super-guide,5.0,"   The Galibier boots are still made but nowadays they are all stamped in the upper leather with the label ""Parachoc."" They are still made in France by Richard Pontvert's famed Paraboot Company. One can still buy them from e-Killibre Outillage in France and they ship to the U.S. via the French Post Office's La Poste's version of Japan's EMS mail service~ Collisimo tracking service~ within two weeks at the most.   The three boots in the Parachoc line are the famed Super Guide and Vercors — both with the Makalu sole. There is also an urban version~ Super Touring~ with a flexible sole~ the Khumbru. I have the latter and it is a well-constructed leather boot on a narrow last.   I don't agree with the other reviewers about the sizing. The current Parachoc Galibier are built on European sizing and run TTS. Upper leather on my Super Touring are stiff and so take time to break in but the midsole is immediately comfortable out of the box.   I would say if you go to the back country often~ one would benefit from a boot with a stiff sole like the Super Guide with the Makalu sole — you'll be thankful for the foot and ankle support on rough~ treacherous and unyielding terrain. It's probably overkill for vacation walking and occasional off-trail hiking and most people would be happier with the Super Touring boot and its more flexible and forgiving Khumbru sole.   That said~ it remains the greatest pair of traditional all-leather mountain boots ever made. All the boots made today~ including the Limmers~ stand in the shadow of the famed Parachoc Galibier boots."
129,galibier,super-guide,5.0,"   The best mountain boots ever made.  The design allows for great edging power on alpine rock.  With insulated over-boots I have used these with comfort up to 21~000 in Peru/Bolivia.  The good news is that they are still being made in France.  You can buy new Galibier Super Guides~ still made by Richard Pontvert~ for about 250.00 including air freight from ""Au vieux campeur"".  They are located throughout France~ but they also have a website from which you can order the Galibier boots.  It helps to read a bit of French.  The good news for people with big feet is that you can also get the Super Guides up to size 15!"
130,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   These are super general mountaineering boots but you'll probably never be able to find them.  Lots of support~ stiff soles but still comfortable on the hike in.  I lucked out and found a pair.  They were the ultimate single boot  before the arrival of plastic boots (which I detest).  Excellent quality.  If you can find them and they fit~ buy as many pairs as you can afford.  I got mine at International Mountain Equipment in N. Conway~ NH.  Dirt cheap for what you get.
131,galibier,super-guide,5.0,"   Great boots~ flawless execution. The quality is fantastic with respect to stitch work~ stitches sealing~ leather quality~ finishing~ inside of the boots. Since the boots were coming from France to the USA~ I was not charged the VAT. There are no high altitude mountains in the part of Texas I currently live~ but they will be intensively used on local hikes.   Pros   Cons   Just picked them up from the local USPS today (01/07/2019). Got the pair in EU size 42 from Au Vieux Campeur In France and the experience in dealing with them has been more than excellent.   Put a pair of Superfeet Orange insoles in (as recommended by some of you). Remember you will need to trim these as the toe box tapers in on the narrow side. They fit like a glove~ using my Smartwool inner liner sock combined with the heavy duty Smartwool outer sock.   No qualms whatsoever with respect to my feet. They are very comfortable in the boots. My hotspot is located on the topside~ where the top of the boot tongue meets the shin. They started cutting in there really bad when I took the dogs out for a 3-mile walk on one of our local trails. I need to figure out how to deal with that...unless you good folks have any good tips!   I will try some lacing variations to see if that alleviates the issue. I replaced the standard laces with a pair of 102"" kevlar reinforced laces that are much thicker and seem to hold a better knot.   Not giving up on these boots! I think these boots are far more superior to my Meindl Super Perfects~ boots that I completely destroyed after hikes in the French/Spanish Pyrenees and French/Swiss Alps LONG time ago.    Will post pictures soon.   Experience   Definitely a keeper. Will need to bite through the pain that I am currently experiencing~ but I can see how this will be perfect in the near future."
132,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   Bought my pair in early '70s for $52 in San Diego. They are exceptional mountaineering boots. I have no idea how many total miles since then. Great for off-trail and heavy packs. Third set of soles~ one shank. Untold miles on the PCT~ Continental Divide~ Grand Canyon~ and local California mountains.       Served me well in Mountain Rescue and as a California State Park Ranger. They are sturdy~ comfortable and yes~ heavy~  compared to today's standards.   Pros   Cons   There is some break-in needed. Leather will generally form to the foot. Proper care of leather is important in maintaining these boots. I found no chaffing or blistering. A thinner inner sock with a water wicking outer sock worked very well for me.   Really performed well in loose scree and boulder fields. In the desert they performed well in heavy cactus needle environment. They are stable and give great ankle support. I wore them both in sub-zero and high temperature environments. In snow conditions at night I put them inside a bag at the bottom of my sleeping bag. Used Snow Seal before water or heavy abrasive snow or ice.    With a good cobbler and the right machines the Norwegian or Goodyear welt will allow soles to be replaced. These are not throw-aways in the contemporary sense. Mine were finally retired to a climbing and hiking museum.
133,galibier,super-guide,5.0,"   The boot of boots.   Pros   Cons   Purchased new in Olympia~ Washington~ January 1976 for $125. (The monthly rent on my 2-bedroom apartment at the time was $135.)   Broke them in doing garden work for four years. Broke the original wooden shanks and destroyed the midsole. Had them rebuilt with steel shanks about 1984. They have been resoled at least four or five (?) times~ most recently December 2012.   I use Obenauf's LP leather treatment ONLY~ and have for over 30 years. They are waterPROOF. Three of us went up and down St. Helens in mid-May on slushy snow -- I was the only one who had dry feet when we got back down.   In spite of the abuse they have been subjected to~ they are still holding up 37 years later. After checking the price of new ones~ I'm going to see if I can get another season or two out of these.   After a dismal experience with a pair of the newer design rubber-rand-type boots~ if and when these fail I will shell out the money for another pair~ as after extensive searching I am not finding anything available which is comparable to these.   I noticed comments regarding sizing. Mine are marked ""12"" and have always been a perfect fit~ although I actually wear a 13. I used to wear Thorlos~ but the last several years have worn SmartWools. Never suffered any blisters or discomfort."
134,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   Best boots I ever owned for climbing~ backpacking~ working in the woods.  Excellent foot support and all-day comfort.   Pros   Cons   I bought a pair of Super Guides in 1970 for ice and snow climbing. I was still growing~ sold them~ and bought a pair of Super Pros with plastic caps to protect the toe when kicking steps in snow and ice.  Extensive alpine climbing and working in the Alaska bush.    Unfortunately I outgrew them also~ and didn't know you could still buy them!  If you dry them in gentle heat to prevent mold~ and keep the reasonable treated with a quality boot wax~ the will last for decades.    Amazing comfort and support. 
135,galibier,super-guide,5.0,"   I had two pairs of Super Guides circa 1970-'71 and currently have a pair of Makulus; I have had and do have famous custom boots and many pairs of ""big name"" European boots. I have worn boots of this type in the mountains of BC and Alberta~ year-'round~ for 50 years and for both work and recreation.   I completely concur with the previous gentleman's opinions on these and now am going to order 1 or 2 more pairs of the Vercours~ which are enough boot for my 65 year old body.   I am tempted to get SGs just because~ but~ I doubt that I would use them often now~ best dang boots I ever have worn~ period."
136,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   These boots are without question absolutely awesome~ no other modern boot will stand up to the abuse that these have suffered over the years~ all 25 of them (so far) and they are still going.   OK so you cannot fit the new modern crampons (G14 and Rambo style) to them but they were not designed for that climbing anyway. With standard alpine/winter crampons (G12 new classic style) you can climb Scottish grade V and alpine ED and north faces these excel and you'll wear out before they do!!!!   They are also fully waterproof for Scottish bog trotting~ not many modern boots will keep out the water for 20 years plus...a bit of TLC after each outing with Grangers G-wax~ a quick polish~ and off you go.   They are still made in France near Grenoble and if you google search pellisier sport in Samoens you can still buy a pair!! I've just ordered a new pair myself~ as sooner or later the supply will dry up. Why does the best gear always disappear? (Think of Chouinard.)
137,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I bought a pair of these for a winter mountaineering trip to Katahdin in '78. That trip fell through but was replaced by a week in the Presidentials. Then off to Washington State were these were the perfect boots. The Cascades and Olympics have long approaches where a walking boot is key. Then Alpine pitches to the top. Plus there are these snow cone volcanoes that need a bit of crampon work. These boots did it all.    Downside~ heavy for the walk in. And then my feet spread and I couldn't wear them. I ended up donating them to the Second Hand Climbing store. I hope whoever they fit now enjoys them as much as I did.
138,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   This was the first boot that truely fit me~ so break-in was quick and easy. The last is narrow at the heal and wide at the ball. If that describes your foot~ search for these boots. The wooden midsole makes cramponing long pitches reasonable and keeps feet warm after a day on snowfield and glaciers. Thirty years and more of climbing and ski moutaineering in the Rockies and Cascadia~ they are still as good as~ if not better than~ any other boot I have chanced to use. Totemic objects beyond criticism. Buy them at any cost.
139,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   These are the absolute in a leather climbing boot. I have never been stuck on a wall or anywhere~ for that matter~ that these boots could not carve their way out of. Great for heavy loads. If you can find a pair~ hold on to them~ because they are a one of a kind boot. Very good support.
140,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I bought a pair of Galibier- super guides in 1975 in Iowa City~ Iowa on sale for $40.00 regulary $60.00. They were the best boots I have ever owned.If I had not lost them in 1990 I would sill be wearing them today. They are industructable           Michael P. Kennedy
141,galibier,super-guide,4.0,"   Classic leather mountaineering boot that is still made~ but hard to acquire if you live in USA. Will refine review upon arrival and some trail time.   Pros   Cons   I contacted Pelle Line~ in NJ~ in May 2020. They were nice BUT they wanted $845. So I declined and continued my quest. I contacted Paraboot directly—NO REPLY. I even got a contact at Paraboot~ Pierre Colin~  from Thierry Hoo at alaville-alamontagne.com in France that sells the SG's (but does not ship to USA).   In the end the only current viable source for SG's is Au Vieux Campeur. My last boots (La Sportiva Makalu) were size 42; they lasted 25 years. I ordered size 43~ as the recommendation from Au Vieux Campeur was to order one size up and they did not have size 42. I hope that works out 'cause I don't think I'll be going to Paris anytime soon to exchange!   They are friendly and Google translate is needed as they only speak French and the site is French only. My total shipped to NY~ USA~ was $439.22—boots $377.56 and shipping $61.32 (OUCH!). Billing is in Massy (corporate office location)~ shipped from Paris store. Look forward to their arrival!Picture from Paraboot FaceBook February 8~ 2018Boots arrived 6/23/2020*Quality control is a bit off. One of the D-ring eyelet rivets could have been crimped in place better. It seemed secure but loose enough to allow the eyelet to move about more freely than the others. The welt sealant was missing in a few areas. Aquaseal SR is on order to fix that oversight.   OK~ they are stiff and heavy~ but honestly they don't seem all that much heavier than my LaSportiva Makalus. If you already wear boots  of similar mass I don't think you'll really notice anything different. They do seem to be a bit bigger than I anticipated (43 instead of 42... one size larger than foot size~ as recommended). But~ that is not really a lot of difference. I expect that to be a benefit when colder months necessitate warmer/thicker socks.   There seemed to be a bit more internal volume then I expected (I expected bone crushers). My SuperFeet Blue insoles fit nicely and definitely made them feel more comfortable and fill some of that volume. With SuperFeet installed the heel and arch area felt more secure/snug (but not uncomfortable). The toe box had much more room than my LaSportivas... my toes are not touching the front of the boot when pushing foot forward (which would happen in my LaSportiva's).   After an hour I did feel like I wanted to take them off (and so the break-in process begins). My LaSportivas were a BEAR to break in.... months! But~ we became fast friends. Let's talk about the tongue. STIFF AS A BOARD... you could use 'em for a diving board! They ""cut into"" my shins~ it will take a while to break in. Reminded me of the first plastic alpine ski boot I used my first time skiing... Kolfach I think.   Color of the outer  leather is odd... An earthen green is how I describe it. Kinda like if you mixed a clay color with forest green. The boots are still imprinted ""Galibier Super Guide"". However~ it is not embossed rather it looks LASER etched. The box they come in looks just like the old ones I've seen on eBay for vintage pairs of SG's.   Once the Aquaseal SR has been applied to the unsealed welt areas~ I'll begin the applications of Obenauf's and continue the break in process.   Experience   Time and break-in will tell."
142,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I have owned the same boots...seriously! since 1974!    Pros   Cons   I was 15-year-old kid in Alaska and worked several jobs to pay the $250 for them.    Well~ fast forward these many years and I am in Paris with my wife~ I found they still make them and I am headed out to buy another pair and have instructed my wife to cremate me in them!   My dilemma now is I have read a review on the Meindl Super Perfekt.   Experience   Mountaineering on four continents over the past 45 years!
143,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   The best boots money can buy. Well worth every penny.    Pros   Cons   I have wanted a pair of these hand crafted boots for decades. I have just come back from Paris~ and while I was there I bumped into a shop that still sell these wonderful boots. I could not get the money fast enough out of my pocket to buy them.   And now I am at home I put them on~ and they fit perfectly. The workmanship has to be the best I have ever seen on a boot~ be it full leather or any other material. I love these boots so much I have just booked another plane ticket back to Paris to buy two more pairs.   My recommendations~ buy one at any cost. 
144,galibier,super-guide,4.5,"   Last a lifetime.   Pros   They are perfection for what they are designed for — mountaineering. But they also work as a rugged all purpose boot. I bought mine in the early '70s for hiking~ backpacking~ mountaineering~ general wear~ on the job.   Put them away in the '90s in favor of lighter ""modern"" boots~ which I've been very disappointed in. Just dug them out of the ""archives"" and they are like I never left them.   "
145,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I have had these boots more than 40 years. When people tell you they last they are telling you the truth.     Pros   Cons   I have had these Super Guides resoled three times. Rebuilt once. My only regret is I let them talk me into using 3/4 shank instead of full shank. Consequently they aren't as good in vertical rough terrain as they used to be. I coated them with Snow Seal when they were brand new and numerous times since then. My feet have never been wet in these boots.    I have different size feet and was lucky enough that since the boots just came and they had to put up a display model they weren't planning to sell~ they split the sizes for me.
146,galibier,super-guide,4.5,   I bought a very clean~ low miles~ used pair in '79 and they fit me like they were made expressly for my foot!         Pros   Cons   I am not a real 'mountaineer' like some of you folks. l just used them strictly for backpacking in the San Gabriel-San Bernardino mountains in summer and wore them all winter as work and walk around in the snow when I lived up in the San Bernardino Mts at 7~500 ft.   They were so confidence inspiring I gave them to a friend who really needs them and am now on the website drooling over a new pair.   Perhaps I should go down to the less mountaineering oriented version~ the SUPER DEVOLUY.   Here is the website address with the SUPER GUIDE: http://www.chaussure-paraboot.com/fr/11-montagne   For SUPER DEVOLUY go to http://www.chaussure-paraboot.com/fr/5-bucheron   Cheers.
147,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   Climbed and hiked Crested Butte's backcountry for 4 years with them till the young Lab ate them and I moved to the Keys.   Pros   Cons   The above will do.
148,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I bought my Galibier Super Guide boots in about 1976 at Erewhon Mountain Sports in Madison~ WI~ and have used them continuously ever since.    I am a geologist by profession~ and have worn out many heavy duty leather boots in my life~ but other than the soles~ these boots are still great.  I am guessing what I paid~ as 1976 was a while ago.    I highly recommend these boots for anyone who really needs a comfortable~ solid~ exceedingly well-made boot.
149,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   chaussure-paraboot.com/superguide737601-p-105.html   I have found an importer. She orders on Thursdays and it takes about 2 weeks to get the boots from France.   Pelle Line Paramus1148 Garden State PlazaParamus NJ~ 07652(201)845-3040   Fitting and Care of Super Guide Climbing Boots   These boots have a Norwegian Welt and are built on a narrow form.  The outside of the boot is formed  from  one piece of full grain leather from the hip portion of the hide with only one seam in the back. The sole of the boot has a steel plate for protection and rigidly. Do not order these boots if you are not use to walking in a boot with a sole that will not flex. They also make a model with a steel toe so they classify as a military safety boot. To protect your feet  from nails and spikes as well as cactus spines.   Fitting the boots run very narrow length should be 1-2 sizes  longer than a street shoe to prevent jamming  toes going downhill.  Put the boots on and force the toes to touch the front of the boot place two fingers behind  the heel to check for proper length.   Like all old style European leather climbing and ski boots (also Cowboy boots)  they need to be form fitted to your feet.  Fill the boots with warm water and let them sit for an hour. Drain the water out and put the boots on with the socks you intend to wear with them. (Changing out sock every hour helps speed drying time) It usually takes wearing the boots about 3 days for them to dry and form fit to your feet.  If you have any hotspots have a boot maker stretch those areas with a press. Problem areas are the heel~ ball of the foot~ and ankle bone.  These are very stiff boots people that are not use to stiff hard ankle support sometimes have problems with irritation of the Achilles tendon.   Recommend covering the stitching and the welt with a layer of polyurethane sealant to protect them from moisture and abrasion.  Scuff the stitching area with Scotch Bright before using any leather treatment  on the boot. I use a product called PLASTI DIP it is used for covering the handles on tools. Paint several coats on the stitching and build up about a 1/4 inch bead between the welt and the leather of the boot.  This will protect the stitching from moisture and decay.   Water proofing use Beeswax product like Snow Seal rub the product in to warm leather.  The first treatment a pair of boots will soak up an entire can of SnoSeal.  Treat the Inside of the boot  with Saddle Soap or Mink Oil.  I've had several pair of these boots that have lasted 10 - 20 years of daily use by a surveyor that walks 6 - 10 mile a day;  Each pair have been re-soled  3-4 times.    Jim Ranke
150,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   In reading the reviews of the Super Guides I wanted to add my own experience. I bought mine in Lander~ Wyoming~ in '74 and have used them all through the Wind River Range~ Alaska~ Cascades~ New Zealand~ Antarctica~ Svalbard~ Italy...on and on. I often get asked why I still wear these old boots and feel if someone has to ask they won't understand the answer.    They have been resoled 4 times and liners replaced once. I've tried many other boots over the years and nothing has held up to the SG's. For the money spent for the miles on their soles...they were the best buy I probably ever made on a piece of gear.    My feet always feel happy slipping back into these boots. How many other boots or any piece of gear is still working hard for 35 years?
151,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   Like others~ I bought these boots in 1978. They're a bit heavier than more modern styles~ but nothing...I repeat NOTHING....has held up like these boots. I waterproof them with Sno_seal every autumn and still use them on winter hikes. The soles held up well with no cracks or extensive wear~ exterior hides are still as good as new~ and the interior is supple. Never ever got a blister from these babies!   Over the years~ I've walked and trashed my way through a lot of other brands...but these boots ROCK!
152,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   Was going through a closet I hadn't been through for awhile and I came across my old pair of Super Guides that I purchased back in 1977. They still looked in pretty darn good shape and I decided to wear them around for a while. Now I've haven't worn these for probably 26 years and they still fit like a glove~ were a little stiff at first~ but loosened right up. Since my children are into hiking I will definitely continue to wear these awesome old relics. After finding these old boots I went to the web to see if anything was being said about these fantastic old boots and came across this site.
153,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I wore these super boots from yesteryear this week (bought new in '77 for a winter outing up Mt. Katahdin in Maine's Baxter State Park) going up l'il old Mt. Watatic in Ashburnham~ Mass. I will probably be wearing them in N.H.'s Presidential Range this summer. I swear they are just breaking in and they've been worn around winters and summers since '77. I was happily shocked to find them still being crafted and sold in Europe. These should never go out of fashion because they are far from fashionable but they sure as heck are the most serviceable~ longest wearing boots ever made. They rank right up there with Limmers.
154,galibier,super-guide,5.0,   I purchased these boots in 1974. I have had them resoled and they are still like new. These are the best boots that I have ever~ bar none.... I have to wear boots for my job and I wear these boots about 70% of any day. I have not seen these boots for sale anywhere and I have looked... 
155,garmont,tower-gtx,5.0,   Awesome boots!! They were comfortable right out of the box~ and even more so when I used molded inserts. I bought these boots the day prior to mountaineering in the Northern Cascades (thinking that there would be some leather mountaineering boots for rent available in my size~ the day before... there weren't)~ and was a little worried about breaking them in. They felt like sturdy sneakers~ and surprisingly didn't need breaking in at all!    The Gore-tex truly kept my feet dry and comfortable through mud~ snow~ rock~ and ice. The only time my feet were wet was when I didn't wear my gaiters properly. I felt secure and stable standing on the lip of rocky ledges with the tips of these boots; traversing on angled snow glaciers was a breeze with crampons.   The best part of these lightweight boots - no blisters/toe-jams/hot-spots! Unbelievable after a full day's descent from the summit to the car...
156,garmont,tower-gtx,4.0,   Garmont leather boots (and the Zion~ the full leather one is the best) are top notch. They last about five times more than other brands~ such as Marmot~ for heavy backpacking between 1~500 and 5~000m~ for five years~ five times per year.   Pros   Cons   The lining will give in~ but after years of abuse—an easy fix to a local clobber who replaced the lining around the heel with some leather for $25.   I prefer all leather boots such as the Zion and with a bit of wax in between hikes they are indestructible.   Great traction too~ although not an approach shoe and not necessarily for rock scrambling~ but they will do for that as well.   Asolo full leather boots are another great option.   But if you climb higher than 6000m then you need something thicker and better suited for crampons: such as Salewa Pro.
157,garmont,tower-gtx,5.0,   The best hybrid shoe. Great for alpine climbing~ also wary comfort for long hiking. And most imp thing: low price! 120E 
158,garmont,tower-gtx,5.0,   Great summer mountaineering boots. Super light~ stiff enough for snow~ climbs rock much better than most mountaineering boots~ hikes pretty good. Crampon straps will be more uncomfortable on these boots than heavier designs.
159,garmont,tower-gtx,5.0,   I put these boots through the ringer this summer (06) from day long slogs in rain and mud to all day glacier climbs. I have never had boots keep my feet dry like the Tower GTX. Other boots I've had with Gore-Tex liners eventually soak through and at the end of the day my feet are soaked. These boots kept me dry no matter what conditions I've subjected them to. Somehow Garmont figured out how to create a breathable boot that works. They are also incredible on class 3 and 4 terrain. The sole provides excellent smear capability and are stiff enough to give excellent edging stability. Very comfortable!
160,garmont,tower-gtx,5.0,   These boots are the best I've ever worn. Light~ incredibly sturdy and packed full of features that I'll never use in a million years!   This bargain price from a UK store TK Maxx -- seller of discount footware and designer clothes. They do get some bargains in~ so if you're in for a pair of boots~ please check them out! And NO~ I don't work for them! A limited selection~ but you can find some stunning  products.
161,la-sportiva,lhotse-gtx,4.5,   I bought the La Sportiva Lhotse GTX as a serious backpack/mountaineering boot. crampon capable.   I researched boots for several months before coming to this decision. Break in was fine with no blisters. I wear Smartwool socks with liners. The boot is a little heavy for normal packing but I needed something of this caliber to protect my ankles and feet.   Put them to the test on a 10 day backpack hunt in the northern Yukon territory with water crossings multiple times daily~ 40 degree incline scree fields~ loose shale~ boulders~ etc. best all around boot for tundra to rocks. worn with gaiters it makes a great combo. Quality is superb and the toe cap helps protect your feet after you get tired and occasionally kick the permanent rocks embedded in the trail. great sole/tread.   I'm sure I'll have these for many more years to come. Purchased in 2006.
162,la-sportiva,lhotse-gtx,5.0,   No break-in needed. I am 57 and do extreme cold endurance hikes (Mt Wash is favorite). I will grudgingly don crampons. Buy Italian.
163,la-sportiva,lhotse-gtx,5.0,   These are great boots. Mine also did not require a painful break-in period. Comfortable from the beginning.  Very warm. Insulated / Gore-tex. Too warm for spring snow climbing~ when I go back to my old Galibier Super Guides. I spoke with La Sportiva customer service before purchase~ and they said this was just as warm as the Nepal Extreme. What a great deal! 
164,la-sportiva,lhotse-gtx,5.0,   I wore these right out of the box...the ultimate no-no in hiking/mountaineering~ I know. I had absolutely NO problems~ issues~ hot spots~ etc. It's hard to provide a review on footwear~ just because what works great for one might be disastrous for another~ but I will continue to endorse La Sportiva~ even though they're still not paying me to do so!!   My feet are narrow~ low-volume~ so bear that in mind if you're considering these boots.
165,scarpa,mont-blanc-gtx,5.0,   Was warm for a June summit of Mt. Rainier. Felt light on my feet and never had an issue with blisters or wetness.   Pros   After considering plastic vs. leather and insulated vs. non-insulated I centered in on these boots for my June 2012 trip to Mt. Rainier. I used a Camp front bail type crampon and never had it fail me.   The boot was light enough for the all day trek to Camp Muir and warm enough that night when we left for the summit. Coming down it was hot and the snow was soft enough that you plunged two feet down with each step. I never had water come in the boot. The ankle cuff was just snug enough to keep out loose snow that got behind the gaiter.  The Perwanger leather did get a little wet but never came into the boot~ thank you GTX.   Overall~ great three-season mountaineering boot. Very comfortable with an added running shoe liner that I used in the footbed. No hesitation for summer trips. Would think about seals socks to keep inside just a little dryer from the feet sweat. Aired them out midday on way to camp Muir.   I am normally a 12.5-13 or 46.5  and I got the 47. It fit perfectly.
166,scarpa,mont-blanc-gtx,5.0,   Tried Mont Blancs this morning on a two hour mountain hike strait from the box~ was like wearing air inflated socks. I had these as a replacement for faulty Cumbres. To be honest didn't think the Monts would cut it~ but how wrong was I.   I nearly sent them back as the sole wear is not as chunky as the cumbres~ but thought what the hell just have to resole sooner~ but as they are lighter and a tad less stiffer I found there's no dragging or heel slip pulling them down. I will be using them every day for a couple of hours mountain hiking~ ace grip inside and out~ lots of flex~ lots of stability. If they keep up this comfort I'll soon be having a second pair.
167,scarpa,mont-blanc-gtx,5.0,   From day one~ they fit me like a glove! No blisters~ just comfort!   Pros   Cons   I'd had bought a pair of Nepal Evos (La Sportiva)~ but after wearing them a couple of times~ they became very tight on my feet and pushing on my toes~ not comfortable at all. So I sold the EVOs and got a pair of Scarpa Mont Blancs.   They fit me perfectly from day one. Perfect fit on foot~ heel~ and ankle. The lacing system (with a mid point) helps get the right fit both on the feet and ankle part of the boot. I have wide and flat feet~ and Scarpas have always fit me perfectly. Just like other Scarpa boots~ I've never had to break them in and have never had any blisters with them.   Living in NZ it's always hard to find good climbing boots that are light and waterproof enough to endure the long approaches in mixed terrain (kilometers and kilometers of walking along riverbeds and river crossings~ muddy bush tracks~ bush bashing~ and so on)~ but that are still warm and rigid enough to climb snow and ice. I've found this with the Scarpa Mont Blancs.    I've had them for over a year now~ and I'm still very happy with them. They keep my feet warm~ they are snug enough for ice climbing~ but comfortable for walking long distances. They also keep my feet dry and are very breathable. The Vibram sole is pretty grippy and holds well on slippery rocks.    My only tiny nit is the rubber around the front. I'd had it for a couple of weeks and while out on an overnight trip~ I noticed a small crack on the rubber on my toe area. I couldn't be bothered sending it back~ so I just used a product to cover the crack and have been using it  like that since then~ having no more problems. I believe I may have just been unlucky~ but you might want to keep that in mind. 
168,scarpa,manta,4.5,   The most bomb proof and weather proof boots that I have ever had. Period!      Pros   Cons   2009 Original Review:   I jut got a pair of these boots a few weeks ago.   Up to this point I have take them out in a few short hikes. Not enough for a full review~ but here are my impressions so far:   Here is why I took a half star off:    I felt the sole a little slippery when there is mud and rocks are wet. Must of the time I will get a good grip but some times I felt kind of sliding.   I am not sure at this point if the boots were a good selection hiking wise. They are very stiff. This make you feel odd sometimes when walking~ specially on manmade hard surfaces. But the feeling is gone once you are walking on the trail.   Until now no blisters or damage to my feet~ just sore due to the stiffness of the boot. I hope they will break in on time. I will update on this later.   Overall I think they are a great entry level boot although I can not really compare with anything. My previous boots were Nike ATM which is comparing your regular Chevy vs. an Audi.   The boots are good for bush waking~ heavy backpacking. Not 100% sure about pure hiking yet~ but definitely I would recommend them to a friend.   On top of that you do not break the bank and the price difference vs. regular hiking boots is not that much so the extra money is well expended.   2017 update   So it had been 8 years since I bought my Mantas and I have not manage yet to feel like I have broken them in~ although my feet don't feel as sore anymore~ but noticed some pain on my knees once in a while after hiking with the boots~ so I don't use them as often anymore.   Still blame this on the super ridiculous stiff soles. I agree that these are mountaineering boots designed to use with crampons~ hence the stiffness~ but after 8 years they are as stiff as new. On the other hand this speaks volumes of the quality of construction.   They are still fantastic weather wise~ even after walking purposely into a creek ankle deep in freezing water over last weekend they stay dry! Actually I am like a child when wearing this boots. I take any chance to step or jump into a puddle. The leather in this boots is top notch.   After so much time there is some wear on the soles~ and replaced the original laces once. The lacing system just chews them off. Not resoling yet or change in the inner soles. The interior is almost as good as new. The sole rubber is still as slippery as when new so once in a while I get a scare when stepping into wet stones or ice patches.   Have used them for backpacking and hiking in all seasons. Also use them for snowshoeing.   Definitely would buy Scarpa products again~ next time a lighter model perhaps. Something more like light to medium hiking to avoid the stiffness of crampon-compatible boots.
169,scarpa,manta,5.0,   I've had my Mantas for 8 years now and absolutely love them.   As highlighted in other reviews~ I wouldn't use these for general hiking (tend to use some Hi Tec or Brashers for that lark)~ because the sole is stiff. But it's stiff for a reason~ and I'm glad of that stiffness when I'm doing a bit of scrambling~ or covering terrain like Broad Crag; you just don't feel those sharp rocks~ what you do feel is support and stability.   The grip is excellent in my experience. But don't go road racing in them because they're for the mountains.
170,scarpa,manta,5.0,   I was wandering around TK Max (Weston-S-Mare) for a bit of shopping in the Christmas sales and was astonished to stubble across two pairs of Scarpa Mantas amongst a load of clearance clutter (same style as pictured here and both Size 40; so quite small) at only £39!!!  So i snapped up one pair and left the other pair there to make some other small footed mountaineer's day (they could still be there!).        I have been wearing them in and they already feel incredibly warm~ comfortable and relatively light in respect of how durably built they are.  They are very supportive but still allow adequate movement at the ankle and have a very small amount of flex in the rigid sole. This makes them more versatile and comfy on a mountain walk in (which is where some mountain boots can be poor).        I haven't been on the hills in them yet but can't wait to get up to Fort William in two weeks.  
171,scarpa,manta,5.0,   Yet another bargain~ purchased on E Bay when no one else bid for the boots which were brand new. The size 48 is such a large size~ very few folk are in the market for monsters like these.     These are my third set of Mantas. The model has become more heavy duty over the years and now works well in winter~ even with semi step in crampons~ as there is a ledge at the back of the heel. They were comfortable straight out of the box and have given me fantastic service in Slovenia~ Spain~ France~ Norway~ New Zealand and Scotland.     Great support~ very warm~ VERY water resistant. The soles had worn out so I had them resoled. Now they are like new again.  The reason they are up to major repair is the very heavy high quality reversed leather used in the construction~ which means their performance has not been compromised over time.     They're not the lightest of boots~ but totally bomb proof and like wearing carpet slippers. An absolute classic boot that has got better over the years.
172,scarpa,manta,5.0,   The test of time proves a boot. I still use my 10 plus year old heavier style green pair and they have been flawless. To this day~ no matter how may days or months on my feet backpacking~ my feet always feel great at the end. The Manta is the perfect three season boot that provides support and protection~ comfortable when wet~ and perfect for every terrain.
173,scarpa,manta,4.5,   Bought Mantas about ten days before heading to Lochaber/Glencoe for a week's winter climbing. Wore them around town for the week before we left.    Boots were great. Some pressing into the top of my foot where the bottom end of the tongue meets the boot proper~ but nothing too bad~ and possibly due to the short break-in period I'd allotted myself. Dry~ warm~ comfortable~ light~ strong~ fantastic grip/edging~ good in the crampons.
174,scarpa,manta,5.0,   These are without doubt the best boots I have ever owned. The competition has been stiff over the years: Vasque~ Merrell~ Raichle and other high end (and heavier) products. The Mantas combine superlative fit~ function~durability~ material and build quality in an integrated design which is remarkable.    They seem to have been fabricated by artisans who are still dedicated to the quality of the hand made. On the trail they perform with extraordinary competence. I had no difficulty with break-in times or with weight.    In a boot of this sort~ the Mantas are likely the best in the world. I also appreciate their traditional and minimalist look.
175,scarpa,manta,5.0,"   Having read some of the other reviews~ I cannot believe that writers have anything negative to say about the Scarpa Manta. I have tried all makes over the years and can honestly say that these boots are probably the most well made I have ever owned.    I have battered them all over the Scottish Highlands~ the English lake district and many parts of the Massif Central (France)and they have never~ ever faltered. I have very little information as to how Scarpa process the crosta leather for this boot but it is absolutely bombproof~ this leather will not rip~ split or leak~ period! Save your money~ don't fall for false economy~ buy once~ buy the Manta.    I am 6ft 2"" about 13st and normally wear a size 43 (Euro) shoe. My feet are very slim with high arches."
176,scarpa,manta,4.0,   Great boot~ bomber leather. I did not have any problems with break-in -- I brought them home~ waxed them (Sno-seal)~ and wore them to work for a week and on walks around the neighborhood.    The next weekend I took them on an 8-mile hike (roundtrip) with 4000 ft gain~ no problems. Boot felt great. Developed a few hotspots in my heel due to heal-lift~ but a quick change in lacing technique locked that down and I had no blisters.   The boot already feels great -- great combo of stiff and supple where I need them. They accepted my orthotics perfectly.
177,scarpa,manta,5.0,   Excellent full shank all leather hiking/mountaineering boot~ takes C2 crampon~ beautifully made~ break-in period is bit tough (3-4 months) no blisters though. Now after 10 months they are superb~ so comfortable~ great support~ agility~ and feel great.    Excellent for hopping around on the rocks at high altitude or for fast descents~ useful for climbing too as sole is very stiff. Not great on approaches when breaking in~ but ok now. They look great still~ the reversed leather means no scuffing as with traditional leather. This is not a boot for approaches or general walking but is superb for heavy backpacking rough trails or entry level mountaineering.   I think the RSN last suits slightly slimmer foot that I have and I do find Scarpa's a little on the small size. As for toe box curling and shortening I haven't experienced that yet and have done well over 100 miles over very rough terrain. I'm using superfeet hiker green insoles which work great~ but I do concur with previous review~ don't go for anything thicker than superfeet as the ankle will roll. I use Bridgedale socks I find they are excellent. I'm looking forward to many years pleasure from my Scarpa Mantas.
178,scarpa,manta,3.0,   Not sure where I stand with this boot. They are however~ undoubtedly the ultimate in a bombproof leather boot~ almost too much so. I've been on three dozen dayhikes~ eight ascents of Mt. Washington and it does not feel as though I've made a dent in the break-in. My feet literally get trashed wearing these~ last hike left me barely walking. My guess is the fit~ as I have wide~ flat feet and they just never seemed to conform to my big dogs.   If you're considering these~ make certain the fit is perfect. Quality is top notch and cannot get much better. I ended up putting mine on consignment after last week's Mt. Jefferson assault which left my feet in severe pain.
179,scarpa,manta,5.0,"   ok~ i love my Mantas! however~ i did experience ""break-in hell"" (about 75 mils worth). here's why: my weight (155 lbs soaking wet)~ and more importantly the shape of my foot (high arch~ narrow foot~ narrower heel). i've experienced all of the blister and hot-spot problems that are listed in the other reviews. if you have similar problems~ then here's the fix: ditch the Scarpa insoles and invest in Superfeet insoles (or the like)~ use moderate to thick socks~ and (very important!!!) use an alternate lacing method to pull the heel cup of the boot snugly onto your heel. after performing the above listed ""fixes"" i'm not only blister-free~ but i'm also able to use liners in conjunction with anything except a thin sock...no problems!    i've pretty much abused these boots on/off trail with up to 60+ lbs on my back~ and they've ALWAYS performed exceptionally well (er~ now that they actually fit).   one word of caution: be careful of the insole that you choose. Superfeet are AWESOME~ but thin. i've tried other insoles that were thicker~ but they had a tendency to make the boot prone to roll-over....ankles beware!"
180,scarpa,manta,2.0,   As someone else posted the curve of the boots does shorten them so be very careful sizing them. I have some bad blistering on the heel.   One of my workmates has the same boots and the soles have parted company with the rest of the boot and it looks like mine will do the same~ after only 3 months. Not what I expected with such a good boot.
181,scarpa,manta,5.0,   Quite simply the best heavy duty backpacking boots I have ever tried.  What sets them apart in my mind is the wonderful rocker of the sole.  The boots roll so easily from heel strike to toe push.  I've tried some boots that have so much rocker as to make them feel unstable and others with not quite enough so there is a flat spot mid-stride that interrupts the roll of the foot.  These~ for me anyway~ have the perfect natural rolling motion~ which is a good thing because the soles flex very little~ even after 2 years of use.  Initially I had heel blister problems~ those ended when I stopped using liner socks and just used a good pair of smartwool or mid-weight Wigwam merino wool socks.     The other thing that I love about these boots is the soft~ flexible boot top.  Other boot of this weight~ and even some much lighter~ have a tendency to dig into my ankle and shin which causes much pain~ especially during break-in~ but the tops of these feel like converse all-stars.  No digging~ no pinching.  But somehow they still manage to give excellent support.  I don't know how they do it.     Most comfortable boot I've ever used~ and I've used a lot (Raichle~ Vasque~ Montrail and One Sport~ Solomon~ Asolo~ Merrell~ to name a few).
182,scarpa,manta,4.0,   Very rugged boot! But a little on the heavy side. I can't seem to wear them out. Thinking about switching to a lightweight boot but hate to give up the durability. The sole is a little bit too stiff unless you plan to use crampons.
183,scarpa,manta,5.0,"   These boots are simply terrific! The upper is perhaps the best Italian leather and construction available. The full-grain leather is impregnated with silicone (Scarpa's HS12 treatment) which is reported to be superior to traditional tanning techniques. The sole is Vibram (M4 lug pattern) with a  nylon Performance Flex midsole. Longitudinal flexion is well balanced aganist lateral support~ but take note~ they will feel stiff when initially worn.     Break-in is easy if done slowly and in small increments. The only problem I had was at the  ankles which were rubbed medially by the edge of the boots' tongues. A quick e-mail to the Scarpa website (http://www.scarpa.co.uk) solved the problem -- some ""trick lacings"" and strategic conditioning. And~ ""yes they do respond to e-mail inquiries from the U.S"" despite what it says on the main menu. The boots are crampon compatible (B1 types) and come in one color: offically chestnut but visually your basic dark brown. The boots are near-waterproof and dry quickly when wet. The liner is a gray synthetic and rough so a pair of good trail socks is a must.  After some radical terrain and severe abuse (i.e.~ 50 lb. pack~ mud-to-sand transitions & sharp rocks)~ the boots cleaned up well and suffered only a few minor scuffs.   I'd strongly recommend these boots to anyone with a ""European foot"" or one shaped to fit the Scarpa BX last which to me seems more tapered in the toe box and of greater volume than traditonal American lasts such as those used by Merrell~ Limmer~ or L.L. Bean. It's also a serious (and pricey) boot for serious use - ain't no fashion boot dude!"
184,scarpa,manta,4.0,   These boots are not as hard to break in as some seem to think.  The stiffness of the leather has helped me in walking downhill on rocky terrain.  The soles have a good grip and are comfortable with the vibram soles.
185,scarpa,manta,2.0,   Just got these and after a 10 mile heavy-pack trip and about 10 pounds of trashed moleskin later I'm hurtin. I wore them for quite awhile before the trip. When will I learn? Big 'ol blisters on my heels. They seem to be as stiff as new. Hmmmm. I'm betting that I can get to the bone on my heels in no more than a week's time! They fit Charlet Moser 12pt Rapidfix step-in crampons really well.   -Hopefully the pain will end soon!   -RMB
186,scarpa,manta,5.0,   Excellent Boots. Plenty of support~ good waterproof leather~ light - if anyone thinks they're heavy~ they must have been wearing trainers all their life.  Broke in very quickly~ and I've never had a blister.  Used in Himalaya for non tecnical glacier walking and non techical peak ascent~   Best £120-00 I've ever spent!!
187,scarpa,manta,2.0,"   I checked out this site to see what other people thought of this boot~ and decided to write this review in response to Nick's (no offense mate). I work as an alpine/bushwalking guide on 6 day walks through a wide range of weather and track conditions.  After a full six months of this (in addition to recreational hiking)~ my boots are still far from broken in~ and have caused me all sorts of problems.  They seem fairly well made~ but the rigid performance-flex vibram sole is impractical on extended and/or frequent hikes where comfort and foot preservation become major concerns.  I'm hoping that any day (week~ month) now they will finally conform to my feet and live up to the hype...   To be honest~ I've been less than impressed.  Unless you have a good reason for doing otherwise (e.g money~ or the weight -saving and versatility of an ""all rounder"" boot) I'd suggest buying a good hiking boot (such as the cheaper and better Scarpa SL) and a more specialised boot for any mountaineering you intend to do."
188,scarpa,manta,3.0,   Just read Dave's review of this boot -- no offense taken.  I guess my earlier review could be misleading.  I bought this boot strictly for light mountaineering - milder weather conditions where I nonetheless need a step-in crampon.  I agree that the boot is too heavy and stiff for casual hiking; I usually wear sneakers or light hikers for anything short of conditions when I wear the Mantas.  I can't explain the unusually short break-in period I experienced.  The boot shape must be very well suited to my foot shape.
189,scarpa,manta,5.0,   Fabulous boot.  I found the warnings about a long break-in period to be overdone.  I wore the boots for two little walks around my neighborhood (maybe 3 miles in total) and then hiked the avalanche gulch route of Mt. Shasta.  No blisters~ no hot shots~ perfect performance.  Perfect for moderate mountaineering.  They are crampon compatible and fairly light-weight for a heavy-duty boot~ and the leather never (at least on my Shasta hike) gets wet.
190,scarpa,manta,5.0,   The Scarpa Manta in my humble opinion is one of the greatest boots in the world.  They have fine Italian leather with a relativly stiff nylon shank and a Vibram sole that easily accepts most if not all crampons.  This boot however during its break in period will not be your favorite chill shoes but~ after they start to break in its true comfort all day long.
191,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,"   The standard by which other mountaineering boots are measured.   Pros   Cons   I was surprised by the one-star review for this product~ until I read the full review. As a person who has been mountaineering for over 37 years~ I felt the need to comment.   I have to swallow hard these days when entering an outdoor store. Shops that were once the domain of self-reliant enthusiasts have been replaced by a ""new"" breed of outdoor consumer. They increasingly shop by online reviews~ like this one~ or by taking the word of a store associate who has ""unknown"" experience.   I am amazed at the level of trust that people assign to complete strangers. This is not like buying a tennis racket or a golf club. Mountaineering is an inherently dangerous sport. I have many dead friends to prove this statement.    These boots are meant for general mountaineering and ice climbing. The leather construction makes them extremely durable but a little on the heavy side. The interior tongue can be moved to fill the volume in the boot and achieve a perfect fit. The lace locks create different tension from the top and bottom of the boot to allow articulation in the ankles when using 10 point crampons.   However as a single boot they have their limitations when the temperature drops. An insulated supergaiter or over-boot will help. However you will be better served with some of the warmer and lighter products currently on the market."
192,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,1.0,"   Despite being called Nepal Extreme these boots are NOT suitable for use in EXTREME conditions in NEPAL or elsewhere. Two of our team wearing them suffered frostbite wearing these boots at 5930 metres in Nepal.     Despite the very misleading name~ these boots are not recommended for use over 4000 metres. On a recent trip to Nepal at 5930 metres the only two people wearing these boots suffered frostbite requiring hospital treatment.   I have contacted the manufacturers who claim they are not recommended over 4000 metres although I cannot find this information on their website. I was taken in by the name and descriptions of suitability for ""high altitude~"" ""mountain terrain and ice"" etc~ but have suffered the consequences of frostbite."
193,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   Very warm and robust.   Pros   Cons   Superb boots. Would highly recommend where a warm~ comfortable~ and robust boot is needed.   Experience   Stok Kangri.
194,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,4.5,   Absolutely outstanding boots. Very rarely do I manage to find boots which fit me straight out of the box. Very warm~ super comfy and the versatile lacing/tongue system allows for a varied configuration to achieve a prefect fit.   Pros   Cons   Absolutely outstanding boots. Very rarely do I manage to find boots which fit me straight out of the box. After renting a pair from Cotswold Outdoor to test them~ I went straight out and bought some from Go Outdoors.   With a little practice finding out the best placement for the tongue (which is removable and re-positionable) they fit me very well. After a couple of uses they are pretty much broken in~ and provide enough flex in the upper that flat-footing is comfortable. As for step-kicking and general grip they are fantastic.   My one~ small gripe is that they are a little on the heavy side~ but they are an older design. Seemingly now superseded by the very pricey Evo GTX version.   If you're looking for the ideal winter mountaineering boot for Scotland (or summer alpinism) then look no further. Very warm (though obviously if you're going up K2 you'll need a bit more)~ super comfy and the versatile lacing/tongue system allows for a varied configuration to achieve a prefect fit (or as close as my feet will ever allow!)  
195,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   I initially bought these for a 5500m peak in Nepal~ but have since used them for summer alpine use and Scottish winter. Utterly bomb proof~ comfortable and warm- would never consider another brand.
196,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   Superb boot -- a little on the heavy side these days but ultra well made and comfy. I use them primarily for water ice climbing and they are awesome.
197,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   There is no route I would not attempt in these alpinist's dream boots. The break in was short~ very short. The fit was perfect in about ten minutes of fiddling with the system.   There is only one drawback to these boots: It is a profound mistake for a typical dirtbag climber to try these on as there is no way to resist their supple beauty and function; money will leak out of every pocket until there is none left. Try these on at your own peril...they will own you if you do!
198,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,4.0,   I have asked to be buried in my Nepals when I die~ if that's any indication how much I love them. Not always the most comfortable~ but my feet are super-sensitve. I found the trick to be the right combination of liners and socks and tightening the laces just enough to make the boot snug~ but not too tight. They are a touch narrow up front.  I've worn them on long hikes (7+hours) at -20F and done alright. I don't think that's possible in any other single leather boot. The best thing is that they CLIMB. When other guys are stopping to put on crampons~ I'm still cutting into hard~ steep snow and able to keep moving.  I'm looking for a pair of Nepal Tops now.
199,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,"   These are the FINEST boots I've ever had on my feet~ hands down - no comparison. None. They are extremely rigid~ but flex perfectly at the ankles for French tech. So far~ only worn around ""town"" - nothing in the hills~ but would take them anywhere~ anytime for nearly anything (not dancing). Walked about enough to expect blister(s)~ but nothing of the sort - right out of the box. Also~ these were an unbelievable deal as they retail list for $420.00. The laces are a little short and LaSportiva USA has kinda been dragging they feet on replacements - ""out of stock""~ etc. Have had several other less rigid boots on my feet (properly fitted by ""certified"" fitters - myself included) and nothing else even remotely comes close."
200,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   I recently bought these puppies~ and let me tell you- they are spectacular boots. I had envisioned several awefull months of breaking them in~ but to my suprize-they treated me like an old friend on our very first ice climbing adventure. I think that this is were the Nepal Extremes really demonstrate their prowess. In snow and on the approach~ these boots keep my feet very warm~ with nary a wimper. And when we hit the ice~ they are eager to front point and french technique all day long. I almost feel bad about putting them away at the end of the day... If your interested in a boot that was built for serious winter use and abuse~ the Nepal Extreme is you tour de force!!
201,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   I purchased these boots~ before the winter started~ as I live in an exposed part of the United Kingdom. When I first got them~ I thought they were going to be heavy~ and difficult to walk in. To my surprise~ the weren't. They took 2 weeks to break in~ and are extremely warm.   I would recommend these boots to anyone. A++++   Update: April 12~ 2000   When I purchased these boots~ I thought that they might need some breaking in. But to my shock~ the fitted like a glove from day one~ and they are very comfortable to walk in.
202,la-sportiva,nepal-extreme,5.0,   I am on my 2nd pair of Nepal Extremes and find them the perfect Alps or Scottish winter climbing boot. They fit great~ take minimal bedding in~ they're warm. The old style Vibram commando sole unit is the best of any boot I have ever used. On cold winter~ the lack of a Gore-Tex lining is good as well~ makes the boot better-breathing. Brilliant boots~ buy some!  
203,koflach,degre,4.5,   Fantastic for what it is built to do.   Pros   Cons   I just got back from a 5-day excursion in Northern Ontario. These were the only boots/shoes I brought. When not needed for more trying climbs/hikes~ the boot was real easy to adjust loosely around the foot to be worn like a pair of slippers. The fit was right on the money with my measurements.   Also~ the boots stayed warm in temps that hovered in the negative teens F. Only in a few instances were my toes cold~ very rarely. Snowshoeing in these boots was a dream. Longest hike was just under 13 miles and only slight shin bruising after the day occurred. Once your body builds up a tolerance~ it is no big deal. I was actually quite surprised how comfortable these were to hike in.   The soles offered great adhesion to the different types of surfaces we encountered. Not once did they slip. The liners are easily removable and quick to dry.    Overall~ these are a fantastic general mountaineering boot. They handle everything well....which is fine by me.
204,koflach,degre,3.0,   Boot does well for snowshoeing~ non-vertical cramponing but fails miserably at going down hill with heavy pack. You will lose your big toes. Guaranteed.
205,koflach,degre,3.0,   Pretty unimpressed with these boots--the construction isn't up to the same quality as Scarpa~ and once the insulation packs out a little experienced heel lift~ which is horrendous for front pointing. The lacing system requires too much force to tighten--I have gotten blisters from trying to do up the laces (and it's not because I have soft hands--I've never experienced anything like it before).     On the positive side~ the ankle flex makes them comfortable to walk in.   I certainly wouldn't buy them again though.  If only Scarpas fit my feet...
206,koflach,degre,4.0,   Sweet boots... used on some pretty sick vertical combined with Grivel 2f crampons~  comfy for medium approaches~  dry as it gets~ and kept my feet toasty when every one else was headed for the cars (30 below)  The lacing system is kinda a pain though... takes blisters in your fingers to get them tight enough for a proper fit.
207,koflach,degre,5.0,   Excellent boots. Easy to maintain. Light. Robust. Used for Search and Rescue in UK.   Pros   Cons   Brought those boots to use them on the winter for Search and Rescue. They are a bit overkill for UK~ but the low maintenance costs are the plus side. Used them on Scotland when climbed Ben Nevis and proven again that Koflach still remains a strong boot for the serious climber.   Six out of five stars. 
208,koflach,degre,5.0,   I like the best! Koflach has been pioneers and has been around the longest. Solid durable boot that's warm and holds up under the most demanding of circumstances.    Pros   I have my assistance guide license in Alaska. I guide for Dall sheep mostly and the terrain in which they live demands a top shelf boot. Packing up to 140 pounds in our packs quite commonly also demands a solid supportive boot. They are lightweight~ and the removable liner is nice for drying out.   I really like the Koflach Degre and plan on using them for years to come.
209,koflach,degre,5.0,   Awesome boots. Have used them on numerous Cascade climbs including Rainier~ Adams~ Hood~ etc. I have never had cold or wet feet while using these boots. I simply do not have to worry about my feet while wearing these boots. They are warm even when liner is damp~ have a very stiff sole (great for crampons) and are fairly lightweight. Highly recommend them and would not think of doing any ice/snow climb without them. I tape up my feet good before wearing them and put sock liners on and I have never suffered from anything but minor blisters. Great Boots.
210,koflach,degre,5.0,   Excellent boots for snowshoeing and general traversing w/ crampons in cold weather.  Koflach's new plastic is very maleable & the ankle~ so that your feet don't even realize that they're in plastic boots when snowshoes or crampons are strapped on (fixed Sabertooth crampons fit nicely).  Your feet are not too happy however when you decide to bareboot it for long distances.  But that is a gen'l complaint about plastic...
211,koflach,degre,4.0,   Excellent for the stated uses; not best suited for vertical ice climbing but perfect for hiking in the ridiculously cold temps of the northeast.  Only dislike is that they are rough on the feet when you have to do several miles of barebooting...
212,koflach,degre,5.0,   This boot is sweet! My first pair of plastic boots.  Good for travel in Southeast Alaska with wet snow~ cold nights~ and leather freezing conditions.  Good traction~ comfortable~ warmer than a toaster oven~ sensitive~ and chicks dig 'em.
213,koflach,arctis-expe,4.0,   Easy to walk in.   Pros   Cons   I take a size 10.5 in my summer hiking boots and the 11's with Smartwool mountain socks fit great.I bought these boots for camping because you can take the inner boot with you in the sleeping bag and they are sturdy also for hiking in the White Mountains.   The weight of the boots doesn't bother me~ but I found that the inner boot rubs below the calves so I wrap them. I'm guessing it's because I have skinny legs. I have used them three times~ once camping in about negative 10 degrees and my feet did feel the cold slightly. The other two times was hiking in the White Mountains~ about 0 degrees and recently hiking Mount Osceola and it was about 10 degrees.   Crampon use is easy~ once you've done it a few times.   Update November 2018: It has been about seven winters and the inserts will need to be replaced. I'm still using the same boot laces and the soles look good.   I have used these boots every time it's below 20 degrees.   Used them on Mount Washington~ overnight hike the Bonds~ overnight hike the Wildcats~ and a Mount Katahdin seven-day hike~ not the best boots for the long road walks to the trailheads.  
214,koflach,arctis-expe,4.5,   The Koflach Arctis expedition mountaineering boots is made for extreme cold weather conditions. It has been a popular choice for many climbers for trips such as Denali~ Elbrus~ and the Himalayas.    Pros   Cons   The Koflach Arctis expedition mountaineering boots are made for extreme cold weather conditions. It has been a popular choice for many climbers for trips such as Denali~ Elbrus~ and the Himalayas. I have used it in -7°F weather at Mt Rainier and Mt Whitney~ and they kept my feet very warm.   The double plastic construction is practically indestructible~ and the liner insert shoes will help in drying the shoes faster if required. I can do class 3 moves and some class 4 moves; however~ they are very big~ so keep in mind that they are not designed for extremely technical routes. They are meant for deep snow conditions.
215,koflach,arctis-expe,5.0,   I have had these boots for 8 years. Climbed around the Cascades~ up Rainer~ in Canada and they are hands down~ the most comfortable and reliable. I have never had any foot problems~ i.e. blisters. They are flexible and easy to walk in~ whether glacier scree or pavement~ they walk about as easy as any hiking boot.    They are a cold weather boot though. On Rainer my feet were hot and sweaty~ even in 10 F weather. Awesome for ice climbing. I use a rigid frame crampon and they make front pointing a breeze. A couple of things that are irritating are that the black rubber toe welt started separating early from the yellow plastic and the top edge of the liners where the black inner lining meets the silver plastic edge wore through. So now the foam insulation sticks out~ but who cares~ its under the gaiters.    Overall a superb boot~ bummer that Koflach isn't importing boots anymore.
216,koflach,arctis-expe,4.0,   I thoroughly enjoyed these boots for the three+ years that I had them. They were incredibly warm even in the coldest temps. I've used them trekking up through talus~ on snowfields and glaciers~ and on vertical ice.     Which leads me to the end of my boots. I was climbing a pitch of vertical ice and one of my boots cracked on the top front over the toes. Luckily~ I wasn't on an expedition.   In their defense~ they still kept my feet dry after I stepped into a creek on the descent!  
217,koflach,arctis-expe,5.0,   These boots rock! People may whine about them being heavy compared to leathers~ but it simply isn't a factor. I haven't noticed them being heavier than leathers once they're on my feet. I've ice climbed in them several times now and they frontpoint better than my La Sportiva Nepals. As for walking around they have enough of a rocker sole to be comfortable. Plus~ when winter camping you cannot beat the removable liners. No cold feet again!
218,koflach,arctis-expe,5.0,   Классные ботинки для покорения вершин зимой. Рекомендую.      [Google Translate: Cool shoes to conquer the peaks in the winter. I recommend.]   Pros   Cons   Очень теплые. Удобные во время ходьбы. Не пропускает воду и удобны для одевания и зашнуровувания. Реально класные ботинки. Кошки держатся плотно. На высоте выше 6000 метров показывают себя комфортными и теплыми. А в зимних Карпатах даже жарко в них. Поэтому рекомендовал бы их для высот за 5000м.         [Google Translate: Very warm. Comfortable while walking. It does not let water pass and is convenient for dressing and lacing. Really great shoes. Crampons keep tight. At an altitude above 6000 meters~ they show themselves comfortable and warm. And in the winter Carpathians it's even hot in them. Therefore~ I would recommend them for heights of 5000 m.]
219,koflach,arctis-expe,4.5,   
220,koflach,arctis-expe,3.0,   I purchased these 30 cm monsters in Japan (where I live and climb)~ mainly because there was no other boot that would fit my feet. The shop owner threw in an extra pair of liners 'cause customers for this particular size range are evidently far and few between. The extra set is one size down and fits with single socks and possibly from an older model i.e. velcro~ no laces.   Have used the boots for three seasons. Here's what I've learned about them:   1. Super warm. I've used the smaller liners 90% of the time~ even in -18 to -20c temperatures. Have started using the lace ups only because the smaller ones have begun to rip apart near the velcro wings and sewing by hand has proven ineffective. The lace ups require double socks~ are too warm and end up getting very wet inside (the moisture from using the smaller liners with one pair of socks for a week one time was tolerable~ though my partners may not have thought so).   2. Super rigid~ so great for front-pointing vertical ice and  rock. They fit my feet perfectly so there's no problem with slippage.   3. On the other hand~ the rigidity rapidly brings on Koflacitis to my shins if there's any extended walking involved~ basically every time I use them. Flat snow or rock is ok~ but any uphill walking turns me into a duck. Likewise~ descents are particularly uncomfortable and scary~ as I either have to take the punishment or allow the boots to throw me off balance as I step down. Experiments with lacing don't seem to help.   4. The shells started peeling after 2 seasons. Paper thin sheets @ 3x4 cm. Not so big and not cracks~ but it does cause me some concern.   If it weren't for the discomfort caused from walking I would  consider these boots again as I'm satisfied otherwise~ but I'll be looking closely at the latest single construction synthetics for next season.
221,koflach,arctis-expe,5.0,   Perfect for high altitude~ alveolite liners keep my feet warm to the top of aconcagua (22~837 feet)   hard lowers offer extreme warmth and soft uppers walk really well.  My favorite boot of all time. :)
222,scarpa,omega,5.0,   Nice boot runs narrow. Has a precise fit and just enough flex. Not too heavy for a plastic. I have an older one before the Intuition liner. I bought an aftermarket Intutition Denali liner. Love it. I have a size 12b foot and am using a 13 boot with the Denali liner and custom footbeds that I switch between my ski boots and these.   I am on the lookout for closeout new ones as mine have taken a beating but are still living. I want to prepare for the future if Scarpa decides to discontinue. I hope not. These are my fav plastics.   These boots feel like a hybrid between a real stiff leather and a full bore plastic. I wear them for ice climbing~ alpine~ and winter BP. I have commonly done 10-20 miles a day in them peak bagging in the Northeast and they have worked admirably.   Obviously not as comfy as doing 20 in a soft leather or split leather but not freezing your feet off and have a warm dry liner in the morning outweight the discomfort.   If you have a narrowish foot I highly recommend them~ fat feet people should buy with caution. Make sure you can return it.
223,scarpa,omega,5.0,   Third pair of plastics for me. Much more nimble~ plenty warm. Had read of durability problems but have two good seasons of use. Not a bad rocker for walk in~ nice and easy to get on in the frozen morning. Great fit with my Grivel crampons. The best hard shell I have seen.
224,scarpa,charmoz-pro-gtx,5.0,   Lightweight boots for spring to early fall mountaineering and hunting boots.    Pros   Cons   I hunt sheep and goat in Alaska in steep mountain terrain. I have other boots for my late hunts (October to December) which are very stiff and not made to walk flatter terrain. I bought these for my spring and summer hunts and scouting where there is a lot of rolling hills and lower level mountain terrain. They also give me solid ankle support~ packing out 80 pounds for several miles.   Because they are non-insulated~ in the spring and early fall they kept my feet warm with a pair of midweight to heavy Merino socks. In the summer~ with really light Merino socks~ it kept my feet from getting too hot. The Gore-Tex liner kept my feet dry from any showers Mother Nature sent my way!   I highly recommend these boots to anyone needing lightweight hunting or mountaineering boots!
225,scarpa,charmoz-pro-gtx,5.0,   This is a lightweight~ sturdy~ boot designed for 3-season mountaineering~ but equally at home on a rocky~ root filled hiking trail in all but the coldest weather. If you like to get off the beaten path~ this is one boot to take you there.   Pros   Cons   I bought these boots after realizing my heavy Scarpa backpacking boots just were not providing the traction I needed when scrambling up rocks. From the moment I tried them on I knew I had found a good boot. The heel cup feels solid and secure. The ankle support is excellent.   I wore them around the house for a few days before taking them out on (and off) the trail and they were worth the price. No blisters~ no tired dogs~ no wet feet~ excellent traction on rocks wet and dry: better than any boots I have owned previously. There was no break-in needed and no pressure points developed.   I did add an insole prior to wearing them~ but I do this with all my boots. I have had these boots a few months now and have well over a hundred miles on them in rain and snow~ on good trails and ice-covered peaks~ and I still think they are the best boots I have owned.   Only complaint is that~ like any waterproofed product~ breathability is not very good. I guess you cannot have everything.
226,galibier,super-rando,5.0,"   Old school perfection!   Pros   Cons   This is the ""1970's"" heavy duty backpacking boot. It has all the same quality and features you would have found on a pair purchased back then plus the best sole (Khumbu) ever made for hiking on granite and wet roots. I purchased a 46 for my 11"" long feet which are low volume and fairly narrow. I wear a US 11.5 D in most boots except White's which I am a 10.5. The toe box tapers in~ so with no insole and my foot slid forward~ there was a good 3/4"" or about a finger and wiggle room. With Superfeet and medium heavy socks~ my toes are a bit squished until laced snug.     Out of the box~ they are stiff. Expect a long break in. I couldn't quite get rid of a hot spot on one heel until I filled them with water and wore for a few hours and then pressed out the leather on the hot spot. I treat the outside with Grangers Wax and the inside with Obenauf's oil to keep the leather liner from wetting out and getting sticky with sweat.   I've had a lot of boots~ both old school (Raichle Eiger~ Limmer) and new (La Sportiva Karakorum and Makalu.) I mention these as the Super Randos are in the same weight/performance class. They have a 1/2 shank~ and once broken in~ walk very well and are preferred to the others for anything not requiring toe kicking or crampons. Ideal use is rough on/off trail or heavy work and loads.    The Super Guides are the next level~ old school mountaineering boot with a full shank for those climbing ice fields or carrying an Elk in the Rockies on loose scree. For me~ there is more than enough padding~ support~ water-resistance~ and warmth for mild winter use. They also make a two-hour trek in wet boggy trails (thinking Scotland~ Switzerland~ or Pacific NW) a lot of fun and a good work out. I purchased from Montaz Sports in France~ about an hour drive south of Geneva. They keep them in stock as of this writing.   Summary: The best all leather heavy hiking boot made. You should own a pair just because. You should also own a pair of lighter~ more breathable~ disposable boots for long distance treks that old school boots will punish you on."
227,galibier,super-rando,5.0,   Galibier boots are still available!   Pros   Cons   Do you remember Galibier boots from the 1970s and '80s? They made classic mountaineering boots~ full leather~ with Norwegian welted soles. The Vercors were very popular as a general mountaineering boot~ but were very stiff.  I had a pair of Randos which were less stiff and well suited to backpacking.    I researched them and found they are still made in France by Paraboot. The two models are the Super Guide and the Super Rando. I was able to order the Super Rando in my size~ a euro 45~ from Soodi at Pelle Line shoes in New Jersey. I paid $548 which including import duty and shipping.  I received them within three weeks and am wearing them as I write this.    They were comfortable out of the box and fit me like a custom boot. I have had Limmers and Alicos among others and these are superior in every way. My off-the-shelf Limmers didn't even come close in fit and workmanship. Sure they were expensive but I feel these are the last hiking boots I will have to buy~ and they are equivalent to custom made boots.   If you are tired of the modern Goretex lined boots which don't last and the hot sweaty feet and poor fit they incur~ then I can't recommend the Galibier Randos strongly enough. In my opinion full leather can't be beat for the kind of hiking I do in the Sierra.    If you are interested call Soodi at Pelle Line Shoes in New Jersey and she will be happy to order you a pair.  You can Google them for the number.
228,kayland,m11+,5.0,"   Figures I find what is the best boot I've owned and can't find a full line Kayland seller anywhere.      Right out of the box these are soooo...comfortable. They walk smoothly up and down hills and the rocker makes a true mountaineering boot on flat surfaces move with ease.    Pros   Cons   I would wear these all year with a different insole (the Primaloft one is overkill even for the 20 degree weather I've hiked in).   I have a pair of Vasque H2's that with the same sock combo makes for cold feet when in the 20s and 6"" of snow. I also have a pair of Kenetrek Grizzlies that trust me are warm~ but clunky at best and do not have the rigid support that the M11+s have.   I love the lace lock that allows a tight fit around the foot and loose fit around the ankle or visa versa.   I wear an 8.5 US in about everything and got these in a 9 and can easily wear a thin liner and a heavier wool sock.   Kayland appears to be a great company that puts together a quality product.   Awesome boots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
229,kayland,m11+,5.0,   Five stars! Bought them a year or so ago. I think one should write a review after you have been out there. Sometime I read reviews of over excited gear junks that come home and get their new stuff out of the box and tell that it is great.   Anyways… what to comment on? Fit? Fit on the foot? Ease of walking? Fit and crampon? Stiffness? Climbing performance? Weight? Waterproof? Durability?   How critical can you be about boots~ since every one’s last is different. They fit me as a glove.   This is a serious boot for the real stuff. Intended use: ice~ mixed and winter climbing and high alpine summer climbing~ mountaineering.   Although there is a little curve in the sole they are pretty stiff for walking~ but I find that on the walk in you can adjust the laces pretty easy due to a snap system on the instep of the shoe. The lace system is in fact quite conservative~; so it works and is reliably. It works really well and makes walking comfortable.   They are waterproof. I didn’t notice any built-up of moisture. e-vent works well in different temperatures. I use Rohner liner socks in combination with Smart Wool.   The gaiter keeps snow out. I tuck them inside my trousers~ hard shell or soft shell. (I keep the trousers down by using a bungee cord under the shoe.) The gaiters are elastic/stretchy and are not intended to give support climbing steep ice. Small but they work really well.   The laces are easy to adjust and give a lot of support to climb really steep stuff. The fit of crampons is for Grivel G20 perfect. Also hardly any built up. Even Rambo’s do fit as well as the mountaineering crampons G12 (I think?).   They are well insulated so your feet don’t get to cold on those belays where you have to wait for hours. But the “dexterity” is so to speak still there for mixed climbing.  They don’t get wet that easy as said and they dry quite well.   Weight wise they are much lighter then say La Sportiva Battura’s. The only wear I notice so far is that the reflective paint comes of the gaiter. They are not built to last forever; they are made first of all to climb steep stuff.   A really nice~ comfortable boot for not too much money. Recommended with five (5) stars. 
230,kayland,apex-plus-gtx,5.0,"   Technical insulated boot with integrated gaiter~ developed for winter mountaineering and suitable for use on ice and mixed terrains. Only removable insoles~ no inner boots.      According to my research~ the Kayland Apex Plus GTX boots proved to be a worthy companion when tackling the snowy mountains. It was appreciated for its grippy sole~ compatibility with crampons~ and efficient waterproofing. The Kayland Apex Plus GTX boots meet the expectations of mountaineers.      Pros   Cons                                 Do not walk on a fancy wood floor with these boots.   Kayland Apex Plus GTX Boots    Technical mountaineering boot with integrated gaiter~ developed for winter mountaineering and suitable for use on ice and mixed terrains. According to my research~ the Kayland Apex Plus GTX boots proved to be a worthy companion when tackling snowy mountains. It is appreciated for its grippy sole~ compatibility with crampons~ and efficient waterproofing. The Kayland Apex Plus GTX boots meets the expectations of mountaineers.   Features and Details:    These boot have built-in gaiters to keep snow and debris out. You can use the front and back top pull straps to assist putting these boots on. I was concerned that the straps would break~ but they work.   Availability:    They are on sale for $173 at Kayland USA.   I purchased these boots from Sierra Trading Post during closeouts after reading an online review by Tom Ripley on UKClimbing.com in November 2018.   Italian designed~ made in Romania © KAYLAND is a brand of M.G.M. S.P.A. - Via Trento e Trieste~ 112C - 31050 Cavasagra di Vedelago (TV) Italy - Ph +39 0423 489310 - Fax +39 0423 489291 - P.IVA   Appearance:    Black and red (grumble)   The built-in gaiter is rather unique and works.   No animal products. These are vegan. The bottoms are rubber~ kevlar~ steel; uppers are synthetic; and the liners use Gore-Tex and plastic; laces are polypropylene.   The front and back have ""ledges"" to support clip-on crampons and fancy snowshoes. They work with all types of snowshoes~ even the ones with straps. I do not think these work with skis. (I have not tried.)   The soles are Vibram Teton lugs. They will mark up a wood floor with black marks. I learned this at EMS on their fancy wood floor (duoh) ...   Weight:   Light (less heavy than the same size Lowa Alpine Ice GTX boots~ for example)   Size:   They come in men's sizes 6-14 US. According to Tom Ripley they fit his wife really good. See the pictures. (See the website for UK or EU sizes.)   I wear a men's size 8.5. I figured on ordering a size 9 and just wearing heavy wool socks. The boots sold out very fast~ so no size 9’s. Plan B: I think I purchased the last men's size 8.5 in stock. This worried me since I was ordering boots online and some of the comments were that they are small. Two weeks later...   I tried them on and they fit great!   Little to no break-in required as opposed to my classic ALICO hiking/mountaineering boots that are constructed from heavy handmade leather and required a lot of breaking in. I saw these boots on GearTrade and they are always sold out on eBay. Several US web stores have them~ but at a greater price.   Crampons:    The boots fit everything I tried them with. I went to EMS and they let me check out a LOT of crampons. These boots fit: Salewa~ CAMP~ Grivel~ Petzl~ Black Diamond. They also fit PETZL Sarken Leverlock crampons.   (They even fit my old SMC 12 points with all of the old leather straps and brass buckles. Of course these boots work on your Kahtoola MicroSpikes for walking around in the house).   Comfort:    I went for a quick walk to the US post office wearing these new boots. It's night~ pouring rain~ and only 28°F outside. These boots are warm and dry and best of all my feet don’t hurt. I plan on taking these along this winter during my winter camping season. (I'll update this review if needed.)   Water Resistance:   No leaks. Ankle deep puddles under the leaves.   Ease of Use:   The last time I purchased technical mountaineering boots was when I went on a week-long glacier walking and roping and mountain climbing class whilst on vacation in Switzerland. I purchased a pair of Koflach Ultra boots with Lowe's Foot Fangs (the only size available in Gimmelwald shops).                                   1984—Not my boots just a picture of some Foot Fangs.                                  What is it with mountain climbers and red and black?   The Koflach and Foot Fang combo were very uncomfortable. The Koflach inner boots hurt even without the Foot Fang torture devices and they stank after a week of class on the ice. I did not pursue ice climbing after that.   Experience   No fancy ice climbing nor any peak bagging yet. Plan is for winter camping. As my energy level increases and my weight decreases~ I may be persuaded to bag yet another 4000 footer in the winter."
231,kayland,apex-plus-gtx,4.5,   Looking for an inexpensive ice boot/light mountaineer boots~ this is it! Low cost~ fairly light~ and burly!   Pros   Cons   I was looking to upgrade my Koflach mountaineering double boot~ which I use to ice climb. Those boots are workhorse. I've been to the top of Mt Washington in winter~ Aconcagua~ and a lot more. I paired them with Charlet Moser (Petzl) crampons for climbing and Petzl Vasak to hike. I still used them until last year to ice climb and lead grade 4. For a few years now~ I was looking for a lighter alternative~ Koflachs weigh around 5 pounds a pair~ which strengthen me~ but have to confess that I'm getting wiser and needed to reduce my weight on some gear.   So I tried on single boots: La Sportiva Trango Tower~ La Sportiva Trango Ice Cube~ La Sportiva Nepal~ and Lowa Weisshorn GTX. The major problem~ which refrain me to get one of those pair was the price. So I started looking for cheaper (money wise) alternatives. I looked at Mammut Guide GTX~ Mammut Norwad light~ Salewa Vultur~ Asolo Eiger~ Scarpa Mont Blanc Pro GTX~ Zamberland Eiger~ Kayland Apex GTX~ and recently the new La Sportiva Trango Tower Extreme GTX.   Don't forget that my prerogative was the best buy for my money. Since La Sportiva Trango Towers were not available yet and Trango Ice Cube were a bit too tight and too expensive~ I saw on sale the Kayland Apex GTX for 200$ Canadian. So I had them shipped after reading a great review by Tom Ripley of the UKC gear.   After a month of hiking I can tell you that I made a great buy. They were comfortable after a few hikes once I dialed in the laces right. That problem was due to the fact that I have small calf. I ordered size US10 and my left foot fit almost perfectly (my right foot is slightly smaller). The counterpart is a low ankle support. I wear US10 in Asolo boot~ US10 in La Sportiva Trango~ and US9.5 in Lowa Renegade shoe.   I used them from ranging 4°c down to -17°c using a Smartwool mid hiker sock. I found them warmer when the humidity level was low. They were very good in snow and at -17°c moving my toes let them in fair condition.   I tried on my Petzl Vasak~ Charlet Moser grade 8~ and Grivel Rambo first generation crampons and the all fit like a glove.   I've not been climbing with them yet~ but I will upgrade my review when I do.   I have concern about the top rivet use to secured the eyelet which may in long term cause some hole in the fabric. Compare to the same eyelet on my Asolo boot~ the Kaylands seem to be on the rougher side which may in long term use the synthetic leather. First image Kaykand~ second Asolo eyelet.    Overall I must say that I'm very satisfied~ in term of comfort~ weight~ and price. Now they I have to be tested on ice climbing situation~ but I suspect the boot to work as well has any other brands. So I will probably upgrade my ice tools with all that money I saved.   Kayland says:   Technical boot with integrated gaiter~ developed for winter mountaineering and suitable for use on ice and mixed terrains. Extremely performing and dynamic~ this model represents the perfect balance between comfort and performance~ thanks to its advanced construction system and lightweight. Reduced volume and overall protection for this automatic crampons compatible~ fully resolable boot.   Experience   Bought it a month ago~ use it on hikes. Will upgrade the review after ice climbing.
232,salewa,raven-combi-gtx,4.0,   I have used this boot in summer 2012. The rocker was not to my liking and I wore completely through the rubber on the toe (just my stride). Since then I have tried many other lightweight boots (Salewa Condor~ Asolo Titan~ La Sportiva Glacier)~ and none have been as good.   Pros   Cons   I used this boot all of summer 2012 to climb in Germany~ Slovakia~ Poland~ Romania~ and the UK. I planned to do more technical stuff than I did~ but since I only brought one pair of boots I did some very long hikes in these.   For a mountaineering boot they hiked quite well. Did 38 km/ 2300 m elevation gain in Romania climbing Moldoveanu with these and didn't get any blisters. Did a few long days elsewhere with great results. In Romania I began wearing through the rubber on the toe of the boot sole rapidly. I think the rocker is not ideal for my stride.   The boots continued to work well~ until a lace guide bent~ and afterward another. This made the lacing less comfortable~ but still useable. Once back in the U.S. Salewa advised me to return them to backcountry.com rather than warranty them.
233,salewa,raven-combi-gtx,5.0,   Very light and stiff. No blisters as advertised. They have been waterproof in the rain and creek crossings. I use this boot for mountain hiking and mountain hunting.    Pros   Cons   One of the most comfortable boots I've worn. As soon as my foot slipped into these Salewas I knew they were for me.
234,zamberlan,4039-expert-ibex-gtx-rr,5.0,   I am a dyed in wool Galibier Super Guide man! That being said I purchased a pair of these Zamberlan Ibex boots for winter / snow use. What a boot! The Ibex has room in the toe box for wider feet and so far have been excellent  in the wet snow of Eastern Oregon.   Pros   When I needed to have a warm winter boot I have in the past worn PAC type boots~ but they never gave me the stability that I needed. I have also used my Galibiers with full coverage gaiters but this was to much a lot of the time so after many years I have stepped out of my box/comfort zone.   The first thing I looked into was how was the fit of the toe box on many different boots in the same class. After about exhausting my options a friend in Austria recommended either the Ibex by Zamberlan or the Omega by Hanwag.   I liked both boots as they were both leather~ both low keyed colors~ and both had toe room. My choice in the Ibex was due to the heel fit just a bit better than the Hanwag and was about $100 cheaper neither of which is a deal breaker but the choice was right on.   In reading the few reviews I could find on the Ibex I kept seeing the same reoccurring statement that said to size down one complete size. I contacted the Zamberlan company in their US office in Boise Idaho and asked they questioned me quite in depth asking about the type of socks~ type of use~ terrain~ size~ body type~ basic foot shape~ and other questions.    I have not received this type of help in this country in 25 years from a manufacture of any outdoor gear. In talking to them I sized down by one half size from a 42.5 or 9.5 to a 9. I use Smartwool Expeditions with a liner sock in the winter so I fill a boot quite full and in this boot the fit is real good with no hot spots or numb areas.   I have about 4 months in them so far and the only problem I have found so far is the insole is junk as in all boots so was replaced with Superfeet Orange~ and they are a little hot when the temp goes up past 25 or 30 but then that is the territory of my Galibiers so not a big deal. Crampon fit and use with these boots has been good.   I am a hard sell when it comes to boots as I am in them every day of the week unless I am horseback and these boot have no equal that I have found for winter climbing and every day use. I will update when I get more time and miles in them but if it dos'nt get colder you will have to wait a while.
235,the-north-face,verto-s6k-glacier-gtx,5.0,   Light and comfortable~ but solid boots with a full shank that take any crampons if needed.      Pros   Comfort/Ease of use:   I did what you should never do — bought these a couple of hours before a climb into pretty difficult conditions. I'm really glad I did though. We climbed up into knee to hip high fresh powder snow. Breaking trail and kicking steps was not a problem.   Due to the worse than expected conditions we never made it to the peak but my feet were never a concern. I had solid footing and could manoeuvre well~ and the S6K's never gave me any blisters or painful spots around the ankles or shins. For these type of boots the comfort out of the box kind of surprised me.   Fit:   I have narrow feet. The S6K's have a tight locking heel and a little bit wider toe box that I think works well for narrow to normal feet. I think if you have wide feet these will not work for you. The lace lock around the ankle works well to tie your foot area~ and perhaps go a bit looser up top. The soft  gaiter like top is comfortable on the calfs and shin.    Use:   On subsequent climbs in similar and some milder conditions my overall impression was that I'm very very glad I bought these. On one climb I had packed but left my crampons and was debating climbing up as the trail started steep and icy. The hard sole~ front crampon well and relatively sharp side edge of the Verto S6K~ allowed me to kick hard enough to get just that little edge I needed.    Performed very well and although it was a long hard climb~ these were really comfortable till the end. Construction and material seems rock solid but after only one season I can't say much about durability.    Overall~ light and comfortable~ but solid boots with a full shank that take any crampons if needed.      
236,montbell,alpine-cruiser-2000,5.0,"   Exceptionally light and fast alpine boots. The Japanese know a lot about snow~ and it shows in these boots. These are technical mixed-climbing boots. You could wear them almost anywhere.   Pros   Cons   These are beautiful boots resulting from a complete chance purchase. We had a family holiday booked and paid to the snow — but there was almost no snow. Anticipating a week of snow / slush / bush-walking in lieu I made a last minute decision to invest in a good pair of boots.   I walked into the Mont-bell Australian partner (Larry Adler Ski & Outdoor) at Jindabyne and they had quite a selection of boots but these caught my eye. The RRP of $299.99 AUD was discounted to $239.99 which helped.   I had never given Montbell much thought but discovered that they have been around for over 40 years (since 1975). They focus on creating high quality / lightweight outdoor clothing and equipment. Their brochures describe the ""Light & Fast™"" philosophy. They aim to do so without compromising quality~ durability or function. I can see all that in these boots. Reading the blurb I was entertained to see that the Japanese Astronaut~ Naoko Yamazaki wore Montbell clothing in the Space Shuttle.   Japan has a really rainy / cold / snowy climate so I guessed / took it on trust / that they know something about snow. Any country that gets up to 20m of snow should know a bit about snow boots.   What won me was the comfort. They were the most comfortable pair of boots that I have ever worn (new) so I bought them on the spot with zero research. Not usually my style. I have only walked 20km in them so far.   I am not quite sure what the distinction is between alpine and mountaineering boots in the Mont-bell world. Their website does not say much~ they make 12 types of mountaineering boot and two types of alpine boot. These fall into the alpine category but I really think that there is something lost in translation. From what I can work out from the limited material in English on their website and Google the key specifications are as follows.    I don't think they are insulated but it is impossible to tell without pulling them to pieces. There could be a thin layer of something in there. You don't need insulation in Australia~ it doesn't get cold enough. They do feature a nicely padded construction around the ankle.   As luck would have it~ it snowed overnight and I ended up doing very little walking in them. The lodge is about 1km from the village and I did that everyday for a couple of weeks so I have not really given them a good test yet. Perhaps next year.    They don't sell a lot of boots like this in Australia~ but for comparison purposes~ the closest boot I can find online is the The North Face Verto S4K Glacier GTX. The Outdoor Gear Lab scored them 10/10 for weight and 10/10 for hiking and I think these deserve the same score. Other very similar lightweight technical boots are the:   In the few words on their website~ Montbell say that these are suitable for mountain climbing~ trekking to huts~ and also for nimble hiking. These are mixed-climbing boots. They would not work with step-in crampons but they would certainly work with most crampons.   The design means that there is a reasonable degree of ankle flex so they have many of the waterproof benefits of mountaineering boots but the comfort of hiking boots. They are a premium boot with supreme comfort. I speculate that there must be some type of waterproof membrane but I cannot read Japanese. On mountains the toe-zone will certainly kick steps without any problems and they are stiff enough for almost any traverse.   They are pictured here with my new Kahtoola MICROspikes (there is not much snow in Australia at this time of year if any). So I took a photo across the harbour from the Sydney Opera House. I won the MICROspikes on Trailspace last month. Huge thank you to Kahtoola.    I think that the MICROspikes are a perfect match for this type of boot. Only time will tell. Will update this review when the snow starts falling which is in June in this part of the world.   When I was younger I used to trek the 10km to Blue Lake with all my ice climbing gear~ huge leather mountain boots~ often on X/C skiis. Half the time there was no ice when we got there. Bottom line is that for our climate in Oz these are a much better proposition!    To convert that to the U.S.~ I suspect that these would be a pretty good boot for anyone needing mixed hiking-climbing boots up to about 14~000 feet or so. Above that and you would need better insulation. If you are really technical you need a full-shank or plastic boots."
237,alico,new-guide,4.0,"   This is my 2nd pair of Alico boots. I have the Summits also. These boots are made in Italy and the sizes run a little narrow. I have a somewhat wide foot so I bought the extra wides and people with a normal width may opt for the medium to D width. I also found that the sizes run large. I normally wear a 9.5-10 and in both pairs of Alicos I use 9's. Sierra Trading company is where I purchased both pairs. This is an excellent company with good customer service and pretty good prices. I highly recommend them.    The Alico Guides are a great looking~ classical~ old school boot. You may recall the old Raichle leather mountaineering boots from the 60s-80s. Stiff~ heavy and those bright red laces. These Alicos are just about the same as those old Raichles. Very few of these old school heavy duty all leather boots are still being sold and you have to look around to find them nowadays. Limmer boots also come to mind but these excellent boots are very expensive.    I have hiked hundreds of miles~ done some light mountaineering and backpacked a ton since the late 70s. I would say I am mid-level in experience. I used the old style Raichles till you could no longer get them and then switched to the newer~ high tech boots that are sold today. I used these new style boots for around 7 years and I found that they have many short comings. Almost no support~ poor waterproofness~ they caused me various foot problems~ are expensive and I destroy them in a season or two. After going through a half dozen pairs of Salomon~ Merrell~ Vasqe and the like~ I decided to go back to the old style hiking boots 6 years ago and bought a set of Alico's excellent all leather Summits and I have been far happier ever since.    My Summits are still going strong but are down for a re-sole. The sturdiness of Alico's construction and their build quality is second to none. With proper care a set of Alico guides will probably last at least 5 years of hard use. Maybe I am just hard on my boots~ but I could never get a pair of the newer high tech boots with their mix of synthetic materials and glued construction to last more than a couple years. I was always having them repaired or replaced. Having to shell out the $'s every time a set went bellyup got real old. My first Raichles lasted 10 and the Alicos have just about the same design and build quality. If these Alicos are anything like my old Raichles I suspect that I will get many years of service out of them. So even though they cost a little more up front~ over the longterm I think I will be money ahead.    Another plus is that they can be re-soled for around $60~ so you can get even more value out of a pair. The foot and ankle support on the trail is fantastic. There is no comparison to the ""tennis shoe"" hiking boots sold today. This is an all leather boot. No synthetics~ no gore-tex~ no plastic. The beautiful white glove leather interior wears good under hard use and does not cause blisters~ at least for my foot. These all leather boots also breath surprisingly good. I use a liner sock with a medium to heavy wool sock to help wick moisture away and keep my foot dry and blister free. In contrast I was always getting blisters with the newer boots even though they felt great in the store. I think because the newer boots break down so quickly~ your foot starts sliding around inside them. Also despite all the claims of Gore-tex linings and other high tech fabrics~ the newer boots I have used just did not seem to breathe as well. I think these two things are what caused all the blister problems.    At nearly 7 in's tall~ along with the stiffness of the leather and the heavy lacing~ these Alicos provide excellent ankle support. Traction is good in all sorts of conditions. The Vibram soles are hard to beat although they do tend to clog up in muddy conditions. The one piece all leather uppers are very waterproof from the factory and it is easy to keep them that way. I never had any leaks or even dampness from my Raichles or Summits and I hike in the Pacific Northwest in very damp conditions.    I do a maintenance on the boots a couple times a year. First a good cleaning with a mild soap and a stiff brush~ then a good quality leather conditioner like Limmer or Obenauf's. Finally seal them with Sno-seal or NikWax. In between major cleanings I may give them a quick cleaning and spray them with a silicon water proofer and I always dry and store them properly after use. These boots are heavy~ no doubt about that. But honestly~ you get used to the weight and they feel great on the trail. The weight has never really bothered me except on a couple of long hikes of 10 miles plus. The secure planted feel of these boots and knowing your foot is properly supported and protected is worth the extra weight to me. I guess it's a tradeoff.    Do plan for a long break-in period or these boots will hurt you. I wear them around the house at first~ then outside doing routine daily activities for a few weeks. I soften them up with a good qualitly leather conditioner. If all else fails there is always the wet sock treatment~ getting the boot semi wet inside to help it soften and mold to my foot. The Alico Guides didn't need that and after a couple weeks of normal wear they feel pretty good. I plan a couple 5-mile day hikes with them and will proceed to longer hikes if they seem broken in.    Bottom line: I would have given them a 5 star except for three things~ Heavier weight~ high initial cost and the long break-in period. I do recommend to anyone looking for a sturdy~ well constructed~ classically styled boot to take a look at the Alico Guides. If you do get a set~ take the time to break them in and learn how to maintain them properly and you will have a ""real"" set of hiking boots that will serve you well for a decade or more."

I just bought these boots online from Sierra Trading Post. The laces are too short.   Recommend using OBENAUF'S and SN SEAL.   I tried them on. They are going to need some getting used to.   There's a YouTube video on how to make breaking these in easier using lots of Dr. Scholls pads.   I will edit this review after a while with my progress.   Experience   2019: two years worth of hiking—not in summer (boots got some cleaning~ put on some OBENAUF'S heavy duty Leather Preservative and SNO SEAL around the treads attaching the leather to the soles. Boots show almost no wear!)      Sierra Trading Post has them in stock Oct 2019 for $199~ free S&H."
239,alico,new-guide,5.0,   Pros   Cons   It took me a while to find a pair of new Guides. I've been using Danner Mountain Light boots for many years. I thought I understood what it meant to break in a leather boot...clearly I was wrong. It was obvious to me  from the moment I opened the box—the 7 plus pound box—that these were different.   These boots make my Danners and old Asolos feel like jogging shoes. The quality and durability is unbelievable. I use them for work and play. I basically wear them every day.   But be warned~ it took me a month to break them in properly. And the crease above the toe box was digging into the top of my toes to the point of bleeding...a problem I remedied with saddle soap~ leather lotion~ a tennis ball~ and a ratchet strap.   Since then~ I've hiked a few hundred miles and work in them everyday. I'm a land surveyor~ so my boots are part of my work. I usually walk several miles a day~ on tough terrain. 90 days after getting them~ I bought a second pair and put them in my office closet. Plan on rotating them when i finally need new soles.   I can't say enough good things about these boots. I carried 70 pounds of gear 70 miles one week~ up and down power line trails and my feet never complained. I highly recommend layering your socks.
240,alico,new-guide,1.0,   This is an old fashion boot~ which explains its classic good styling~ extraordinary build quality~ and extreme discomfort. I've put over 1000 miles on my feet this year~ and I am totally unsatisified with this shoe.    Out of the box the Alico is as stiff as a ski boot. But that is to be expected with a heavy duty boot. I did many short day hikes (around 10 miles) with these boots to loosen them up. After two months (120-150 miles) the boots continued to make my feet utterly sore. I started bringing sneakers in my pack to change into as the pain become unbrearable~ still hoping the the boots would eventually break in.    Finally~ I realised there must be a defect~ so I brought them to my local cobbler. He showed me how the sole of the boot was cut improperly and was forcing me to walk on the outside of my feet~ causing the pain I was experiencing. I had the problem corrected for $50.   This correction stopped the pain in the bottoms of my feet~ but the boot continued to rub and create blisters on the tops of my toes where the crease in the leather folds into the toe box. The boots remain unwearable.   I have finally given up on these boots. I've spent a pile of money~ and I am utterly unimpressed with the final product because as well built and attractive as the boots are~ they cause my feet pain. Please note that the other reviewers have not come to the same conclusion as me~ and it is possible that I was unlucky enough to get a lemon pair.    Nonetheless~ I can't in good faith recommend this product.   
241,alico,new-guide,5.0,   These boots are the backpacking boots on the market. Structural superiority and comfort. Old style Italian craftsmanship. A great boot for backpacking and mountaineering.   Pros   Cons   These Alico New Guide Mountaineering boots are a sensational pair of backpacking boots.   I have had them since July 2016. During that time I have hiked the complete JMT and did not have one problem. I did a 50-mile~ break-in period and never had a hot spot or blister. On the John Muir Trail they performed outstanding. Great stability on wet rocks as well as scree.     The boot fits my foot and ankle like a custom made boot worth $1~000. The construction is old school Italian with a Norwegian welt that can be resoled many times. The boot is truly waterproof. If you use a good waterproofing material like Nikwax~ then they will stay dry.   These boots have been thru water~ snow~ mud~ and rock. They work great with crampons. I have found the New Guides to be excellent companions for any serious hiker.
242,alico,new-guide,3.0,   I love these boots! I have about 500 miles on them in two years. It takes bout 100 miles to break them in and then there is always  traveling  sore spots just when you think you are through with that. Have worn them in the cold and they are good to about 20 degrees but not colder. Keep them waxed and they will stay waterproof. Great support and protection from rocks other off trail problems. The edge really well and kick great steps in hard snow without throttling your feet.    I understood they run about a half size small so I got 11 and a halves~ unfortunately~ I needed 12~ so my larger foot big toe tends to hit the end when walking down steep slopes~ bummer. Make sure you are sized right and you can't go wrong. Stick to plastic boots in super cold. 
243,alico,new-guide,4.0,   When I first got these boots in the mail and opened the box the first thing that came to mind was Frankenstein~ not because of how they look but because of the size of these boots. The boots in my opinion are beautiful~ craftsmanship is wonderful. Unfortunately they are not colorful~ besides the red laces~ they are definitely not flashy~ and chances are good that girls aren't going to be attracted banging on my door because of them. But those aren't reasons to buy these boots.    The first time I laced them up I felt like I was ready to climb the first mountain I could come across. Well that feeling drifted away as soon as I started walking in them. They are stiff~ 4x4 board stiff. My feet haven't suffered yet~ mainly my shins as the stiff leather tends to not give~ but battle my ankle as it tries to move forward. I'm not worried and I know after a few more weeks the leather will give and the problem will cease.    The lower portion is extremely comfortable~ and the toe box leaves enough room for my toes to wiggle~ well actually almost extend to a fully perpendicular position to my foot. I would definitely recommend these boots.
244,alico,new-guide,5.0,   I am a guy who dislikes polymer guns~ 4x4's with independent front axles~ work wear that isn't made by Carhartt and plastic boots. I don't care if they are old school~ that's what I am~ old school. I love leather~ nothing in the world wears~ looks~ or smells like it and these boots are leather.    Just like the clothes I wear~ these Alicos will have to be beaten into submission but will give me years of loyal service. Although I am not a mountain climber I still demand footwear that won't leave my feet cripled and isn't made in China (no offense to the Chinese). I wore these boots for hours right out of the box and my dogs never whimpered once. If you're looking for a boot that isn't fancy~ doesn't make a fashion statement~ but is built like a brick sh_t house~ then try on a pair of these Alico boots.
245,alico,new-guide,5.0,   I'd been looking at the ad for these boots at Sierra Trading Post but couldn't decide whether to spend the money for yet another ill-fitting boot that would gather dust in the closet and ultimately wind up at Salvation Army. Then I read Ron G.'s review and sizing recommendations. I too can get by with a 10 EE most of the time so knowing to order a half size larger was good information.   The boots fit well right out of the box and even though they're stiff and a bit heavy I can tell they're going to be my main footgear for the next several years. Much of my hiking is done in very rocky terrain where this level of foot protection really comes in handy.   I am not an ounce-counter so the three pound per boot weight is no big deal. Craftsmanship is important~ though~ and Alico is right up there with the best. Anyone who wants a long-term relationship with a traditional heavy hiking or light mountaineering boot would do well to spend the money for the Alico New Guide.
246,alico,new-guide,4.0,"   This is one big~ heavy~ serious~ ""old school"" boot... and at a bargain price from Sierra Trading Post.    The New Guide is very old-fashioned~ similar in design and construction to the old Fabiano mountaineering boots~ with 3mm thick waxed Perwanger leather~ a double-stitched Norwegian welt and big~ thick Vibram Montagna outsole. This boot should not be considered a ""hiking"" boot~ because for most people~ this heavy of a boot will be a liability. I'd call it a ""light mountaineering"" boot~ but it's significantly heavier than more up-to-date designs in this category. However~ this boot is a thing of beauty~ a real classic. For those who want to do some trekking like they used to do it~ here's your chance.    If you always hike trails~ even rough trails~ this boot will probably be overkill. If you are a weekend 3-season backpacker~ these boots will also probably be overkill. But if you bushwhack up and down rocky~ rugged slopes with ice~ snow~ mud~ swollen streams~ thickets~ and all manner of other obstacles~ toting a large load on your back~ you may find the New Guide to be a great budget boot. It's very supportive and protective~ and really solid.    Fit-wise~ I found that the New Guide runs small and narrow (just like the old Fabiano boots). For my 10-EE feet~ I wound up with size 10.5 Wide. The toe-box could be roomier~ but I have big toes~ so this is unlikely to be a problem for those of you with more normal feet. The boots are still a bit tight when I wear my thickest wool socks~ but I'm hoping they'll loosen up over the next year or so.    My pair weigh just a hair less than 6 lbs. That's heavy! The good news is that when I climb a snowy~ icy Catskill or Adirondack mountain in winter~ these boots keep me warm~ dry and in control at all times. My strap-on crampons fit securely and the boots fit well in my MSR Denali snowshoes. I can kick steps in frozen soil or gain leverage on slippery boulders~ no problem. I may not be running up the slopes in these heavyweights~ but given enough daylight~ I'll be sure to get there.    On my last hike~ I found that the insides of the boots got a bit moist around the welt area. I wonder if that means the welts are leaking a little? I applied some Welt Seal just in case. In any case~ my feet stayed dry and warm~ wrapped in the soft leather linings. Maybe the moisture was from sweat?   These boots are breaking in well and becoming more comfortable every time I take them out. They're bombproof rugged~ keep me warm~ dry and safe~ and they certainly do look cool in a retro sort of way. The only reason I'm taking away a star is because the New Guides are technically outmoded by today's lighter mountaineering boots. But I'm happy to wear my little pieces of history."
247,alico,new-guide,5.0,"   As my father used to joke: ""It's nice to see you get ahead -- you need one""~ which is how I felt when I was lucky enough to land these boots.  We are talking absolutely top shelf quality Italian leather cobbler craftmanship.  I'm not sure~ but I believe that these boots may be a discontinued/closeout item~ since the only U.S. place I could find them new was @ Sierra Trading. If you are lucky enough to find these either affordably new or even more affordably not too badly abused/used~ I say jump on and into them!    They are heavier and stiffer than my '92 Vasque Sundowners (newer models of which are now made in China and I do not recommend those)~ so I know the Alico New Guide Mounatineering Boots will require a somewhat longer break-in period than other more highly marketed -- as in Madison Ave.'d -- brand names.    Alico's trademark tanning process is called Perwanger -- they claim ""Perwa Leather gets waterproofed through a special tan procedure and continues to breathe."" I've honestly yet to tramp in a stream with them because I'll wear them indoors during the evenings for a couple/few weeks to set their fit~ but when I do get busy in them in my usual digs of the Cascades and Coastal ranges of the PacNW I will step w/the confidence of dry feet and great footing.   They are classified as a crampon beckoning mountaineering boot~ but are not limited to those environs~ and these days I seldom romp above the tree line favoring the more lush than sparse ecosytems. These boots are constructed to apply themselves like a hybrid (and not like the crappy bikes more dysfunctional than applicable to realities of multi-use). They are heavier than other options~ around 3lbs each or 6+lbs for the pair~ so you ounce counters will likely pass on them...to each their own~ that's better than fine since there will then be more available for us who don't mind building up our lower extremity strength.   So~ you may ask~ that is if you muster intelligible affect amidst all the salivation~ ""How the hell did you manage to find them for less than 50 clams?""  Well~ doubtless I was kissed by the fates; But I can tell you in what nightspots I found the gals:   My Sundowners were seriously scuffed by a dozen years of use~ but their leather integrity was still holding up and while their footing had failed me their barrier protection never did -- and I have to put the former slippage on the fact that they've needed a retread for a while now. But after pricing the cost of a new factory approved Vibram cover I began to think more in terms of getting new boots. Re quality my wants always exceed my means~ so I decided to begin to research the low use/used boots options.   A few different outbackers used equipment sites can be found by virtually trekking through cyberland.  There are good deals to be had~ but I have to add sadly~ they go fast and too many people seem like they are trying to pass on their poor purchase judgement to someone else~ instead of taking more of the loss they deserve and finding a good home for their stuff. So my search broadened to the likes of not so exclusively wilderness enthusiasts sites like ebay and craigslists.  Lots of time spent and I ultimately found mine on ebay with description notes like ""hubby didn't want his...never used...minor scrapes due to box wear~ etc.""  Looked to me like the boots never touched the ground~ so I watched the competion which didn't seem all that hip to the potential promise. Did the research on them~ decided to bid for them once @ auctions endgame (that's the trick~ friends -- and I'm only sharing it because those who read this deserve to know enough not to bid earlier than that~ that only pushes the prices ever upward -- a direction good for summits but not for deals).  If the guy who I overbid wasn't kicking himself~ he should.   You just have to do the legwork~ but if you're looking at this then you already know that.     Good luck and happy trails. -paul      "
248,la-sportiva,glacier,4.0,   I am a telephone lineman. I wear these boots in the fall and winter.   They are the best lineman boot that you can buy for cold weather.
249,la-sportiva,glacier,4.0,"   I have a love hate relationship with these boots.   I love how they have taken me 90 miles across Philmont. Up Slide in the Catskills. Up Little Haystack. Brunswick Mountain in Vancouver. Rocky sections of the AT. The Loyalsock. Black forest trail. Maybe 1000 miles so far. They are sweet with crampons or snowshoes.    But I hate them too. Oh the blisters and banged toes I've had in these boots. It's a constant battle to lace them just right or tune my socks to avoid pain.    I was on top of the Tooth of Time at dawn. Another hiker pointed to my boots. ""La Sportiva Glaciers~ eh?"" he said. ""How long've you had them?""   ""Three years~"" I replied.    You break them in yet?""   ""Nope.""   ""HAHA! Didn't think so.""   I figure I'll give them another few years. The lining inside the heel is completely trashed now~ but most of my problem with heel blisters stopped once the lining tore. I do agree with several posters that the ankle can't be tightened enough.    Switching to the medium Solo insoles was a definite improvement. The factory insoles were brutal.    And those little nylon eyelets? Not a problem so far. I'm on my third set of laces~ but those eyelets aren't so much as frayed. "
250,la-sportiva,glacier,5.0,   Three years later~ and they're still performing like new! I just did a section of the Ptarmigan Traverse up in the North Cascades with these guys - still the best boot I've owned.
251,la-sportiva,glacier,3.0,   These boots always start burning my feet after 4-5 hours of use. I walk the North Cascades~ primarily Mt. Baker area. Last week I climbed Baker at night using the Coleman route and had to remove them twice to ventilate my feet and change the completely wet socks on the glacier and on the summit! The boots simply contain all the moisture from sweating inside like a rubber boot. I experimented with 6 different combinations of socks during the last 2 years but have not found the solution.   The boots are durable~ have a good grip and foot support~ work well with my Grivels~ are reasonably comfortable and absolutely waterproof but again~ in my case~ the time limit is 4-5 hours even in cold weather.   Maybe Sportiva Trango or Scarpa Triolet? They have GTex.   I will be grateful for comments.      Matt  
252,la-sportiva,glacier,4.0,   These are great boots. I have a narrow~ low~ long foot and have a lot of problems with finding quality boots but these fit great. I put a hardcore pair of insoles in them and they are~ so far~ the most comfortable mountaineering boot Ive ever had. Great flat toe edge for mixed rock~ a nice tall~ but unrestrictive boot. I blew out my knee not too long ago and dropped my Norweigen welt Montrail Mazama for these lighter Gore-tex boots. Def. require a lengthy break in time as with all decent boots. Some flex~ but overall a stiff boot~would imagine they would be painful on long stretches of vertical ice...but that's what a plastic boot is for anyways...
253,la-sportiva,glacier,5.0,   Excellent boots: heavy boots for backpacking on rugged terrain -- used them daily without problems; light boots for glacier climbing -- used them with newclassic crampons; close feeling on rock/ alpine climbing; rigid enough for single day ice climbing. After two years they feel and look like new. Use heavy sock and liner.   
254,la-sportiva,glacier,5.0,   It was time to trade in my seven-year old Merrell hiking boots and I wasn't about to take the decision lightly.  I read nothing but great reviews about La Sportiva's line of hiking and mountaineering boots; the company seems to offer a different boot to fit almost any need.  When my boots arrived I couldn't beleive how compact (I was expecting huge ane heavy) and well-designed they were.    My Glacier boots formed nicely to my feet within a week and now they're ready to hit the trails. I don't remember how much I paid for my Merrells but my new boots definitely offer more support and allow my feet to breathe (I can think of nothing worse than the feeling of your feet stewing inside your footwear).    I wouldn't want to wear my La Sportiva's Glacier boots in subzero conditions but they are perfect for my needs -- day hikes and the occasional weekend backcountry trip.                  
255,la-sportiva,glacier,1.0,   These boots were a big disappointment. Virtually no support after they are broken in. They feel like a pair of converse canvas basketball shoes--if you are serious about true mountaineering these are not the boots. Skip the Makalu and go for the Eiger~ La Hotse or better yet if you can the Nepal Extremes.
256,la-sportiva,glacier,5.0,   Excellent shoe--I have used it with crampons on light glaciers (Whitney Glacier on Shasta~ Pallisade Glacier in eastern Sierra)~ as well as with the supergaiter in less technical high-angle snow. On top of that~ they worked amazingly well for hiking on the trail every day this past summer--in all~ I wore them for about 80 days of hiking and didn't get a hot spot.  Great all around boot.
257,la-sportiva,glacier,5.0,   This boot is a great all around heavy duty boot. I broke them in with a few day hikes around the Nisqually Basin Wildlife Refuge carrying my healthy three-year-old daughter in a Kelty Pack (approximately 18 miles).  Not much break-in was needed actually. The distance was more for my own training and fitness.    After treating the Glaciers with Nikwax~ I've used them for two full days on snow~ ice~ glacier~ and rock. Using full-length gaitors and Grivel G12 crampons~ I carried a moderate load of climbing equipment up some steep pitches to the summit of Mt. Hood. The descent featured a lot of postholing through mid-day slushy snow.  With not one sock change from 2:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.~ my feet still felt great.  I highly recommend these boots to a climber/hiker who wants something more versatile than plastic climbing boots.
258,la-sportiva,glacier,5.0,   These are great boots.  None of the problems associated with the lesser Makalus.  I broke these boots in for 2 months with frequent 1 mile walks.  I spent 16 days in Alaska off trail and on glacier with these boots and they were amazing.  With proper seal treatment~ these boots were absolutely waterproof in low streams and deep snow.  Plenty of rigidity for any type of terrain and a rigid enough for good kick steps.  I have narrow feet and I had 0 blisters over the entire 16 days!!  Great boot!
259,la-sportiva,trango-alp-gtx,5.0,   Over the past 16 years or so I’ve bought various boots that would fall into the UK category of ‘4 season’ (in the UK this refers to a boot that is suitable for extended periods of use with crampons~ as opposed to how well insulated it is). Mostly~ they have been disappointingly uncomfortable or not robust and stiff enough.   I bought my Trango Alps new off an eBay shop for less than half UK RRP. I think the seller must have bought them as part of bankrupt stock.   So~ they were quite a bargain. And they certainly look the part.   “This time~” I thought~ “maybe I’ve cracked it.”   I took the Alps on a peak-bagging trip to the central Highlands of Scotland in early March 2009. Beforehand~ I’d only had the opportunity to wear them to walk to work a couple of times and for a ‘family' walk with my kids (16 miles total)~ just to see if they were going to rub anywhere. They were fine~ but obviously I wasn’t using them ‘for real’.   On my trip~ I lugged a big pack into a bothy (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothy)~ where I based myself for a week~ making trips around and over the local Munros (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro). Conditions were typical for early spring up there; anything from powder snow to saturated bog underfoot~ snow~ rain and sun at various times~ very windy most of the time~ and often poor visibility on the summits.   On the day with the best weather~ I broke trail through deep drifts to the base of a ridge~ climbed it (some devious route finding to avoid steep~ very soft snow and front-pointing on snowed-up~ rocky~ frozen turf were required)~ traversed four Munros and broke trail through more snow to get back to base~ covering 16 miles in total. The other days were shorter~ but still very demanding. I covered about 85 miles over 8 days.   The Alps were excellent! Despite my feet being wet almost all the time (from water running down my legs in very wet weather early on and a river crossing later)~ they didn’t rub at all. I had one heel blister at the end of day 7~ which I know was just from sheer foot pounding (if the boot had been rubbing~ it would have burst).   They are very comfortable~ but also feel tough and are stiff enough for front-pointing.   I’m not sure that the ‘Impact Breaking system’ (IBS) sole with the extremely funky tread helps me keep control on steep~ slippery ground better than any other deep~ chunky Vibram sole~ but it certainly is a good sole unit. Some of the other boots of this type have a sole with a shallower tread and a treadless ‘friction patch’ at the front; adding to their performance on dry rock~ but definitely not as good on the messy~ muddy UK mountains as the Alp.   I assume that the jazzy~ silver synthetic leather overlays are there to help stop the Perwanger leather that forms the main shell of the boot from stretching too much over time~ but I wouldn’t be too shocked if a La Sportiva insider let on that it’s mainly eye-candy to seduce the likes of me into buying these rather pricey boots.   [Note~ 12th Feb 2014 - I've upped the rating to the full five stars because~ in the five years since I first reviewed them~ the price has stayed static (in the UK~ anyway)~ whilst competitors have continued to tweak their equivalent boots~ ratcheting the price up all the while. Also~ having talked to someone who is knowledgable about the supply chain~ from 'bull to boot'~ I have realised that now~ a 'no overlay' Alp would cost more~ because thicker leather would be required~ which is getting very expensive because of animal husbandry regulations.   So~ I have cracked it: they they have the perfect combination of comfort~ toughness and stiffness.   Addition~ 16th Mar 2014:   The Gore-Tex liner has finally gone in the right boot. That's a long time for a boot liner to last. I am now 'retiring' these boots~ as they also have very worn soles. They have served me flawlessly~ and are easily the best boots I have ever owned.   I've just bought a pair of Trango Guide EVOs~ so let's see if they live up to their predecessors.
260,la-sportiva,trango-alp-gtx,5.0,   Excellent boot~ flawless performance.   Pros   Cons   I bought these boots as an all rounder~ something to use year round and they have performed flawlessly.   I have quite narrow feet~ especially around the heels~ so La Sportiva's range have always fit me well. The Alps felt good from the box and didn't require any break-in. The lace lock is a really nice feature and allows you to vary the lace tension from the bottom and top of the boot.   There have been reviews that have mentioned these boots failing around the toe crease area. There is a toe cap that ends where the toe would bend~ but the sole is designed to rock and there is good flex in the ankle area~ so you don't actually bend your toes~ the boots don't crease in this area unless you get a bad foot placement.   I've used these boots for scrambling and winter climbing up to grade III and can't fault them~ warm enough for UK winters and light enough to use through the summer. If you have narrow feet and are after an all-rounder boot~ I would fully recommend.
261,la-sportiva,trango-alp-gtx,0.5,"   You can see my original review at the climbers shop Ambleside (and by the way this review doesn't reflect how good the shop has been~ which is great).   Let's set the record straight: these boots are rubbish. Other reviews around the world suggest they are not as waterproof as ''some other boots.'' Well~ let me assure you~ I was on my third pair. All were brilliant to start with~ very comfortable~ etc. However~ all three pairs have failed within 80 miles. The third pair failed within 10 miles.   By ""failed"" I mean soaking wet feet: not damp~ not sweaty~ soaked simply from wet grass. All have been sent back~ and all have been replaced by the shop as they have witnessed the failures. They simply crease at the toe and it acts as a squeegee.   Please don't buy these boots. They will fail.   Just for the record~ my wife uses Trangos and she loves em~ but the Alps are simply dreadful. Looks like it's back to Charmoz for me."
262,la-sportiva,trango-alp-gtx,5.0,   The previous review says it all~ but always good to get another opinion.     Firstly fit is everything~ and when I slipped on the Trango Alp in the shop it fitted like a glove~ except on my foot. I have now used the boot for a couple of walks on the mountains this winter~ and was impressed with the function and comfort~ and having just used them for 3 days mountain walking in the Scottish highlands I am now convinced that this is just the boot I need.   The boot is compact and feels very nimble for a 4 season boot~ secure~ yet not cumbersome~ and the ankle flex system is superb...with no sense of the top of the boot digging into you your lower leg - the boot just hugs your foot instead. The light weight means that stepping through deep snow was much less grueling~ and when I needed the edge on icier ground they were reassuring and solid enough.    All good stuff~ but what really impressed me was the way you feel connected with the ground. These are not big blunt boots~ but they're sensitive enough to make you feel light of foot.  May not seem a big deal~ but it makes a difference to the mountain experience.    The flex is an issue to consider. There is some confusion over whether these are B2 or B1~ but I tried on B2 boots as flexible (Scarpa Freney) and also B2 boots which were stiffer (Manta). They worked well with B2 rated crampons~ so I'd consider them a low B2 rating. The toe does flex~ and if kicking steps they are less resilient than a solid boot~ but I used my edges instead. And to be honest if you need to kick your toes in~ you should probably need your crampons on..!!  The slight flex is all gain the rest of the day~ in fact I can imagine mountain walking all year round with these boots.  Great for heeling in hard snow on decent.   A word on Goretex linings~ which this boot has. Personally I wouldn't buy a boot without one~ especially in UK winter where wet snow is as much of a boot wetter as a bog.   I can't comment on durability~ but I don't get chance to do a lot of winter stuff~ so hoping they will last many years.   In conclusion I'd thoroughly recommend~ but back to my opener~ fit is everything...and these fit me..!!
263,scarpa,charmoz-gtx,4.0,   Bought these to do the Cuilin Ridge in September (it was windy~ a bit rainy but 12 to 15 degrees Celsius).  The climbing zone on the toe provides surprisingly good adhesion when smearing and the boot is good for edging~ obviously not as dexterous as a rock boot~ and the toe does visibly wear quickly.   I wanted a sole with good grip on wet rock as previous boots with Vibram soles were like ice skates when it got wet.  Tie sole on the Charmoz is Vibram (the same as on the bright blue La Sportiva Trango) and it sticks well on wet rock and general rocky~ grassy~ muddy terrain.  I have walked up streams and through bogs~ and through torrential rain in these and had no leakage.   The only criticism I have is that they are very warm and your feet get hot - we all know how breathable Gore-tex is - about as breathable as a bin liner.  After 3 consecutive days walking and scrambling 10 hours a day (carrying pack and rack)~ my feet ached a bit~ I had small blisters on little toe (compeed sorted that)~ but feet were sweaty and getting soft~ so had to change to approach shoes after that.   They'll be a great boot for when it gets colder though.
264,scarpa,charmoz-gtx,3.0,   I bought these boots for a forthcoming Haute Route treck. They were light and I felt I could move quickly with them but the first encounter with wet conditions proved they were not waterproof at all. As can be imagined I was completely disappointed when they were returned to the shop~ but I did receive a full refund.
265,scarpa,charmoz-gtx,5.0,   I bought this boot to tackle some classic routes in the Alps. It was ideal for rock routes such as the Dent du Geant and excelled when taken up Mont Blanc~ as it is so light but still packs a lot of warmth. Very comfortable and brilliant for all but advanced alpine climbing. Some heavier B3 boots may be more versatile in that they can be used for easy-hard grades~ but the Charmoz is great for anything up to French D or Grade 4 Scottish.
266,mammut,mamook-gtx,4.5,   Used on Mt. Rainier and Hood.   Pros   Cons   I got these used from a local popular guide service. They said they were in really good shape and they came to me at about 90 percent new with one small crampon scar and some slight heel wear inside.   The insole says size 10 and the boot says 9.5~ but either way (maybe both sizes use the same insole) the sizes run a tad small. They fit me fine.   Boots advertise being light and they are~ weighing less than my old Raichle Eigers.   Tough? I have taken them on three alpine climbs so far and they don't hurt my feet and show zero wear. These accept step-in crampons and are plenty stiff with enough flex to do some hiking as well.    These boots have AMAZING lateral support and the lacing system allows you to wear some sections of the laces tighter than others as you prefer or cinch them all down tight. This feature pinches the laces and means they will wear out faster so watch those laces for wear.   I haven't gone to really cold climbs yet but I doubt they are as warm as plastics.  I have worn them down to 30 deg F.   I never got wet slogging through oatmeal-soft snow for two days at a stretch.   I would never pay full retail for these~ that's beyond my budget for anything but maybe a car. I got them at less than 40 percent retail.   Maybe not the best that $400 could buy~ but definitely the best my $150 could buy.   Update 1/15: I wore these in 2014 to the summits of Mt. Rainier and Mt Hood. Still love them.
267,asolo,aconcagua-gv,4.5,   I just found out from Asolo that these are a limited offerring NOT DISTRIBUTED IN THE USA (see my source below who suddenly listed a few all as almost gone~ but in several sizes 9.5 to 13).  Asolo Medium boots typically run on the narrow side for foot volume and heal width~ but have nice toe box size.    Pros   Cons   Little Mt Si isn't the highest point in the Western Hemisphere~ like Mt Aconcaqua.  However~ the Asolo Aconcaqua Mountaineering boots~ with its' pinnacle name~ can help me conquer almost peak in comfort and with increased safety.   Peak of Little Mt Si~ yesterday (Sunday Dec.13~ 2015) just before lunch.      Good supportive boots greatly increase a hikers' safety on challenging terrain~ such as on this rooty section of Little Mt Si.  One could say 'equipment overkill' here.  I say ... breaking ME into a newer boot awhile is never a bad idea!  And besides it makes a moderate hike even more physically challenging~ because of the extra weight on my feet = more excersize.      These boots feel like they are going to be EPIC like their namesake (Mt Aconcagua is the highest point in the Western Hemisphere).  Rating score might adjust as I know the boots better. From what I see so far~ I could have started with 5~ except due to weight. So far~ I positively love them. Comfortable right out of the box.  Easy gait walking~ invincible feel to them.  To pretest the boots~ I've worn them a few days in the office~ then tested on a few hikes so far.  Climb rocks like crazy with high stability and traction.  Excellent support~ stiff soles with some rocker~ amazing heel flexibility in walking.  Grip mud and wet leaves well.  TOUGH and DURABLE~ hard to nick the leather.  Need next to get them onto glacier approach & glacier conditions.    ________________________   Asolo Catalog Info (main Italy site)   Aconcagua GV Color: GRAFITE/NERO   BOOT CATEGORY:  Climbing   Recommended for:  Classical mountaineering~ hard trekking and Winter work.

I'm guessing that the GV means the boot has a Gore Tex lining and Vibram sole.      Astonishing match of materials and excellent attention to detail was my first impression when inspecting the boots. They feel amazingly strong and solid~ they feel like the 'Hummer' of boots.      Attractive styling is present throughout the design~ and it all for function too~ not just for show.  The black fire (bat wing?) on the upper color puts cushioning and flexibility into your climbing step. Note the double tongue inside the gussetted collar. It increases support and drastically increases comfort. Note how the rubber rand protects the front and sides of the boot~ while not displaying edges to get snagged and torn.      Contrasting artful designs display on the inner leg versus outer leg collar designs. The low key coloring with contrasting bold design make the boot very distinctive and elegantly eye grabbing.        Wonderful symmetry of color placement and balance is woven into the functional elements.      Aggressive sole patterning is highly event on these boots. This weekend the maiden voyage of the boots was on a trail with loose gravel~ mud~ and multilayered large water soaked Pacific Giant Maple leaves with ice slush and mossy rocks. These boots have a beast of a grip. I rinsed off the mud and air dried them before the photo.      Deep gnarly tread depth on this mountaineering Vibram sole.   The sole rolls up to be a protective bumper~ meeting the rubber rrand that wraps around the toe base.      Toe Rubber Rand is just wide enough to be effective and feels strong a durable.      Boot Gusset design and view of lacing eyelets and micro pulleys.      Double tongue is very wide and supportive and has Velcro to adjust how it cradles your foot.  Note the thick soft boot padding and neutral color wicking cloth surface.      Cavernous opening created by the gusseted design permits easy putting on and taking off these boots.      Boot footbed insert is shaped well and performs great.  Many complain that Asolo's inserts are a hard and Spartan experience.  I thought so two for my first many hikes in my Asolo Power Matic GV 200 boots (see Trailspace review).  First I tried gel inserts~ then Superfeet.  Overtime I discovered that Asolo's worked the best with less fatique and better support.  You'll discover what breaks in and works best for you.  Their inserts breathe well even in my Asolo Power Matic 250 boots~ where the inverts sit directly on a hard polymer footbed support.      Best lacing support system I've experienced yet for boots.      Top eyelets have a wide double riveted base~ wide clips with cut outs helping to you remove iceice and grit in use.  Also note the strong stitching~ double on load bearing areas.      Ankle eyets are strong fabric~ well anchored into the boot.  I was wondering why the heck they weren't metal until that first hike.  This design results in better flexibility action at the ankle.  These boots flex enough to be more forgiving on flat surfaces (less of a Frankenstein-like movie gait results).        Low ankle eye is locking so you can seperately tension the upper and lower boot sections.  These also help greatly in holding the laces in position as you begin to lace the upper section.          Three sets of Micro Pulleys help in quickly tensioning or releasing pressure in the lower lace area.  Classic proven dual D-rings eyelets anchor the bottom of the lace train.      Micro Pulleys work fabulously well with the strong kermantle wrapped laces provided.  If the laces need replacing on the trail~ standard 550 lb Parachord is equivalent.  Lace ends can be formed on cut exposed ends of either with careful match fire melting and spinning to a hard cap in your fingers.         Big Rocky terrain is so amazing to experience!  I prefer to kick its' butt~ rather than be kicked by it!      Anniversary hike for a couple with us on the Boulder Garden Loop section of the Little Mt Si trail.      We hike a lot tougher areas!  But heck~ this was yesterday and my feelings are still livin' it!  And so are theirs.
268,salomon,s-lab-x-alp-carbon-gtx,4.5,"   Good for three-season mountaineering from trail head to summit. Now you don't need approach shoes any more. Light is fast and fast is safer.    Pros   Cons   Review   The weight and stiffness of mountaineering boots make them something I put on with reluctance and only when absolutely needed. For instance~ to avoid wearing the big boots I hiked to Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier in Gore-Tex trail runners before donning the big boots to finish the trip. Conventional mountaineering boots are big~ clunky and too stiff for trail hiking~ making approach shoes a must.   Salomon has created a boot with the edging rigidity to work with crampons~ the flexibility to take on approach hikes~ and the lightness to get you to the top faster.   I am of the opinion that~ the less time you spend exposed to hazards the safer you are so faster equals safer. I also like the fact that I don’t need to carry another pair of approach shoes just to get to the place I can wear my big boots.    Fresh out of the box   Testing conditions   My favorite testing day we hiked up Tumwater Mountain~ outside Leavenworth~ Wash.~ while it was 22 degrees F or so~ in knee-ish deep snow and dumping more every minute. I took a day to scramble some unnamed cliffy-peaks in the mountains above Chelan~ Wash.~ in temps right around freezing. I also got to test them on Snoqualmie Pass climbing snow banks with crampons but the driving rain keep my intrepid photographer car-bound~ preventing some decent picture-ops.   It has been hard work to find deep snow here this winter (""look snow~ let's hike over there"")~ so I have had lots of opportunity to wear them on rocky peak hikes with temps in the high 30s to 40 F.     The biggest surprise was how these boots edge so well. On the scrambling day there were several times I expected to need to turn back or face a day-ending slip and tumble but the soft rubber held on to the rocks.    I'd hesitate to wear these in the teens or colder just because they are so lightweight.    Fit   I know that to me~ Salomon shoes generally run a little narrow and these do as well so I ordered a half size bigger and just got a little extra toe room along with my fit. The heel stayed with my foot and didn’t slide around~ making it better for those who tend to get blisters easily.    Like a sneaker inside   Features   The lacing system is a single-pull style to tighten the boots. The only problems with this come from what you are supposed to do if a lace breaks or is cut; you can’t go to Wal-Mart for a new set. Still~ the laces work well and do not create pressure points like round~ thick laces can.   The other issue with the lace system is that you cannot tighten one area more than the rest~ again~ not an issue for me but it's there.    The boots have an integral gaiter to keep water out and a storm cover to keep the zipper itself ice free.    The soles feature a carbon chassis to allow flex but also protect your feet from the fatigue of rocks pressing through. I found this to work especially well~ they armored my soles but let them flex too.    I wish these had a D-ring to attach the hook of gaiters to. I also wore them without gaiters; just pants with cuff cinches~ and had no issues.   I'd really like to wear these in a few months on Mount Saint Helens or this summer on Mt. Baker.    Lacing system   Comfort   I really like the feeling of these boots compared to my full size mountaineering boots~ which always leave my feet tired and slightly sore. After hiking in these through snow and over rocks I forgot they were there. Though they are stiffer than approach shoes they give the same feeling of safety and flexibility that I love from hiking in approach shoes. Ankle support is all on your own because these are essentially low top boots.    The zipper is protected from freezing.   Weight   These are advertised at 1 kg (2.2lbs) and weigh much less than my other “lightweight” mountaineering boots weigh (1000g compared to 1720g). Plastic mountaineering boots weigh over 2000g. If you are carrying less weight you can hike longer~ faster and less tired~ increasing your fun and safety.    Dry after knee-deep soft snow.   Waterproof   Though the zip-up soft shell cover is only water resistant~ the Gore-Tex lining in the boot liner does its job. I never experienced any wetness after a day in heavy~ wet snow. My feet were dry and warm.    Strap-ons worked great~ no heel lip though :(   Crampon compatibility   I had expected a lip on the heel so I could wear them with my crampons with a heel catch but no dice. Would it have killed them to mold a lip on the heel? Either way I have strap on crampons too which fit and work great with these boots. These are NOT designed for times you may have to do any front pointing so just keep that in mind. Flexible~ strap-on crampons only.    Easily sheds snow   Tread grip   My girlfriend was wearing double plastic boots and I was wearing these one day in the snow and hers kept accumulating snow in the tread~ making her really fun to watch. The Salomon boots shed snow easily and provided excellent grip. On rock they are very sticky which may sacrifice a little durability but that’s how it goes.  The soles have a slight amount of antifreeze in the compound to prevent cracking at really cold temperatures~ the kind of cold where you will probably choose a warmer boot.   No gaiters today and my feet were still happy.   Protection   Being lightweight I fully expected to feel every rock I stepped on and to hate my feet by day end. The carbon chassis underfoot however does what it is supposed to and provides great foot bed protection and edging stability. Full size mountaineering boots are much better at protecting your toes from crampons~ ice axes~ and rock impact~ but they also weigh twice as much.    Tumwater Mountain~ Leavenworth~ Wash. Immersed in snow without gaiters and still happy. It was puking snow like a college freshman pukes cheap beer this day.    Warmth   When boots weigh just 1000g you don’t expect them to be very warm~ at least not as warm as full size mountaineering boots and that is the case. Though I stayed warm enough in them I was moving during the entire test period and temps were only in the mid 20s~ which is what these are designed for.    IF YOU ARE STANDING STILL YOU DEFEAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THESE BOOTS~ so keep moving.  You will not climb Denali or Everest in these~ but that’s not their purpose. Salomon rates them to about 19 degrees F~ which seems about right.   Great grip on rock and when edging is required.   The flex is SO much nicer over rock and mixed terrain.   On the move in temps in the low 20s (F) is where these boots belong.   This day was at just below freezing in mixed terrain~ perfect for these shoes. My feet were dry and comfy all day. Updated 03/09/15   I scrambled this little peak in them. Their edging abilities are fantastic.    Update 03/30/15: I used these boots on my ascent/ski of Mount Saint Helens and loved them. Temps were in the low 30s. The light weight made the trip up nice and they stowed well for the ski down. Update 07/07/15: I summitted Rainier (14~400+ feet) in these boots and while they are not super warm I was the only one without blisters that day! Still loving them.   Trip Report: https://www.trailspace.com/forums/trip-reports/topics/169812.html#169812    Mt. RainierRainier Summit   Wearing them unzipped helps with ventilation   No need for camp shoesComfy is not a word anyone ever uses for mountaineering boots except with theseConclusion   I love the idea of faster and lighter. I wish there was a heel lip~ but I can live without one. For weekend warriors who are poaching summits~ trying to save weight and get there before rock fall becomes a hazard~ these should be seriously considered. No doubt we will see these on elite mountaineers who are looking to set speed records and such~ but I think they have a place for us mortals as well.   You probably will regret it if you try front pointing in these~ but why would you do that with strap-on crampons anyway? Three-season glaciated volcanoes~ traditional mountaineering~ and fast and light snow climbs seem to be where these boots will shine from trailhead to summit."
269,salewa,condor-evo,4.5,   Greate boot for hiking~ trekking~ and some mixed climbing. Durable~ full waterproof.   Pros   Cons   Fit: This boots fit great on feet.   Comfort: Well~ they have comfort.   Support: Perfect support for ankle.   Water Resistance: Full waterproof.   Traction: Like 4x4   Temp Control: Your foot will feel like you are at home.   Ease of Use: Very easy to put on foot.   Features: Satisfactory design.   Construction & Durability: Strong construction and good durability.   Conditions: Any time of year. Good for all outdoor activity. I prefer trekking and ice climbing.
270,salewa,condor-evo,3.5,   I had the Salewa Raven which had some durability issues. Got rid of them and got these for the beefy sole and leather upper. These are much more durable~ but they are not as easy to hike in.   Pros   Cons   The fit on these is the same as all Salewa. Medium foot volume and width. I wear a 12 in Salewa shoes and I can go either 12 or 13 in these. 12 feels short while going downhill~ 13 feels a little roomy. Wish a 12.5 were available.   I had the Salewa Raven but had issues with durability. Once they became available in the U.S. I got the Condor~ the Raven with a heavier sole and leather upper. The Condor has been very durable~ but the only difference is it doesn't hike as well as the Raven.   Overall a nice boot but I am using the Rapace now and think it will be a better option for long approaches.
271,salewa,raven-2-gtx,4.0,   Very well made~ very high quality. May not be the perfect match for every foot and ankle.   Pros   Cons   The Lamborghini of boots. Very rigid shank even though it's not steel~ provides enough flex in the  front of the foot for comfortable movement.   Top quality materials. I purchased these a few days ago after having done thorough research and trying on multiple other comparable boots. I have begun to notice~ after three days of wearing~ some slow to arise comfort issues~ primarily with the footbed design that's arch is more pronounced than what my feet are used to. I've resulted in putting flat insoles in them and am still finding the arch to be too high for my liking.   My other issue is with the excess material of the tongue being too bulky against my ankles when I snug the laces down. I have bruises from where it's putting pressure. I've tried to rearrange how it folds when tightened with no relief. I think there is simply too much material they've placed here for ease of donning and doffing. Because of this issue~ I'm unable to tighten them enough to totally snug my heel into place.   The width is more comfortable than many others I tried out. My 5th metatarsal bulges out a bit and I typically aim for wider sizes~ but these allow for the bulge more so than did the Asolo Fugitive wide size (and were also stiffer in the shank).   My other anatomical problem is skinny ankles~ which isn't helping with this boot.     It truly is a very well made boot~ but at this point I'm still uncertain if it is totally compatible with my feet. I'll be slightly bummed if this new relationship doesn't work out~ but as it stands~ a long trek in these may leave me with a lot of discomfort unless they begin softening up and my feet and ankles begin toughening up.     I purchased a size 10~ 6 foot tall~ 170 lbs.  Lamborghinis aren't necessarily for everyone...
272,asolo,makalu-gv,4.0,   A lightweight~ comfortable~ technical single-boot that works well on mixed rock and ice pitches and is quite comfortable on approaches while wearing a 3-day pack full of gear. Although they worked well on snow and rock approaches~ save them mainly for the warmer seasons and be sure to size them up a bit to be sure you have toe box room.    Pros   Cons   One of the best technical climbing boots I've used. My toes got a little cold during a standard late spring climb of Mt. Shasta~ but that is partly my fault as I didn't size up like I normally do. Found the boots used but in like new condition in a size 11 1/2...normally I would have bought them in size 12.   I use them in the warmer seasons for more technical routes where I need to pin-point my feet on narrow routes or climbs that involve more rock climbing over snow and ice climbing.
273,kayland,super-ice,4.0,"   The Kayland Super Ice boot is the newest boot in their mountaineering line that is suitable to general mountaineering~ waterfall ice climbing~ and mixed climbing. I will comment on my initial impressions of the boot since this is the first season that I have used them.     The boot is a hybrid leather/carbon fibre design that is popularized these days by LaSportiva's original Trango series. My biggest like for this style of boot is 0 break-in time. Compared to my first set of single leathers (Scarpa Cerro Torre) these boots fit perfect right out of the box with no chaffing or hot spots. Kayland markets these to a medium foot width but my E width feet felt perfect in them. EE width might be a problem that only Invernos can solve. The boot uses eVENT as a waterproof membrane which has the added effect of being a semi-vapor barrier keeping your feet toasty warm. I've worn them in -25 C weather with no cold toes (but my metabolism is high). So it sounds like a great boot~ but why only 4 stars?   The boot isn't perfect.   I firmly believe that there are ""teething problems"" with the Kayland Super Ice that the company should address immediately. The biggest peeve is the weird shaped toe welt that seems to fit only one crampon design on the market (Charlet Moser Dart). Kayland should eschew some aesthetics to make a more crampon compatible welt like the ones on Scarpa or LaSportiva boots. On the other end the rear welt fits most crampons BUT it is made of a very soft material that readily deforms should you ""misalign"" your crampon while reefing on the release. This is a clear design flaw as LaSportiva or Scarpa boots don't exhibit this so Kayland should clear it up TOUT SUIS!   Still~ despite these peeves it is the best (albeit the most expensive) boot that I have had the pleasure of stinking up."
274,mad-rock,alpinist,3.5,   First and foremost~ the pluses of this boot include their warmth and that they are fairly comfortable.   I've done a little bit of everything in them~ snowshoeing~ climbed Mount Rainier~ ice climbed.   In general these boots have done well in all of those scenarios. The one complaint I have is that they don't go well from one to the other and here is why. I lace them to fit the activity I'm doing. On the hike in to the glaciers of Rainier I left the top one or two sets of eyelets unlaced. This allowed me better walk-ability. The days we hit the glaciers~ I tied them a little higher.   When I go ice climbing in them~ I tie them all the way up and tie them tight. They performed admirably in my few experiences I climbing.   The reason I do this is because these boots are really stiff. Stiffer than my wife's La Sportiva K2s. They also don't have the ankle hinge of plastics.   So here is my complaints:   1. The metal grommets/hooks that hold the laces also shred the laces. I have not had an unfortunately time lace failure yet~ but I'm sure one will happen at the worst possible time.   2. The stiffness. It's one of those things that is arguable about whether it's a benefit or negative. I think that these boots were meant for the types of activities where a little more give would be a benefit.   3. Heavy. These boots are heavy. Period.   So here are my favorite things:   1. I've gotten on blister in all the times that I've used them~ I don't consider that so bad.   2. The price I paid ~$100 brand new from Moosejaw.   3. They've worked in every task I've asked of them. They've kept my feet warm~ dry and usually quite comfortable.   As a final thought~ I mentioned earlier my wife has the La Sportiva K2s. Those are clearly a step above the Mad Rock Alpinist in my opinion. They offer close to as much warmth. The shank seems a little less stiff but my wife outclimbed me on the ice no problem with them. However~ we paid way over $100 for the K2s so clearly it's not a perfect comparison.

276,mad-rock,alpinist,1.0,   I guess this just became the official fat-footed boot. I have fat feet too~ but would never entertain the thought of climbing any mountain with a Mad Rock product. I hear they make a great crash-pad though.
277,mad-rock,alpinist,5.0,   I've had my Mad Rock Alpinist boots for a few a months now and just got to give them a real test out on a climb up Mt. Washington~ Feb. 21 2007. Didn't take too long to break them in around home for a while first. I've got wide feet too~ and they did OK.   They were great! Kept my feet dry~ warm~ and worked great with my Petzl Spirlock crampons. I'm ready to conquer another mountain with 'em. 
278,mad-rock,alpinist,4.0,   I just got my pair. I've read that for wider feet these tend to run narrow~ but I've worn them around the house to break them in and they feel fine~ the real test will be Mt. Elbert next month.
279,koflach,clima-montana,0.0,   There was a catastrophic problem with the plastic shell of my boots which caused both to crack the third time I wore the boots. Since I was still breaking them in (they never made it to a climb) by wearing them around the house~ this was surprising. What was more surprising was that the boots continued to come apart over the next few days (the sole of one came completely off.    Later when I tried to contact Koflach customer service I was told that Koflach boots (which had been made by Atomic) were no longer being made~ and hadn't been since early 2007. I was also told that I was out of luck as far as warranty work was concerned. All told~ a bad experience. 
280,koflach,clima-montana,5.0,"   I was quite pleased with these boots.  They are my first plastic boots and I had heard horror stories of how ""plastic boots break your feet in"".  I spent some time climbing outside Durango~ Colorado~ and found these boots to be quite comforatable as well as warm.  I do however have extremely wide feet and felt after a long day of kicking steps~ that I could have used a wider boot.  But as a starving grad. student the price was right.  They also fit quite well in a pair of Atlas 1233 Snow Shoes. I recomend these boots as long as Black Dome keeps selling them for 189.00."
281,koflach,clima-montana,5.0,   Very pleased with these boots. They have been comfortable right out of the box.  Have done a couple of mild winter climbs~ and they have been excellent: comfortable on the approach and solid on more technical sections.  Upper is extremely flexible - great for French technique.  Hasn't really been cold enough to comment on warmth~ but so far my feet have been toasty.   Take your time when shopping and make sure they are the boot for you.  If they fit your feet~ I highly recommend them.
282,koflach,clima-montana,4.0,   I had a pair of last year's Clima Comprex~ the Montana is a slightly redesigned verion of the Comprex. The Comprex is maroon and yellow and the Montana is primarily purple.    I used the Comprex last season for climbing and hiking in the Whites~ they were plenty warm except for standing around on belay at Elephant Gully one COLD~ fine day last February. Anyway~ there are lots of Comprexes for sale used at places like IME~ and should prove to be a good boot for most people. I liked mine~ however~ because I have fat feet and skinny ankles~ the design of the ankle cuff proves to be a problem. When I had to crank down on the boots for climbing~ the various parts of the cuff would bind in such a way as to make the boot inflexible and painful. I tried the Montana and it has the same problem. They are great boots~ plenty warm~ great for climbing~ moderately priced~ but I had to change brands.   Skinny Ankles~ stay away from 'em.   a
283,koflach,plastic-boots,0.5,   My old Koflachs have just fallen apart today. Despite looking perfect at the start of the walk. I guess that there are changes happening in the plastic that are imperceptible.       All walkers and climbers should be aware of the risk of this in old plastic boots and I suspect that a responsible manufacturer - there is no such a thing - would warn purchasers of this. Take care out there~ I may be gone for some time.  
284,koflach,plastic-boots,5.0,   I bought it in 1980's. I use it for hiking in snow~ ride snowmobile and ice climbing. Plastic just dried out and brittle. It just happen today. I was trying to find new one. I could not find new one.    I think they don't make them anymore. I have tried look at www.koflach.com. It say website is in maintenance come back check us later. It has been like that for 2-3 years. Wonder what happen to that company. They are great shoes. They always keep me warm.
285,koflach,plastic-boots,3.0,   I purchased a pair in the '80s. Very warm and versatile.      I haven't worn them for a few years and went out today to Box Hill. The completely split apart so plastic has a life span?
286,koflach,plastic-boots,5.0,   My first plastics~ I love them! Just spent 3 days on Mt. Ranier at about 10000' training for glacier travel. These boots kept me toasty and dry and were comfortable. Wear them loose around the cuff and if they fit well there will be no problems. Koflach makes Alpine ski boots that fit my kind of foot well too (low arch~ wide forefoot~ narrow heel). Good boot!
287,koflach,vario-soft,4.0,   I have worn these boots for six years in various conditions from full-on vertical ice climbing~ backcountry (AT) skiing~ multi-day mixed climbing on Rainier~ etc.~ etc. The only hit I would give these boots is that the liners are just not as warm as others. Considering that you can get a custom~ closed-cell foam liner for around $100-150 and this may just be the best two-piece plastic boot going.
288,koflach,vario-soft,3.0,   These boots were pretty flexable for plastic boots and they fit my foot (narrow heel~ wide-ish toebox) pretty well. They have a Therminum insole~ this is the second from the bottom of the line boot sold by Koflach.  (The bottom (==least warm) is the Viva Soft.) Unfortunately~ they aren't very warm.  To keep them warm enough at -5 degrees~ I had to add a pair of insulated supergaiters.  This isn't really warm enough for the NH Whites in winter~ so I had to bring them back.   I never got a chance to hike in them~ but they were comfortable enough walking around my backyard in the snow.
289,koflach,viva-soft,2.0,   While in one piece they gave me a lot of support and protection.  they are very light for the size and purpose.  They kept my feet dry and warm when no one else had dry sox left. After many seasons and only few actual heavy uses~  these boots literally shattered when stomping the snow off them to go inside. Fortunately I was at home and not out on the field where such a failure would be a disaster.
290,koflach,viva-soft,2.0,"   Unlike the other comments on these shoes~ I had some negative experiences with these shoes. Especially the robustness of the shoes did not meet my expectations.   But to start~ first the positive side of the shoes. They are warm~ stiff enough for crampons and due to their double structure~ they dry fast (at least much faster than leather shoes). And to conclude~ they are relatively cheap.   Due to the soft inner shoes~ the break in period passed without a single blister. However~ I did have some problems with my instep. Due to the pressure and the stiffness of the shoes~ they started to ache after a few days of walking. I could solve this by tying my shoe laces somewhat different (loosely around the ankles).   The most serious problem~ however~ was the robustness of the shoes. After only five weeks of using the shoes on mixed terrain~ not only the soles were gone~ but also the nose of one of my shoes broke into two halves. It was simply cut from the little toe to the shoe laces. Probably I had hit a stone~ but in my opinion~ that should never be a problem for a mountain boot. Fortunately~ I was able to reach the normal hiking trails (by keeping the shoe together with a crampon). There I had to throw them away and continued my holidays on some old ""crampon-friendly"" leather shoes.   My brother had also bought such Koflachs. His outer shoes also suffered from severe wear of the soles. Further~ the laces of the inner shoes got detached from the shoes. The stitches simply got loose.   All together~ the shoes turn out to be not such a bargain as I initially thought..."
291,koflach,viva-soft,4.0,   I love these boots.  I cannot remember a time when my feet were seriously cold while wearing two pairs of wool socks.  (except on Denali when I don't think anything could have kept me warm)  I also have not had a single blister either.  The soles wear pretty well. They are worn down from walking on scree and moraines but not too bad.   On the other hand~ I find that moisture gets soaked up by the inner boot and the inner boots are difficult to dry.
292,koflach,viva-soft,3.0,   Good boot for the price~ if this is what you need.   I have worn my pair of Viva Softs for two seasons of tree planting~ they have served me well~ but are now dead.  It only took about 1500 hours.  Due to my experience with these boots~ and many friends who have them~ I will dispel a few myths.    One~ they are not really that heavy (plastic and foam are light materials).  Two~ they actually tend to fit wide.  They do offer a lot of ankle support~ which in the long long run is bad for your knees (knees are not meant to rotate the way your ankles do).  They are really heavy when wet~ and take a day or two (or three or four) to dry out).
293,koflach,viva-soft,3.0,   I have wide feet~ and was told these ran narrow~ and I knew I would use a heavier sock than for summer climbing - so I got two sizes bigger than my regular shoe~ and in my case they fit very well on first use.  Used them on Mt. Rainier~ and in much colder weather in the Catskills - warm feet.   On the other hand~ they are not supposed to be used for really cold weather~ and a number of people I've communicated with relay serious complaints about fitting.  If they don't fit right in the store~ don't buy them because they won't change much.  But at a recently advertised price of $190 or so (I paid $275 last year) you should try them on if you are in the market for an entry level plastic boot.
294,koflach,viva-soft,5.0,   If they fit you in the store~ these are *the* boot for winter hiking/mountaineering.   They are very warm.  Pretty stiff sole~ but you tend not to notice this as much when there is snow underfoot.  They can take strap-on crampons (what I use)~ but are probably better with step-ins.  You don't have to worry about tightening your crampon straps too much and cutting off your circulation~ because the hard plastic shell will prevent this.  Around camp you can ditch the plastic shells and sleep with the liners. Or use just the plastic shells for those late night trips outside of the tent to answer the call.     Remember~ though~ they are plastic and won't break in.  If they don't feel really comfortable in the store~ you will hate them forever. Try other brands until you find one that feels right.
295,kayland,mxt,2.5,   This boot feels and looks great in the store. I had some significant challenges after I bought it - some I could overcome~ some I could not.   In terms of fit~ you should know that the boot is narrower than it first feels. I found my toes were pretty cramped on hikes. Some of the cramping was undoubtedly exacerbated by a custom foot bed I added to the front part of the boot to moderate the slope of the heel~ which is significantly taller than the footbed. That caused crippling pressure on my arches~ until I raised the front of the footbed to match. It took my 4-5 hikes to get to a point where I didn't carry a spare pair of other boots.   I found that the sole - in particular~ the climbing zone at the front of the sole - wore out quickly. In fact~ a couple of months after buying my pair~ I had to return it to be resoled because the sole was also separating from the rand at the front. I had done some tough hiking in it~ but not really all that many miles. That was disappointing.   I also had issues with moisture. This was my first experience with eVent~ and it did not appear to be nearly as breathable as Gore Tex. Once the boot gets wet~ it stays wet for a very long time. My feet sweated worse than in Gore Tex boots I've worn.   I was also surprised by how quickly the shoelace grommets started to rust. Within the first couple of months~ all the grommets were already rusted. Still usable~ but doesn't bode well for the longevity of the boot.   I loved the red color~ I loved the easy compatibility with hybrid crampons; but I wouldn't recommend it as a rugged~ long-term boot or for people with wide feet or low arches.
296,kayland,mxt,4.5,   Great flex-rigidity ratio~ fine room in the toe box~ as light or lighter than my Sportivas~ comfortable for 8-12 miles in the Rockies or the Grand Canyon.   Pros   Cons   Excellent fit for size 7.5-8 regular foot.   No break-in needed~ no rubbing or tight/hot spots. Way comfortable~ no tired feet.   Walked through Grand Canyon sand and Rocky Mountain slush and deep cold snow~ no problem with leakage of any kind..   The platform and ankle support are superior to La Sportiva Trango..   I seam sealed the stitch holes = dry feet.   Good grip on dry and wet surfaces.   Roomy toebox allows for wiggle warming...yay!   I replaced the top 2 eyelets with speed hooks at Perry'as Boot Repair...well worth the extra $36.   My hikes are generally 8-12 miles over rough terrain~ have used them weekly x 4 weeks...so far~ so good...time will tell about durability.   => I bought these at Neptune Mountaineering in Boulder on sale as discontinued item @ about $125~ a great buy...I'd love to have another pair on deck for the 5 year replacement cycle!
297,kayland,mxt,5.0,"   I tried on several different boots and have very difficult feet to fit. My feet are wide~ with a high arch and large instep.   When I tried on the MXT's I was instantly in love so I ordered a pair on sale at Boulder Mountaineering. I was really excited to get them in the mountains until my wife noticed a faulty seam. I notified Boulder Mountaineering~ and they were great. They called the Kayland Rep~ who drop shipped a pair even before they received the returned pair.   Last weekend I took them on a 16 mile hike in ""mixed terrain"" (MXT) and they performed very well. I am considering ordering more for back-up."
298,kayland,mxt,4.0,   Great boot~ very similar to La Sportiva Trango S and Scarpa Carmoz. Of the three it would seem the MXT is built with the most durable materials. Not as light as the La Sportiva's but lighter than the Scarpa's. Out of the box they are ready to go IF they fit. The heel is narrow with a medium width at the ball of the foot. Great lacing system that works~ no fancy knots needed here. eVENT lining breathes better than any WPB I have tried. Worth a look.
299,kayland,mxt,0.0,   Bought these boots for aid climbing and mountaineering.   The performance for actual mountaineering is yet to be tested~ but I used the boots for two days while hiking at Alps in Austria. After the trip~ I noticed that the side of my big toe had gone numb~ apparently permanently. I think it was caused by a small edge inside the boot that after pressing repeatedly against the toe damaged it. I suppose you could file the edge a bit~ put some filling there~ or something.   On the positive side~ I've used the boots for aid climbing and been very satisfied. As you don't walk around much when climbing~ the toe doesn't suffer much. For this use~ the boots are really great. For via ferrata~ the soles may be too hard~ especially on metal rungs~ and the boot doesn't smear very well. Edging is of course much better than with hiking boots~ though I can't say that it's great~ as the ankle support doesn't extend as high as it does with some mountaineering / ice climbing boots. I have also tried the boot for ice climbing a bit. It's not really optimal for that as the sole is not hard enough and the tip bends a bit~ which makes front-pointing a pain~ but you can get through.   As the boot doesn't have any special locking mechanism for the laces and as they are round and therefore rather slippery~ you need to use proper lock lacing.   I don't like the red color. The old version and the women's version are more decent colors.   Had to buy a bit bigger shoe than I normally buy.   No matter how great boots are otherwise~ permanent nerve damage gives them zero stars. If it wasn't for that problem~ the boot would be 4-5 stars for its multi-purpose use for mixed hiking and climbing.
300,aku,zenith-leather,4.5,   This model is discontinued~ I can't find them anywhere. Very comfortable.    Pros   Cons   Updated 6/2018: I bought mine for $130 on Sierra Trading Post. I have crossed streams etc. after reading the negative reviews here~ and had no waterproof issues. I never put anything on them either. Maybe Akus manufacturing is inconsistent.   I love the leather interior lining~ because it doesn't pick up burrs or other organic splintery things like fabrics do. The outsole is made more like a cross/runner~ and seems to wear fast. I would prefer some substantial lugs on the sole.   The regular price is a bit much for how long they lasted me. But I wore them almost daily for a year. They are rather lightweight~ comfortable. I wear them all day at work/construction and after. I want to get them resoled~ but AKU may not be supported well in the United States.
301,aku,zenith-leather,4.0,   Just bought a pair of AKU ZENUTH II LTR (March 25 2011).   I pick those because they were leather~ didn't want GoreTex (too hot for me).   Have only walk 5km~ but I think I will love them. I have a pair of ASOLO TPS 535 and I really try to break them~ but the weight is my problem.   Well~ will give these AKU a good try because I'm going to Guatemala in July and need a good pair of boots~ will write more after a few more km around 50km+.
302,aku,zenith-leather,0.0,   Same thing happened to me: after 30 minutes of rain my feet were swimming in them even though the boots were impregnated with water resistant spray before.
303,aku,zenith-leather,5.0,   Bought these boots for a camping trip to the Rockies last week~ and wore them every day no matter what we were doing. Probably logged 150 km's on them~ and I don't have a single blister. Made a few stream crossings and my feet were bone dry. The soles gripped even the slippery rocks. I love them and I hope they last me many years.   Update: June 18~ 2009   I am updating the previous review~ which I wrote last August. I have now had the boots 10 months so have a bit more experience with them.    I still love them. They have held up extraordinarily well and still look almost new~ though I wear them on regular day hikes. This past New Year's Day~ I wore them to hike along the frozen river at the bottom of Maligne Canyon in Jasper National Park. Though I went without ice cleats~ I did not slip once. My feet were comfortably warm the entire hike (though I admit that may have something to do with the merino wool socks I was wearing!)    I used water-proofing on the boots before wearing them the first time~ that I think everyone is expected to do before wearing leather boots. It is even recommended on the box. I've worn them during rainstorms and for river crossings~ and my feet have stayed bone dry. I think I have resprayed them once as well~ and will do so again before our next big hike (10 days!!!) in July.
304,aku,zenith-leather,1.0,   Bought this boot for wet weather~ had walked less than 1 mile and my feet were soaking.  Returned them to the shop~ and was given a bottle of Nikwax.   I e-mailed AKU direct and once it was established I was in Scotland they did not return my e-mails~ even after I said I would write to every blog I could.   I am disgusted~ the boots are useless to me.
305,asolo,titan-gv,4.0,   Muy buenas botas~ comodas y con buen soporte~ las use en un ascenso al lanin con bastante nieve y no se pasaron.   Pablo
306,asolo,titan-gv,3.0,   Having read the earlier reviews about the Titan falling apart I bought them at REI to ensure I could take them back but was initially pretty pleased with them. Had used them for about 10 mountain days (longer than some listed below)~ mostly on snow~ and they held up well.   However~ one week into guiding with them~ using them everyday and often step-kicking into scree~ snow and ice a quarter-sized hole opened up in the rubber toe~ exposing the yellow nylon fabric underneath. Repair hasn't stemmed the widening hole and although they are still waterproof and the nylon has held up so far~ I can't imagine it will hold for much longer.    Unfortunate that they couldn't stand up to normal mountain environments for more than a couple weeks of use because I really liked them. Maybe Asolo will beef up the toe on future boots.
307,asolo,titan-gv,4.0,   I bought the Titan from REI because the La Sportiva Trango S did not fit. I've had past problems with Asolo products~ but took the chance. I've used the boot for 15 or so days of rugged mountaineering~ including the Redbout High Route/Ruta Lake High Route last year in a low snow year. The boots are the most comfortable mountaineering boots that I've owned in 20+ years of climbing~ and they perform very well on all surfaces~ i.e.~ snow~ w/crampons~ scree~ steep heather~ 3-4 class rock. So far~ they are holding up well~ but time will tell.   Update: April 23~ 2007   UPDATE to original post.   I have now used the Asolo Titan GV for roughly 50 full days of mountaineering~ and the boots have performed and held up quite well despite some abusive travel and notwithstanding others' experience with failures. I screwed and cemented a supergaiter on the boots~ and they have become my early season mountaineering boots. (I'm using the Scarpa Escape GTX for late season mountaineering). The Titans have been the best all around boot I have used in my 20+ years of mountaineering. Perhaps I've been luckier than others.
308,asolo,titan-gv,3.0,   The most comfortable mountaineering boot I have ever owned. But~ they fell apart after only 4-5 weekends of typical use. I went back to REI (where I had purchased them) and they gave me another pair. That pair also fell apart after 4-5 weekends.    So~ I called Asolo and they told me that they had discovered that boots were failing in the field and had re-designed it slightly. They gave me one of the newly re-designed pairs and it has lasted a whole season so far. If it lasts another 1-2 seasons I'll call the whole experience a sucess. But~ if not~ I'm going back to REI to get my money back!   
309,asolo,titan-gv,1.0,   The boots fell apart after only nine days use. Asolo called it pre-mature wear out. When I took them back to the retailer another person had the boots for two days only and they started to fall apart. Don't waste your money on this boot or any other Asolo product.
310,la-sportiva,trango-prime,2.0,   I am a lifetime La Sportiva loyalist~ however~ the Trango Prime fell short on performance in my opinion.    This spring on an attempt on the Liberty Ridge~ Rainier I spent three days in this light~ tough~ comfortable~ yet stiff boot. The problems began a few short hours after beginning my approach up the snow field. To sum up the trip in two words “Wet Feet.”    I will say that conditions were untypical maritime soggy snow pack and wetter than usual. I am also aware that the EVO’s are Gore-Tex and more suited for wet(ish) conditions. Yet for the price and being described as a technical mix boot for longer approaches I assumed that these types of approaches would include snow. The Prime was wet within hours of my feet hitting snow.    I would like to preface this by stating that I am an X professional mountaineering guide who has years of experience in this type of conditions in Southeastern Alaska and I know how to keep dry…these skills were a lost cause on the Trango Prime. The Primaloft liner was impossible to dry and actually took better than 3 days to dry in my home back in Colorado.    I would run the EVO’s with a light overboot if you needed that added warmth as the Prime will do you little to no good once wet…which they will be.   
311,la-sportiva,trango-prime,0.5,   I couldn't agree more with Billie Prescott - these boots are NOT waterproof. During a 5 day trip of the Bernese Oberland I had a similar experience. My toes were squelching in water after a day in deepish snow.  The upper parts of the boots and my socks were fine~ (so no seepage through the top - due to the GORETEX gaiters) but I had to wring out the lower ends of my socks when I arrived at the mountain hut.  (Embarrassingly~ I was the only one who had to do this).   I believe the materials used may be ok 'in theory' (e.g. when immersed in a bucket of water) but in the field they simply just don't work.  I have never had this problem with other boots.
312,la-sportiva,trango-prime,4.0,   Great mountaineering boot with option for automatic crampons. Is great for ice climbing and mix climbing in mountains.    Pros   Cons   I was choosing between these and some other heavier models but decided for this one on recommendation from my friends.    It fits my feet great and is very comfortable.   I used these boots in different snow conditions and never got them wet inside.    Temp control is main disadvantage of this boots in my opinon~ but if you are not planning to use them in very cold weather it should be fine. At lest it works for me.   They are also quite trendy so I use them on snowy days for school.   I have used them for two winters now.
313,la-sportiva,trango-prime,4.0,   Pros   I've used these boots three times on day hikes and temps were 10-35 degrees with snowshoes and Microspikes. Before I used the boots Sno Seal was put on the leather and stitching~ no water came through while going through ankle high streams a few times~ I had snowshoes and OR gaiters~ so I can't comment on the integrated gaiters.    
314,mammut,monolith-gtx,2.0,"   Light~ precise Goretex and leather boot for hillwalking~ scrambling~ and crampon use in easy summer alpine or Scottish winter. My right boot began to leak noticeably though. Returned for refund. Initially awarded 5* — amended to 2*.   Pros   Cons   I bought these as replacements for a venerable pair of Meindl Nepal Pros as my ""do-everything"" boot for hillwalking in Ireland~ Scottish winter walks~ and moderate snow/ice/mixed climbing. They will take strap-on or hybrid (toe basket and clip heel) crampons.   I was initially considering the newer Meindl Himalaya and tried these on as a alternative~ as Mammut have a reputation for a narrow fit at the ankle~ which I need. The fit and comfort were noticable~ as was the markedly lighter weight compared to my old boots. Despite their stiff sole~ the pronounced rocker in the sole gives a very easy~ natural stride when walking.   Other than removing the stock insoles and putting in my Black Superfeet~ I wore these straight out of the box on what ended up as a 22km hike~ which may not have been the best approach to breaking the boots in!   Apart from a little playing around with the lacing en-route to lock down my heels and eliminate an annoying rubbing by the left ankle cuff~ I had no issues with comfort on their maiden voyage~ albeit the terrain was reasonably gentle (mainly boggy tracks and rough mountain paths). No blisters or hot spots at all~ which was great.   The sole had good grip on wet and greasy rock and  the boots felt very nimble when climbing or descending rocky sections.   Looking forward now to giving them an outing on more testing terrain~ but the omens are good.   As a fabric and leather hybrid boot I doubt they will last as long as my old Meindls though. They also would not be warm enough for winter alpine or high altitude.   UPDATE 2/2017   Although these boots continued to be very comfortable~ the right boot began leaking badly during the first year. Returned to Mammut and was refunded (this model was out of production) :-("
315,meindl,makalu-gtx,2.0,"   Makalu Pro 3000 Gtx...I paid the hefty price for these boots after being recommended them from the dealer for a 15-month trip around the world. I was pretty stoked with how comfortable they were and didn't need to break them in at all. However~ during my trip I am disappointed to say they only lasted a mere seven months!!! I calculated the time I actually used the boots for various treks and came up with approximately 22 days used with a heavy bag trekking and 21 days of light trekking.    My sole was worn at the toe to the point of wearing out the stiff plastic it is attached to. The heel rand was beginning to tear from the bottom and I wound up having to unstitch the Meindl logo tags from the tongue as they were wearing into the boot lining! The boots are far too stiff for the inadequate thickness of the rubber that tapers at the toe. The rest of the tread was fine having barely worn at all. This uneven wear is due to Meindl's exclusive design of the Vibram ""Multigriff"" sole. These soles compromise durability for a smoother walking motion~ a trade-off I found inadequate.    I traded them off during a quick stop at home to do the remainder of my trip in South America for five months with my older Raichle boots. They handled 38 days of rigorous trekking in the Andes and still are ready to hike without a sole replacement. This after using them two years prior to the trip!    My main problem is the outfitter I bought them from who represents Meindl here in Canada does not sympathize with me and won't compensate me duly. I cannot stomach paying $90 Cdn plus for a resole when they didn't even last my entire trip! (especially considering it was his outfit's recommendation for my trip!) He offered to fix the other problems~ but this doesn't satisfy me. Funny thing is when after the trip I took them back to the dealer I noticed a pair of old Meindls on display. They were donated by a satisfied customer who owned them for 20 years or so requiring four resolings and now they were showing the same wear at the toe as my boots if not even more as the owner had neglected yet another resoling and they were worn well into the leather at the toe!!!    Anyways~ if money and maintenance are not a problem~ go with Meindl. If you want a boot that lasts~ go with another brand. In looking for a pair of serious mountaineering boots~ make sure you consider the sole design; is the sole adequate~ especially at the toe~ for the stiffness of the boot? "
316,meindl,makalu-gtx,2.0,   Just picked up my second pair of these boots and have to say they are better than before~ if that's possible.   The Makalu is a boot that can be worn straight out of the box as they are extremely comfortable. The soles and shank are STIFF but do wear in and become a part of you. The higher ankle support does cause a few small sore spots when you first get these boots but that vanishes with a bit of wear.    These boots are simply THE BEST for mountain walking and I use them for hunting in the hills and rocky country near home. They are brilliant. The Gore-Tex liner is waterproof but can be a little hot at times. They are all the same. You cannot go wrong with these boots~ BRILLIANT.    Update: October 18~ 2010   I have had the Makalus for about 2 years now and they are extremely comfortable and have been on some long extended expeditions. Trouble is now the heels have collapsed and the soles are starting to lift. They have been well looked after but they soles are shot.   The uppers have got another ten years left in them.   My complaint is that Meindl treat you with ignore and the Australian/New Zealand agent Stager Sports don't even bother to answer their e mails. So for after-sales service and assistance don't bother with these boots as when they fail you are on your own.   On my last trip to the Himalayas I heard three similar stories from Meindl wearers and they have vowed never to buy another pair for this exact reason. Clean up your act~ Meindl~  you have lost another fan.
317,salomon,pro-ice,5.0,   I have used the same pair of Salomon Pro Ice boots for over 10 years now~ for Scottish winter climbing and summer alpine climbing. I have found them to be absolutely superb~ to the point where I don't really think about them when I'm using them - the sign that a piece of kit is doing it's job~ in my opinion.   The toe of the boots are becoming rounded after years of climbing rock in them and I may need to replace them. One of the few pieces of gear I have actually worn out through years of heavy use. A wonderful boot and I hope they still make them.  The lacing system stands up to tough use; I've gone through about 15 pairs of laces with these boots and the eyes / hooks show no sign of wear at all.   I wore them for years without the plastic tongue reinforcers as well and they seemed to work well. I've taken to using them now.
318,salomon,pro-ice,5.0,"   I was just getting into ice climbing last season and couldn't stand renting gear anymore. Got a pair of ""used"" Pro Ice on bBay for $100. Could NOT believe the deal I got!! These suckers were BRAND new! And though they're a size larger than I normally wear I LOVE THEM!!!!   I've hiked~ snowshoed~ climbed ice and drank beer in these guys with NOTHING but happy feet!!!!   UPDATE 12/14: I still love these boots~ but I am disappointed in their lack of traction for the approach to ice. I have to throw on some kind of device or walking's a pain."
319,salomon,pro-ice,4.0,   These boots are light and requires no break-in period. I put them on fresh out of the box in the mountains of Indian Himalaya. Though it was meant for ice-climbing~ I used them as general mountaineering boots. I subject them to front-pointing~ side-edging~ glisading or just walking~ no problem at all. Only complaint is that you need to nikwax (waterproof) them. I got my feet wet in the slushy afternoon snow.             Update: October 8~ 2005   I saw the other climber wearing these supposingly ice-climbing boots to 5430m peak without any complaint. While I had to drag my heavy Salomon Pro-Thermics all the way up to the summit. I think I will leave my Pro-Thermics home and bring my Pro Ice next time if I were to climb peaks of 5000m - 6000m.   
320,salomon,pro-ice,5.0,   These are the most comfortable boots I've owned. I've had La Sportiva~ Rachelie and Zamberlain and nothing has come close. I've used them several times already and no blisters yet.   The ankle flexibility is great and they have a wide toe box~ perfect for my D width size 12s. They are the lightest full shank boot I've used and they are quite warm. I haven't had them out in -20 C weather yet but they feel as warm as anything I've used.   The plastic tongue inserts are amazing when you finally get them in. They can be a bit of a bother on the side of a hill and they are not comfortable to leave in all the time. The boots are fully functional without the inserts. I've led Alberta Grade 4 without the inserts and they are great.   I love these boots!
321,vasque,kodiak,5.0,   These are more comfortable than most of my tennis shoes! I wish I could find another pair.
322,vasque,kodiak,5.0,   I am a surveyor who wears boots every day and the Kodiak are the best boot I have ever had. I was able to get 28 months use out these boots before the soles were slick~ nothing wrong with the uppers. Wish I could find another pair.
323,vasque,kodiak,5.0,   Awesome boots. I took them up Rainier~ and didn't get cold or wet feet. I've used them mountaineering all over the Cascades (some of the wettest mountains around) and have never gotten wet feet. They work much better than plastic boots. I have found they work great with the Black Diamond Sabretooth crampons. Overall~ the best boot I have ever owned.
324,vasque,kodiak,4.0,   I have had these boots for over two years now~ and they are still almost as stiff as the day I bought them. The wide size is still narrow in the toe~ but this does help in technical climbing. There is very little flex~ because the sole and the leather are very stiff. The metal eyelets do not allow for speed lacing~ which gets annoying. The 360 degree rubber rand makes these boots bombproof. Fully crampon-compatible~ all leather mountaineering boot is great for heavy backpacking~ off-trail bushwacking~ general mountaineering~ and kicking steps in snow. They do not have GORE-TEX~ but I have not had leak yet. Overall~ great boot. 
325,raichle,60-degree,5.0,   Bought mine on-line from Cotswold outdoor 2 years ago for £110. Because I bought them on-line I never got to try them on first but I got lucky and they fit great and are very comfortable for such a heavy boot.   As a member of a Mountain Rescue team I wear these boots a lot in tough conditions and they have never let water in. The support is excellent and due to the extremely aggressive and deep tread you feel nothing through the sole.    The insole lacks a bit of padding but this can be solved by fitting a replacement but be aware that Sorbathanes raise your heel too much and this affects the fit. I chose to stick with the original insole after trying several replacements.   Some adverts state that these are a B2 boot but they are not. Use a flexible crampon.   I am tempted to buy another pair while they are available although mine still have years left in them.   Excellent all rounder if you don't mind a heavy boot.
326,raichle,60-degree,5.0,   These boots are great. They were comfortable from the start...when I went on a five-day trip after only wearing them around the house. They're extremely durable and waterproof and my feet have never gotten cold in them. They work wonderful with crampons.     I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about these boots. I've had them for a year and a half and other than a little dirt around the edges~ they could be new. They're obviously winter boots and are way too warm for anything spring or summer~ but they're perfect for any sort of winter hiking.   By the way~ I'm a small woman and they seem relatively light...not nearly as heavy as some I tried.
327,raichle,60-degree,4.5,   These boots retails for over $200~ but I found them at a consignment store almost unused for $55. I've never had mountaineering boots before~ so I found them to be an extremely stiff boot. Unlike plastic based mountaineering boots~ there is some flex to them~ plus I think they'll soften up a bit once I wear them in.     The boot seems to be incredibly supportive in the heal and there is very little or no lateral flex. It almost feels like a ski boot to some degree~ but much more comfort. The boot offers great waterproof protection from the rubberized band around the boot. The suede uppers are fairly thick and offer plenty of insulation for winter use. Because of this~ the boots may be a tad warm in the summer time. We'll see.     The soles on them are very rugged and thick. I can't ever see myself wearing out the soles anytime in the next century...   The boots are also design to accommodate crampons~ but I'm not sure if it will fit all universal brands.  
328,la-sportiva,k2,5.0,   Bought these from a place in Jackson after stumbling around the Tetons in flimsy boots for a week. Though they took a bit to break in (like wearing them daily for a month or so for a few hours at a time)~ they are probably the most comfortable footwear I now own -- except maybe my running shoes.   They've held up remarkably well in all conditions: rough granite~ scree~ snow~ hard/steep snow & crampon~ mud~ water/ice~ snowshoe use and just about everything short of extended expidition use (which I have not done).    My feet are narrow~ so these fit very well. I needed a pair of Superfeet inserts/insoles to fit me better~ as the arch in the liners was inadequate. They are best waterproofed with the new Nikwax brush on with water stuff (sounds wrong to wet a boot first and *then* apply the waterproofing but it's the best system I've ever used. Beats Sno-Seal all to bits.)   For a looser~ more comfortable fit when on easy trail or carrying a light load~ I leave the top two lace hooks vacant. For demanding terrain~ I lace them tight~ as I'm an ankle-blower. Never sprained one wearing these.    Sold my friends on them as well as my wife (who bought the lower version~ Makalu~ I believe). My friends who climb 14ers obsessively say these hold up MUCH better than any other boot they've thrashed (tried).   I highly recommend them for  narrow-foot~ heavy use minded person.
329,la-sportiva,k2,5.0,"   Upper: 3.1 mm Idro-Perwanger Leather    Lining: Cambrelle 300   Sole: Vibram Clusaz Sole w/Rubber Toe Cap   Insole: Mtnflex w/2 mm Full Steel Shank   Weight: 4 lbs. 6 oz/pair (41)   Sizes: 36-47.5~ including half sizes   (specs copied from http://www.sportiva.com/)   I weigh 250lbs and carry up to 70lbs. for extended periods.  For me~ the boot weight is inconsequential but lighter~ less stong hikers may find them overkill for all but the most demanding terrain.  The higher cut provides plenty of support - reassuring when the total load on my feet and ankles is well in excess of 300lbs on rough ground.     I went for ""fit first"" and this was the result for my feet after comparing to Soloman~ Asolo~ Vasque~ and even Merrel (I own several Merrel products for 'urban trekking' and cannot praise them enough).  The lace-lock is positive and the fully gussetted tongue makes creek crossing a treat (read 'Aqueous Nik-Wax').  I swapped the adequate factory insole for some thick Merrell ones and modified my sock system accordingly.  The cambrelle lining is an improvment over the calfskin in my retired Meindl's.  The feel is the same (through socks) with the added benefit of moisture wicking.  There's plenty of room for toes while my ankle is cupped securely and there is no cutting across my high arches.  In other words~ I have a perfect fit.   As my K2's are red~ I make a bold fashion statement on the trail - I'm told that there's a brown/tan version but I never saw them in my size.  Mud is the great equalizer for those momentarily dissuaded by something as trivial as colour.  I~ for one~ think red is cool.   On a final note~ the service from Sportiva USA was excellent during my research and the folks at Coast Mountain Sports in Vancouver BC were extremely helpful during the selection process."
330,la-sportiva,k2,5.0,   These boots are excellent for anything~ well almost anything. I have had my pair of K2's for three years and counting.  I have used them to climb fourteeners~ grade 5 ice~ and hiked well over 100 miles in them with no problems.  They require sno-seal.  They do get cold below -15 degrees~ so if you are planning on those kinds of temperatures do not buy them.     For crampons I highly recommend the Lowe/Camp Footfangs.  Not only because of their amazing rigidity but because of the options you can get with them.  Remember to try the toe bails they come with because in most cases those are not the correct bails for the K2's.
331,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,4.0,   A fantastic boot that still works well into the future of mountaineering~ ice climbing and mixed climbing..etc. The SM 8 and 9 boots are good all-around climbing boots with versatility and comfort. I wear a size 11 or 11 1/2 US street shoe. For mountaineering boots~ I size up by 1/2 size up or a full size up. These boots I'm reviewing are size 12.   Pros   Cons   Every time I see a pair of these boots for sale somewhere~ I buy them to save as another spare set because I like them so much. I have regular to semi-wide feet and the Super Mountain 8 and 9 series boots tend to have the room my feet need for good fitment and circulation during extended climbing trips.   These have worked fantastic as all-around mountaineering and mixed climbing boot. The shank is stiff enough for vertical ice...they have front and rear welts for step-in technical crampons (work great with BD SS Cyborgs)~ enough insulation to wear just with a liner sock and a Smartwool Mountaineer sock for 14'ers in spring~ summer and light winter months. Add a Superfeet or other brand footbed to get more comfort.
332,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,4.5,   Excellent boot. If you can get them they are worth it.   Pros   Cons   I have used these boots in all conditions for the last 20 years and find them to be a very rugged boot.   I am trying to find another pair as I have worn mine out. If anyone has a pair they are willing to part with in a size 11 or 12 let me know.
333,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,5.0,   A superb ice climbing single boot for a day out on the ice.   Pros   Cons   I have climbed in these boots for the past five years. They fit my feet perfectly but did take quite a bit of break in on the heels. They have held up incredibly well. Have added a Super Gaiter for added warm in the very cold White Mountains of NH.    These continue to be my go-to pure ice climbing boots. Not too bad to hike in (approach on snow to climbs) but not hiking boots. These boots are made for ice climbing. Super stiff with great ankle support. Can spend hours on my frontpoints.   
334,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,5.0,   This boot is the shit for steep Ouray Ice. Good ankle roll for French technique. Plenty stiff for frontpointing. Warm enough for Canada but probably not Denali. Holds the heel well on long approaches. It does have a lot larger footprint than the Nepal Tops for an equal size~ but I love the way it climbs. If you're not an ice climber buy the one step down Super Mtn. 9's. They are a better all around boot.
335,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,5.0,   Love them!  I've used them for glacier travel~ low angle ice~ rock~ snowshoeing~ and hiking.  Rainier in summer and several Colorado 14ers in winter and my feet have always been comfy and warm.  My feet have never blistered in these boots and have never been wet.  Salomon's water proofing is exceptional.   I have slightly wide and very flat feet.  The factory soles work fine and the internal lacing system locks my feet in snug.   The only wierd thing about these boots is that the tungs are different lengths!?  They don't effect fit or comfort~ but the left tung is about an inch longer than the right - no big deal I guess (just a factory mess-up).
336,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,5.0,   These boots rule. I had some 101s (plastic) and these are SO much more comfortable and preform better.  I have climbed hard on these for a season and a half and they are holding up great.  They are warmer than Nepal Tops and work just as well on mixed stuff -- much more sensitive and flexible than plastic. Completly waterproof.  I'll use these for all ice unless it's way below zero. (most~ if not all~ people climbing steep ice/mixed are using rigid crampons)
337,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,4.0,"   Having used my Super 9 Guides for about 6 months~ I've got a few observations I haven't seen in other reviews: of these boots:   - It takes me a whole lot longer to break in boots than others.  Could be the shape of my foot~ but I would not take these on a trip without having worn them for a month and gotten all of the fiddling out of the way.   - The soft~ sticky sole is great on Alpine rock.  The toe areas also don't have the big gaps common on the vibram soled boots.  This is also a big help on rock.  The down side to soft sole is wear -- mine are going to need to be resoled soon.  Also~ due to the lack of ""gaps"" in the toe~ these boots don't kick steps quite as well as vibram soled boots.   - Although quite stiff out of the box~ the soles are developing some flexibility.  I have big feet (size 12) so perhaps this has something to do with it.   - I've bent the lace rollers/eyelets grovelling around on mixed climbs~ but they haven't broken yet.  Still~ I'm a little concerned about them.   Overall these are excellent boots.  The uppers are hardly marked~ they have stayed dry on prolonged use on glaciers and they climb rock and ice well.  I like em."
338,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,4.0,   I purchased these boots for an Expedition Seminar on Mount Rainier and have thus far been very pleased.  It took a couple of weeks to get them broken in but they were comfortable from the start.  The lacing system is outstanding as it allows the inner liner of the boot to wrap around your foot.  They are not as warm as I would have liked but for relatively warm weather climbs they perform great.  They kept my feet dry through several days of walking through slush and performed well on vertical ice. It is a great boot if you are not planning on very cold conditions.
339,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,4.0,   Pleased with the overall workmanship of the boot inside and out.  Typical high-quality Salomon product as is to be expected.  My only concern thus far is the fit in the heel area.  I am finding that there is minimal cushioning behind the heel (between your foot and the hard plastic counter).  As a result my heels are feeling alot of pressure while going up steep inclines...  This has resulted in blisters each time I have used them (even with moleskin...).  I like the rest of boot so much I have not given up and will attempt a few more hikes to loosen them up.
340,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,5.0,   I really dislike heavy~ clunky plastic boots~ but want a boot that can handle technical stuff.  This boot held up to the test for almost a week on Mt. Rainier.  It's a comfortable boot~ and comes with gizmos that allow you to vary the lace tensions on different parts of the boot (which is helpful~ although actually stopping to adjust the tensions during a climb is something I rarely take the time to stop and do).   The boot behaves well on all surfaces up to and including verticle ice.  Although it's about as stiff as leather boots come~ it's still not quite stiff enough to perform as well as the high-end plastics on the verticle stuff (though using rigid crampons would certainly enhance performance).   After five days in wet snow~ the boots got a bit wet~ but the plastics did~ too.  Overall~ a great boot that I'd recommend highly.  My only problem so far is that it eats through laces like mad (including 4mm spectra).
341,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,5.0,   I just got these boots~ and used them for a few days of ice recently.  They are a great ice climbing boot. Very stiff (much more so than my old Nepal Tops).  This means that they are less comfortable for walking in~ but better for climbing.  Despite their stiffness and being out of the box~ they were quite comfortable and I'm sure with a few more trips will be very comfy.  The inside is quite cushy.  The quality appears to be quite good.
342,salomon,super-mountain-9-guide,4.0,   I recently purchased a pair of Salomon Super Mountain 9 Guide boots. I intend to use these boots primarily for extended winter outings with 70 lb. packs and mountaineering. I also plan to explore the boots compatibility with randonnee bindings for backcountry transportation and fun.    I have not had a chance to put the boots through their paces in the field. However~ I can say that I am very impressed with their feel~ workmanship and innovation. This initial opinion helped forge my decision to purchase the boots.    The boot gives good~ overall support without creating pressure points on the ankle. The heel is held in place without the usual~ annoying hugging abound the Achilles tendon that I have found on many other mountaineering boots~ such as the Vasque Alpine.   Salomon employs a double lacing system enabling one to tweak and customize the degree of pressure around the foot. The inner boot automatically cinches when the tongue is pulled into place by gently pulling on a tab-loop on the boot’s tongue. The greater the pull~ the greater the tightening action on the inner boot. However~ not much tightening is required~ as the outer boot lacing system augments the inner boot’s pressure. The outer lacing system provides uniform support around the entire ankle~ without yanking the laces. ......just a slight tug is all that is needed for the desired effect.   I was impressed with the cushioning/dampening effect of the boot while walking on smooth~ rough and jagged surfaces. The outer sole provides a feeling of an air cushion~ and the inner foot bed re-affirms this cushioning sensation as well. However~ never was the cushioning so great that I lost feeling for nuances of the underlying terrain. I was particularly impressed with the lively character of the boot when walking. Although the sole does not appear to be rockered nearly as much as other boots~ I was bewildered how Salomon was able to achieve such a lively characteristic without a more extreme rocker. None-the-less~ it works well and walking in them is a cinch. While the boot seems bulky in appearance~ they in fact feel light on the foot. I also found the sole material to be very “grippy” on dry and wet rock.   Since I just purchased the boots~ I cannot attest to the their durability and usability under all conditions~ However~ my initial reaction is very positive~ as I think this boot may prove to be the all-around~ all-purpose mountaineering boot we dream about~ assuming the boot’s last design works well for one’s foot shape. I recently heard from someone who just returned from Chamonix this summer~ and he told me that many of the guides there are using the boot....a fairly good endorsement.
343,la-sportiva,k3,4.0,   I got these boots after trying lots (dozens?) of different makes trying to fit my feet.  These are great on my narrow-heeled feet.  No break in period whatsoever (compared with previous similar grade boots which butchered my feet)...12+ hour days with heavy pack straight out of the box.  They have a stiff shank but do have some flex in the toes.  I use CM-12 crampons with heel bail and ?lanier at front.  Not great for lots of steep ice but works well for general climbing.   I am not as as good as I should be with waterproofing these and have had wet feet a couple of times after a few days.  The insulation seems to work well anyhow.
344,la-sportiva,k3,4.0,   I already have the Makulus which I love but I was worried about wearing them out and I found these for only 65 dollars and they were hardly worn. They are a half size larger than my Makulus (La Sportiva) and with thinsalite lining they are probably a better winter boot. Except I notice a flaw in that the tongue of boot slides down into the toe area and cramps the toe.. which is probably why the previous owner unloaded them. My Makulu has a velcro connection between outer top leather and the inner tongue to prevent the tongue from being forced into the toe box.. but this boot didn't have that. What to do? I just used a glob of seamsealer to glue inner tongue at its most extended to the flap of leather in the outer beneith the laces and it dried overnight with bunched up sock to hold them in place and the boot is comfortable again.    Great boot except for the tongue issue above and maybe just a smidgen larger than needed but with two pairs of sock no issue. Has crampon grooves fore and aft which also fit an Alpine Touring binding (Silvrettas)~ and surprizingly even my Voile tele binding for very mild skiing. Actually was very comfortable as an adhoc ski boot but just don't do anything too steep or fast in them. Much more comfortable than a tele boot. And for snowshoeing. A good all around boot... which stays dry if submerged in roaring spring runnoff creek crossings esp. after a couple of nikwax treatments.    Looking for boots in an area where a lot of people hike and climb look for a resale shop where consignment sales are made and also returned goods from particularly La Sportive heavy boots dissatisfied customers... who just couldn't survive the longer breakin period that the La Sportive big boots usually require.
345,la-sportiva,k3,5.0,   These boots kick ass when it really counts- high altitude~ ice~ rock and mixed.  They are super light for what they can put up with~ yet are solid all-round mountaineering boots.  Warmer than hell too.  I did get a little frosbite climbing Long's in winter~ but that was because I forgot gaiters~ and they filled w/ snow.     I have heard people say that the K3's aren't as stiff as they should be~ but I think they are fine- they are very responsive~ and give a great feel for the rock or ice when climbing.  I have the old model~ without the Clusaz sole and roller eyelets.  Although the new model looks sweet~ the performance differrence is probably very little.  Break in period is a little long~ but once broken in~ these puppies are a pair of high-altitude bedroom slippers.
346,la-sportiva,k3,5.0,   It took me awhile too break these in my K3s.  Mainly my left foot developed hot spots on the back (of course it's slightly smaller than my right).  On my 5th backpack up Mt Blanca they did me very well.  It was extremely cold at night and in the morning (-20 f) but my feet stayed toasty warm as long as I was moving.  In camp I loosened them up and they were much warmer as long as I was not kneeling in the snow with the toes on ice.  The roller ball eyelets and the locking eyelets have never frozen up.  They are very sturdy and work well with my Black Diamond Sabretooth crampons. I've never had any disappointment in snow or on rock... Would I buy these again... absolutely!    But I don't think I can wear them out...
347,la-sportiva,k3,4.0,   If you are looking for a  leather single boot for winter use that provides adequate stiffness~ warmth~  and is easy to put on~ the K3 is worth every penny. I would prefer a stiffer sole~ but that's because I remember the Super Guide era boots. For high altitude hunting in tough conditions~ I think the only boot to beat this would be the Nepal Extreme~ although I prefer the newer Clusaz pattern sole on the K3 for it's design and toughness. Also~ LaSportiva USA has manged to get some size 14's (Euro 48's) out of the Italians~ which has made my life easier.
348,la-sportiva,k3,5.0,   Have used these boots on various winter trips to New Yorks Adirondack mountains and a week long summit trip to Mount Rainier Washington. Boots are supposed to have some sort of gore-tex type lining which so far has worked superbly. Insulation is thinsulate~ and I am very impressed with how warm they are~ obviously when climbing or hiking with a heavy pack every boot is warm but these stay snuggly even standing around camp (as long as your body is warm).    Stiffness is perfect for any winter (ie:snow or ice) hiking and climbing~ I do not climb verticle Ice but have been on severely steep snowfields and they work great. I use Charlet Moser blackice rapidfix bail type crampons and have had no problems with them. Fit wise they are ok~ nice toe room~ but slightly too much heel slip for my narrow heel~ (I have never had a boot that did not give me some heel problems however) I must lace them tight on top to keep my heel in place. They have a nice ankle hinge which is important when climbing steep snow or glaciers as it allows you to vary your step technique without ankle strain. Overall I would rate these boots very highly.
349,la-sportiva,k3,4.0,   First~ these are ice climbing boots and I haven't taken them out for that yet. It's basically a rather heavy full shank boot that works well with step-in crampons I have a sort of love/dislike relationship with these boots. Other than the recommendation not to buy them if they don't fit your feet... here are the major points.   1) Fit. It took me some time to get used to them. Before I realized that I needed to lace them up to the very top on the non-technical parts of the approaches I got some pretty inhuman blisters. Once I figured out that (and had a hundred miles or so to work them in) they have been perfect.     2) Stiffness: The model I have has a rather thick full steel shank (the current ones have backed off a bit in this regard - composite?). For edging they work surprisingly well~ even with a pack on. As far as friction climbing goes~ they can be problematic. When I'm climbing I have to lace them down all the way so that I have enough ankle movement. You can learn to climb rather decently with them~ but because you have so little feel it really does take some getting used to. Of course on snow they kick steps wonderfully - though I've found that they tire me less on flats if I shuffle my feet some rather than lifting them every step (they're heavy~ especially when wet). I've top roped to 5.8 and lead to 5.5 (probably could do better) with them so there's nothing that can't be worked around - it just takes practice and...faith. In general~ though~ I wouldn't buy them as a first climbing boot - we'll see how they work in ice climbing at the end of the summer.... Basically~ I know many people who get the K3's and K2's and realize that it's overkill for what they want to do (mountaineering rock climbing & rock climbing approaches).   3) Water-proofness: OK. If you are out in the snow for more than a day at a time the water will eventually work it's way through the leather. I've have better luck with mine than other people I know because I apply Nik-Wax religiously (along with cleaning my boots). The best way to do it seems to be to rub the Nubuck with a brush while under water so that you can wet it. Then apply the Nik-Wax. Mine are now~ after many applications~ pretty water tight. Not plastic boots~ but~ then again~ they're not plastics either (a site more comfortable in my very limited experience). The other problem is that they take a long time to dry out. The local cobler suggests taking out the liners and packing them with crumpled newspapers~ then changing that twice per day. I stick a hair drier on low and set it in the ankle of the boot for 15 - 20 minutes. Do this two days in a row or once in the evening when you get back~ then again in the morning. If you are trying to dry them out on the route~ well~ I've never succeeded. Then again I climb in the Cascades.   Overall~ I think that they would be just the thing for mixed routes. They kick steps well~ they take step-in crampons. They climb low class 5 with packs well~ except that the sole is too stiff to mold to the rock much on steep slabs~ though perhaps not as bad as plastics. I wouldn't get them for general backpacking~ and you can find boots that double as better climbing boots. They are definitely a pair of boots with their strengths and weaknesses. If you like their strong points I recommend them.
350,la-sportiva,k3,5.0,   The K3's were the end result of my exhaustive serch for a boot that not only climbed ice/mixed terrain well but was comfortable for the often long slogs required for backcounty climbing.  I usually eshew high tech mumble jumbo but I must confess that the carbon fiber midsole lends the boot the best blend of stiffness required for crampons with enough flex to be comfortable for extended hikes of any boot I've worn.     I am now in my third season with the K3 and can testify that it wears very well.  Regular waterproofing (twice a season) has kept all but the wettest spring climbs on the outside.  The thinsulate lining aids in warmth but I have found that below 10 F I need full gators to keep my toes comfy.  I will definately purchase another pair when these wear out.  Let's hope Sportiva doesn't change the line by then.
351,la-sportiva,k3,5.0,   The best boots we've found!  They are light enough to wear for summer and winter hiking~ and after waterproofing them~ they are terrific for stream crossing/etc. Very nice of crampooning. Highly recommend them!
352,la-sportiva,nuptse,5.0,   After hiking for years with old-school leather hiking boots in winter~ it was time for a change. No amount of thick double socks kept my feet warm so I invested in these boots. What a difference! It took a few tries to get the size right~ but after the process of elimination and some trial walking~ these boots fit perfectly!   They are comfortable with no rubbing and the quality of workmanship is outstanding. There is an inner bootie and an outer shell. The outer shell is stiff enough to work with crampons~ but flexible enough that you can walk fairly normally. The only problem I had~ La Sportiva already considered~ which was lacing them up: the stiff-ish shell resists tightening the laces when you're putting them on~ but luckily the lace hooks have a special design that doesn't let the laces back out once you tighten them. Problem solved (after you muscle the laces to the desired tightness).    My friend uses boots shell boots with skiboot style hook fasteners~ but I prefer laces so chose this boot. They are ready for crampons~ and kept my feet absolutely toasty in deep snow. Snow rolls off and water never gets in since they have a plastic shell.  Still~ my feet never got 'moist'. The inner boot is nicely breathable. Got stuck in a snowstorm and ended up hiking several hours back out with no foot complaints. I love 'em!
353,la-sportiva,nuptse,5.0,   These boots are great fitting and allow you to bend just enough in the ancle so you stay in control but are very comfortable. Great traction and crampons hold very well also. They fit like gloves as all La Sportiva boots do.
354,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,4.5,   I purchased the Lowa Civetta GTX Extremes in 2004. I take a U.S. size 15~ so I didn't have much choice in the matter — at the time Lowa was the only manufacturer making boots this big. Nevertheless~ I'm pretty happy with them.   I wear a polypropylene liner sock~ a vapor barrier sock over that (actually oven roasting bags — the manufactured nylon VBLs tend to bunch at your toes)~ a heavyweight mountaineering sock over the VBL~ the liners~ these shells~ and when it's really high / cold~ a pair of 40 Below Purple Haze overboots. This way~ the heavy socks stay dry and warm~ and at the end of each climbing day I dry out my feet~ powder them and put fresh liners on~ and then dry the used liners and inverted VBL in my sleeping bag at night. The heavy socks stay bone dry~ and so very warm.   I think you do need to be careful about securing your gaiters quite snugly to these boots - loose snow seems to easily find its way through the top if you're careless about this.  I wear either an OR Crocodile gaiter or the 40 Below overboots - with the overboots on~ these are ridiculously warm~ which makes sense as the closed-cell neoprene expands with altitude~ but even lower down~ I have used these boots without the overboots in extremely cold conditions without ever having cold toes. I hear that some people who have had cold toes have had luck with replacing the stock liner with a pair of Intuition Denali liners - I have yet to come across a negative review for the Intuitions~ but I have not tried a pair myself.   As far as climbing performance~ they are not an ultralight boot~ but have relatively low toe box volume so placements don't feel too clunky. They front point and edge well~ and if your feet are small enough that you can find a Silvretta binding to fit (my 15's are too large for this)~ I hear that these boots are one of the better ones for ski approaches and descents without carrying an additional pair of AT boots~ provided they are tightly secured.
355,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,4.0,   I got these boots at an amazing price and am extremely happy with them. They aren't super warm~ but I used them in the Adirondacks of New York for a week (spending nights inside a cabin) during February. What they lack in super warmth they make up for in super comfort. These boots required no break in and they were great for snowshoeing and hiking. I think with toe warmer pads these would work anywhere.
356,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,5.0,"   Another incredible product from LOWA.   Pros   Cons   I've been looking for this boots for years for their warmth~ construction~ crampon compatibility. With this I've found all of the above. This boot is warm and indestructible~ it wears well and I've had ""no"" break-in period.   I train at Mount Washington~ N.H.~ and I need extremely warm items and this fits the bill. Hopefully I'll be able to test them in Nepal in Spring 2016. Also~ I have the Grivel G20 crampon and I've had no problems with the step-in's."
357,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,5.0,   I've worn these up Mount Baker~ Mount Adams~ and Mount Rainier mostly traveling on glaciers~ but also a bit of vertical ice. They are outstanding - comfortable on long approach hikes~ very stable~ fit well~ and warm in weather down to zero degrees. I'll never own another brand.
358,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,4.0,   Stiff boot~ still breaking them in.  Got hot spot on base of toe after a 7 mile shoeshoe hike.  Great for ice.
359,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,5.0,   Best damn boots ever.  If you have low volume~ medium width feet~ and are in need of a great everything boot~ this is the boot for you.  They're awesome...never heard a complaint from anybody.  Stiff enough for sustained vertical~ and never a hotspot while hiking in.
360,lowa,civetta-gtx-extreme,5.0,   These boots  KICK BUTT!  They are light~ fit right~ not too tight.  The linners have gore-tex so they will dry quickly overnight in your sleeping bag.  They are well worth the expense~ but that's just my opinion.
361,vasque,alpine-gtx,4.5,   Great boot. I have owned these boots for a year now and took them to Gannet Peak. The break in period only took a couple of week wearing around town and on short day hikes.    My feet were dry~ and warm on summit day. No blisters although a little bit of a rub on the heals. They are a whole lot lighter and more comfortable than the hard shell boots I have rented in the past. I used crampons on these boots and they performed nicely. Vasque boots tend to run a little narrow.
362,vasque,alpine-gtx,4.5,   My first mountaineering boot. Comfortable right from the start and in no time felt like a part of my foot. Performed well keeping my feet dry and warm on long days cramponing~ and light and sticky during rock climbing. Thumbs up!
363,vasque,alpine-gtx,5.0,   I have been climbing for a long time. I have always had to go through a painful break-in period with new boots. This has changed with these boots. These are the most comfortable boots (out of the box) I have purchased. I will have to see how they do for the long-term endurance.
364,vasque,alpine-gtx,2.0,   Not sure what to say about this boot.  I've had a tough time with it.  Love Vasque.  Have a pair of Clarion IIs that are 12 years old and a 10-year-old pair of sundowners with more than 400 trail miles on them and going strong.  Had high expectations for the alpine but had trouble with the fit right away.  They're quite a stiff boot~ and in my opinion~ even Vasque wides run narrow.  Bought TWO pairs~ gave one away settled on 8 Wide.  Just got back from Gila wilderness in NM~ where I had bilateral heel blisters by mile 3 which progressed to hamburger feet covered with blisters for the rest of the 20-mile trip despite unlacing the top.  Could barely walk by the end.  Granted~ may be due to failure to double-sock~ or to slightly imperfect fit~ but beware:  this boot is VERY STIFF and unforgiving~ and if you're just going to be backpacking~ even with a heavy pack~ you probably don't want this boot.  Its stiffness and failure to flex puts lots of stress on the contact points of the heel and ball of the foot.  That said~ it is EXTREMELY WELL MADE as you would expect from vasque~ and I'm sure that if I ever break it in and can make it work that I'll have it 10-15 years from now.
365,vasque,alpine-gtx,5.0,   Wanted a tough leather mountaineering boot that would keep me warm~ dry~ and stable and boy did I get it!     They should issue these boots in the armed services.  I have always been a big fan of Vasque as I had a pair back in the mid eighties that I wore like slippers...just couldn't wear them out.  These remind me of them.     My first outing I went up a 10~500 foot Southern California peak loaded with 2 feet of snow half way up~ and I had only worn them 1 time at home.  I will admit that they hurt a little in the back heal I think because I didn't have the right combo of socks on..however~ I was expecting few more blisters.  They were great for kicking snow steps and my foot stayed dry and the same temp all the time.  I was very pleased for a first time outing.  I was suprised at how dry my foot stayed considering it was in cold melting snow a lot.     Heading up Mount Whitney in a week so I should be able to give them a real test in the mountains with crampons.     One thing to keep in mind...don't buy them if you want a tennis shoe like feel from a mountaineering boot because they are stiff and tough with a more than normal break-in period.
366,vasque,alpine-gtx,5.0,   I am a converted believer in gore-tex boots!  These boots worked like a dream.  It took a couple of days to break them in (mostly worn in house and office and on walks) but now they fit and flex better than any boot I have owned. They have a full length steel shank intagrated into the polyethlene insole. This means that they can take a step-in crampon and also provide excellent protection against stone bruising.  They handled my Lowe Foot-Fangs with no problem and never popped of once (unlike previous boots I have owned).  The best part is how dry I stayed spending 5 hours climbing in snow!  The leather looked wet on the outside but my feet were dry and tosty on the inside!  I would recommend this boot to anyone!
367,salomon,sm-expert,5.0,   I got this in the sale at Cotswolds and never have I got a better bargain! They are super comfortable and warm and my crampons fitted perfectly.   Easy to get on and off and have a sweet rocking motion as you walk. 
368,salomon,sm-expert,4.0,   I bought these boots for winter mountaineering after a truly painful experience with double plastic boots sent me in search of an alternative. The SM Experts have been great. I have wide feet~ and they have fit me well. My feet have not been cold at 0 degrees F (though I tend to run warm). Lovely balance between stiffness in the sole and flexibility at the ankle~ making it good for general mountaineering and snowshoeing. Rock solid fit with Grivel G-12 and G-14 crampons.     One star taken off because Salomon~ for some unfathomable reason~ did not put in a Gore-tex liner~ or some other waterproofing technology (not that I mind Nikwaxing~ but for boots you know are going to be out on the snow...)~ but I highly recommend these boots
369,salomon,sm-expert,4.0,"   I am returning mine because the toe box is just narrow enough to make it uncomfortable. I may try a full size larger than my street~ but that may prove too big. Have not taken them out~ but they sure feel warm~ and the sole is very stiff: I can easily stay on a 1/2"" edge.    They are 4 lb 14 oz--heavier than any non-insulated boots but lighter than plastics. The reason why some would not recommend them for above 5000m or extreme colds is that (a) they are not waterproof and (b) you can't take the liners off and put them in your sleeping bag to prevent their freezing. They say you can mitigate (a) with supergaiters or overboots and (b) with vapor-barrier liners."
370,salomon,sm-expert,5.0,   This is a great all around mountaineering boot. I have use it for ice climbing in the White Mountains~ summitting Mont-Blanc and even when snowshoeing on cold January days in the Laurentians Mountains. I would like to wear these boots for high altitude mountaineering (5000m plus) but experts often recommend a plastic boot with a removable bootie. What is the reason for this?
371,salomon,sm-expert,5.0,   This is a great general mountaineering boot. I would definitely recommend it. The sizing is true to fit.
372,scarpa,alpha,4.5,   Warm~ stiff~ and light for a double boot.   Pros   Cons   Sadly no longer made~ but these boots are exceptional and can be bought at bargain prices these days. I've led up to WI4 with no trouble and I'm sure a more experienced ice climber could climb much harder than that with these.   Also took these to the Tien Shan twice and had no complaints about warmth~ comfort~ or climbing ability. Only went to 5100m but I reckon these would do 6000m and beyond pretty comfortably.   Kept up with my friend's swanky lightweight La Sportiva Supergaiter boots (I forget what kind~ but they were expensive) on icefalls and with Scarpa Phantom 6000s in the Tien Shan no problem.   Only trouble is the plastic outer isn't waterproof above the tongue~ so it'll flood into the outer boot easily. It's also rather difficult to lace up really tight.   In short~ if you see them going cheap~ buy them! You won't regret it.
373,scarpa,alpha,4.0,   A solid performer. Great on a snowy approach and great for technical pitches of ice and rock. They have a low ankle collar to allow for gymnastic moves. I don't use them very often due to it being a warmer climate where I go for alpine climbing trips~ but when I do use them~ I'm satisfied.    Pros   Cons   Scarpa Alphas work well for all conditions but the most extreme cold. They work well with most crampon types and are lightweight for a double boot.   They seem to fit at the indicated size. I have a medium wide foot and they seem to fit fine width-wise. My street shoe size is 11.5~ however~ I was able to wear size 11 US men's Scarpa Alpha boots just fine with no issues.   The Scarpa Alphas I have are size 11 and they are comfortable when wearing a liner sock and mid-weight insulation sock based on a person who may have a regular feet to slightly wide feet.   These boots are good to go for cold season climbs and colder summer climbing in lots of mushy wet snow during approach hikes and low angle mountaineering.
374,scarpa,alpha,5.0,   The Scarpa Alpha~ an amazing double plastic boot. Thanks to its plastic outer shell and carbon fiber footbed~ it's incredibly light~ (at 900 grams!) actually one of the~ if not the~ lightest mountaineering boots on the market.    And considering it has much better insulation and is much warmer than any other lightweight shoes~ it's really worth it's 5 star rating. And it's amazingly warm~ thanks to the thick insulated inner shoe~ making it well suited for alpine winter climbing or high altitude expeditions.    Its sole is as stiff as concrete~ and together with its toe and heel bail it's perfectly suited for any type of crampon~ from lightweight flexible walking crampons to fully rigid technical ice climbing crampons.    On top of all of this~ I was even actually that incredibly lucky that they were on a bargain~ from 320 Euro for an incredible 75 Euro! Obviously I bought me a pair straight away~ they are now an addition to my Koflach Verticals~ both plastics.
375,scarpa,alpha,4.0,   Great boot~ very warm and dry. Automatic crampon compatible. The only problem I have is tightening them really tight. I got them on sale for $200--great buy for that price.
376,scarpa,super-manta-m4,3.0,   If you like to go on a few mountain hikes a year~ it's a great boot~ I'd give 'em the old five star rating. Fantastic stickiness on the lovely AK granite. Beautiful leather with pretty good water resistance (Nikwax paste is critical).     However~ if you seriously use yer boots~ prepare for the crappy soles to delaminate...frighteningly fast (8 months). Get 'em resoled with an older M3 sole. These are quite a bit tougher. In addition~ the lace loops in the ankle WILL rip out. Oh yeah~ one more thing. Carry the old speedy stitcher as the stitched on the heel will start to pop after a while.   In short SCARPA should have never stopped making the Bergell...they lasted 8 years and I miss them.
377,scarpa,super-manta-m4,5.0,   This bot is awesome!  I've used them since the early spring of 2003 and LOVED them.  When I got em I went on a ski mountaineering day trip only with a few blisters (to be expected).  These boots have incredable water repellency after slogging 10 miles in spring conditions.  Very good ankle protection in scree~ boulder fields~ jumps.  These boots dampen alot of pounding.  Only down side is lacing (finding right fit~ abrasiveness of laces)~ and a little weight.  Once you start hiking for about an hour~ you barley nocti it though.  Overall~ i'd buy em again~ no doubt
378,scarpa,super-manta-m4,5.0,   Alright~ this review is to set the record straight about this boot.    This boot is for Heavy Backpacking and Light Mountaineering~ period!  That is why they have the M4 crampon compatable sole~ 3mm leather~ and a full shank. If you want a boot for casual trail walking~ moderate backpacking~ or flat trails Do Not Buy This Boot!    This is a great boot~ extremely well made~ and very supportive.  Scarpa (Black Diamond) C.S. is outstanding they helped me through every process of fitting these boots via e-mail.   Please I beg of anyone in the market for a new boot~ shop and buy within your activity range and don't give a boot a bad review if you are not using it for its intended purpose.
379,scarpa,super-manta-m4,5.0,   I purchased these boots back in December after waiting for the new updated model to arrive at the local mountaineering shops. Being that I have been climbing with older Italian classic boots such as Pivetta 8's and Galibier SG's~ I didn't know how I would like the new types of boots.     Know what?  I absolutely love the new M-4's a whole lot!  In the past~ I have suffered with vicious heel blisters while breaking in new pairs of mountaineering boots.  With the Scarpas~ the break-in period hasn't been too much of a problem at all.  Granted~ I am using state of the art Smartwool Liners coupled with Bridgedale Trekker socks.  Nevertheless~ after four months and approximately 200 miles~ I can easily go five to ten miles without any blisters at all.  I have a slight rough spot on the top of my ankles~ even with the generous padding.  I believe that one of the lacing grommets is rubbing me a bit there.  I'm hoping that as the uppers further break in~ this slight discomfort will go away.     All in all~ these Scarpas are everything I had hoped for in a boot.  The boot securely cradles my feet and they feel totally protected.  One optional accessory that I added was the SofSole Athlete's Cushioning insole and these make my feet feel fine as well.  There's enough room in the boot for this cushy insole and I removed the standard Scarpa insole and put this into my recently resoled pair of Pivetta 8's. I'll be taking the Scarpas for some spring climbing with crampons soon as from what I've heard~ the Scarpas perform equally flawlessly with step in crampons.  The M-4's are definitely recommended for people who want a stiffer boot without paying the price of the usual harshness of a stiff boot.
380,asolo,expert-gv,4.5,   I have owned my Asolo GVs for several years. I would buy them again if given the opportunity.    My use includes regularly hauling packs weighing in excess of 60 pounds~ on and off trail~ three season mountaineering applications~ limited technical and snow travel.   These boots meets most of my expectations; they are light for their duty rating~ suitable for heavy hauling on or off trail. The sole is stiff and protects your soles well~ due to a shank~ so a rocker sole is incorporated into the design. Good support through the ankle section too.  The boot heel and toe have a rubber scuff bumper that protects the uppers from rock cuts while negotiating rough terrain.    They are well crafted and comfortable~ like most of the Asolo product line. While not comfy as slippers~ they are easy enough on the dogs that I use them as in-camp lounge wear~ in lieu of hauling camp foot wear.    I am not a fan of Gore-Tex or other “waterproof” membranes in footwear - foot sweat is as much an issue as water for me. In any case the Gore-Tex doesn’t detract from my satisfaction.   I have two bonafide complaints:   1~ The boot welt does not accommodate step-in crampon bindings~ albeit it works fine with strap-on crampon binding systems;   2~ The top lace grommet exerts some pressure on my calf~ but biasing the tongue to that side eliminates the discomfort.   Ed
381,asolo,expert-gv,4.5,   Great lightweight versatile boot.   Pros   Cons   I bought these boots 8 years ago from REI. I have some challenges with the Italian welt at times. It seems my foot is slightly wide~ although never noticed with American shoes. As a result~ some Italian models are just too narrow~ while other models from the same manufacturer are a great fit.   I bought the Asolo Men’s Expert GV for the spring couloir climbing season in Colorado. For that reason I did not need a heavily insulated boot~ but did need waterproof. I did not need a particularly stiff boot but did need semi-automatic crampon compatible.     The couloir season is brief and by the time the snow compacts and is safe to climb and before it melts out~ you might get 3 or 4 climbs in~ some years only 2. So~ I would not say these boots have been heavily used although there is a lot of demanding foot work in couloir climbing and these boots have been put through it.   I climbed the Dragon’s Tail couloir just the other day and came down with wet socks. Ya~ they’re leaking now and need to be replaced. I would buy the Asolo Men’s Expert GV again if I could.
382,asolo,expert-gv,4.5,   Excellent boot for the price.   Pros   Cons   Bought these online for $285 six years ago and they fit well right out of the box. Unusual. I've got very narrow heels~ and have had a little blister issue on one heel after a long day of going uphill. Other than that~ NO problems with fit.   Love trekking and climbing in these. Very solid and supportive for foot and ankle. Thankfully a stiff sole for occasional front-pointing. Don't usually go thru water~ but have never noticed a problem. Traction is very good.Warm enough for three-season climbing in the Alps. Have not been above 5000 meters~ so not sure how warm they'd be up higher than that.     Have loved these boots so much — had them resoled this past summer by the famous Seattle cobbler~ and very pleased. Some wear and tear now on the stitching around the forefoot~ but it has been a good run.
383,scarpa,fitzroy,5.0,   I bought these boots new from Jackson Sports in Belfast~ U.K.~ and paid 140 GBP for them. Superb 3/4 season mountaineering boot. Took a while to break in~ but after that fantastic especially with crampons. Superb buy.
384,scarpa,fitzroy,4.0,   I've used my Fitzroys all summer and~ after enduring months of stiffness~ the soles and uppers are finally broken in.   To my knowledge~ Scarpa still makes this model.  They're still on the shelf at my local backpacking store and they're still on the Scarpa website: http://world.std.com/~fabiano/backpack.htm   I like these boots very much~ but you should be sure you need a heavy backpacking boot before you buy them.  They're definitely not for a stroll in the park~ unless of course you're heading for a week in the Smokey Mountain National Park.
385,scarpa,fitzroy,5.0,   I think these are now discontinued~ but in Missoula (former home) I found them and haven't seen them anywhere else. Pretty heavy boot~ very hard on my heels for the first 6 months (almost killed my right ankle on numerous occasions). After one year they seem pretty broken in but carrying a heavy pack and steep terrain will evoke hot spots and blistering~ still.   I have to say I love these boots to death. I think they will last forever as long as I resole appropriately. I have finally broke the stiff sole down enough to where I can climb steep mts. comfortably.     I have just bought Black Diamond Switchblade crampons and I hope these boots work well with the step-in bindings.   If you can find these boots anywhere (maybe Missoula)~ I recommend them highly.
386,asolo,afs-103,5.0,   The best mountaineering boot around. Especially for high altitude mountaineering. People have complained about them fitting smaller~ that's because you don't need heavy socks in them. They are made to withstand the elements~ and do. Very strong~ sturdy and very comfortable. Crampons go on quite easily and stay there~ thanks to the groved heel and toe. If you plan to do some serious mountaineering~ I recommend these boots. Well worth the money.
387,asolo,afs-103,4.0,   Stumbled on these boots on my trip through Paramus~ N.J.~ at Campmor in Dec. of 96. I've used them on numerous occasions on both winter hikes~ and long moderate ice climbs (Mt. Washington). I am pleased with their support while climbing vertical ice. They offer solid ankle support and unlike hinged plastic boots minimize stress on the calves. On hikes they are a bit stiff. It is difficult to walk up steep inclines flat-footed as there is little flex. The sole offers solid grip on all surfaces and the liner is warm enough for the coldest New England days.
388,la-sportiva,trango-extreme,4.0,   The La Sportiva Trango Extreme is a good boot for mixed climbing where rock shoe-like precision and gymnastics are needed~ but don't confuse it with an ice boot... it isn't a dedicated ice boot. There are problems that relate to the strengths of this boot for mixed.     The biggest problem with the boot is the extremely narrow heel profile compared to other mountaineering hybrids (like the Scarpa Freney XT).  This is a huge problem if you plan on climbing waterfall ice because the heel of your crampon will shift around and rob frontpointing energy. To my knowledge there is no crampon on the market that will remedy this problem with exception of the Petzl Dart with Sidelock rear bails (maybe) which is a mixed crampon to start.   So to all potential users... for summer mountaineering and mixed climbing this boot can't be beat... but there are more viable alternatives if you want to climb waterfall ice.
389,la-sportiva,trango-extreme,5.0,   These boots are very well suited to mountaineering and ice climbing in milder conditions. They are lightly insulated so I wouldn't do serious winter climbs in them if there is any chance of an unplanned bivy.    They are very light and have a flexible ankle. The sole has some flex in the fore foot. It is stiff enough to front point up vertical ice yet forgiving on the approach. The outsole has fairly sticky rubber with no lugs around the toe ara which makes them excellent for rock climbing.   I've been wearing this boot year round for both summer mountaineering and winter day climbs and I love it. I still wear my plastics when I want to ski into climbs~ but for almost everything else~ the weight and comfort of this boot rules.
390,la-sportiva,lhotse,5.0,   Great boots! Perfect for any serious climber. These boots are very versatile. Although~ designed for winter mountaineering~ they have become my year round climbing boots. I don't spend a lot of time on vert ice~ so I can't speak to their performance there. I do however~ do a lot of moderately mixed terrain~ couloir accents~ snow traverses~ etc. I have Black Diamond Sabertooth step-in crampons which work seamlessly with the Lhotses.    I do have narrow feet~ and have heard other climber mention that they thought the Lhotse was to narrow for their foot. They fit me like a glove~ and they are as comfortable as an old pair of Nikes. Highly recommended.
391,la-sportiva,lhotse,4.0,   Very good boot precise ice climbing.  Precise fit and feel allow for precise handling on all surfaces.  The center section of the boot sometimes feels a litte too tight but this may be unique to my feet.  Also the boot is VERY stiff but this is the trade off for precise handling and control. It's almost like an extension of your foot.
392,raichle,90-degree-exp-gtx,5.0,"   I never heard of Raichle before finding these boots in a local climbing/bike shop. I have to say~ for not doing any serious research~ I am very fortunate for blindly picking up these boots. I have not experienced any numbing cold ever in these wonderfully crafted boots. I have spent some extensive time on and at the base of icefalls in close to 0 degree F. Only one time did I ever even think ""is that my feet beginning to get cold or what?"". They accept my Grivel G-14 Crampons like they were meant to be together.    I personally guarantee your feet dry in these boots. I spent an entire night on a frozen lake plowing/shoveling snow to make an ice rink with these. We also busted through the ice and pumped about 3 inches of water on the surface and comfortably splashed around all night like that. The laces were frozen solid~ along with the rest of the exterior of the boot~ but I was good and comfy the whole time.    I have owned these boots for 3 years now and they still only look like they're 2 weeks old. I have a size 12 generally wider foot and the English conversion for size 12 was a good fit for me. Believe me when I say this boot lacks nothing. "
393,merrell,high-cascade,5.0,"   I have noticed that this is the first review for this boot~ so I hope I do it justice.  I purchased these boots for a couple of reasons: one~ I needed a durable boot for extended winter hiking with an adequately sized pack; two~ crampon compatible (not necessarily for ice climbing); three~ an all round boot for snow shoeing; and four~ price range.      I needed these boots in a hurry for trip to the Adirondacks~ and what caught my attention was the Merrell quote~ ""guaranteed to fit right out of the box.""  To my belief~ they did.  The normal break-in period for an alpine boot is about 4 weeks or 40-60 miles of hard hiking (depending on brand and who you talk to)~ but for the High Cascades~ the break-in period was minimal~ if there was one at all!     The Waterproofed Perwanger leather uppers~ in addition to the Waterproof glove leather linings~ which conformed to my foot nicely~ kept my feet dry.  I also used a pair Smartwool hiking socks~ which added warmth.   I am also pleased with the traction I am getting with these boots.  Built on a ""sharply lugged~ Vibram Ice Trek sole""~ they have delivered a reliable grip/brake performance in all snow/rock conditions.     So if you are looking for a durable alpine/winter hiking/trekking boot~ these are it.  I am very happy with the purchase~ and intend on keeping these boots in my trekking repertoire for a long time!"
394,garmont,pinnacle,5.0,   I gave these 5 stars for the fact that~ one they fit my feet perfect and have an excellent heel cup. Second~ I wore them straight out of the box on a weekend trip with 50 lb pack without a blister. And I usually get heel blisters in the beginning. I use them for heavy backpacking and mountaineering. They make a nice balance to give you one boot for packing in for an overnight or two and like 3-season mountaineering. I tried the Sportiva Glaciers~ for same purpose but could not get them to fit my feet.   The craftsmanship is solid so far and waterproofing has worked~ I've aslo added Nikwax. The vibram soles are excellent on rock and ankle support excellent on steep slopes and with crampons. I was looking for more a classic looking boot. I hear excellent things about Scarpas but ordered these first. They fit so well I stuck with them. I'm really in between a 10.5 and size 11. But I ordered 11s and they fit perfect. I would say they may run very~ very slightly smaller. I've tried 11s in other manufacturers that were larger. 
395,vasque,glacier,5.0,   I've searched high and low for mountaineering/heavy backpacking boots that will fit my narrow heel and wide toes~ and finally found the right boots at the right (too right to be true!) price.   The Glaciers look like the more easily available La Sportiva Makalu's but the Glaciers have leather-lined forefeet~ roomier toebox~ and snugger heels and instep. The upper also seems thicker than the Makalu's. They have stiff Viabram Clusaz soles that are step-in crampon compatible.   I got them by mail order but~ these boots were true to my Brannock device measurements~ so they fit right out of the box. (Get the typical one-half size longer than the actual measurement.) These are serious mountain boots so they do require more breaking in than Nike Air Mada's.    I'd rate them to be in the same caliber as the Scarpa Eiger~ La Sportiva Makalu~ and the Raichle Roseg.   They've been discontinued but I found my pair for $150.00 at Red Wing Shoe Store in Orem~ Utah. They have outstanding customer service~ and still have plenty of boots left the last time I checked.   -Ray
396,vasque,super-alpinista,5.0,"   I owned Asolo Annapurnas and didn't like them. Alaska Mountaineering and Hardwear had the Super Alpinistas on sale so I struck.   The Super Alpinistas are very warm; I have had extended use in them in -30F temps. I have wide feet and these boots feet great. I did get heel slip the first time I climbed so I use green Superfeet and am good-to-go now. Overall~ the fit is great; the boots even are comfortable for walking (sans crampons). I was warned that they would be ""too big and cumbersome"" but found that to be untrue. I suppose they are compared to small~ lower-48 style boots~ but these things were made to take a beating and are built tough. I still have plenty of maneuverability when I wear them.   Waterproofness is also fantastic. A climber above me punched through a waterfall and we had running water on us but my feet were dry.   The only concern beyond the original change in fit~ using the Superfeet~ is the lacing. I have to lace super-tight and walk for about 10-15 minutes. The movement works the lacing pressure even throughout the boot and I have to stop and retighten from there. Once I do it the second time~ I am good-to-go for the day. It seems like a pain when I'm doing it but overall~ it's not a big issue.   I would recommend these boots to medium and wide-footed people who are looking for a warm mountaineering boot. I would further recommend them to individuals who operate in multiple mountaineering activities versus those who ice climb only. There are boots tailored to ice climbing while the Super Alpinistas are made to take the entire mountain experience."
397,scarpa,manta-m4,5.0,   Excellent full shank all leather hiking/mountaineering boot~ takes C2 crampon~ beautifully made~ break-in period is bit tough (3-4 months) no blisters though. Now after 10 months they are superb~ so comfortable~ great support~ agility~ and feel great.    Excellent for hopping around on the rocks at high altitude or for fast descents~ useful for climbing too as sole is very stiff. Not great on approaches when breaking in~ but ok now. They look great still~ the reversed leather means no scuffing as with traditional leather. This is not a boot for approaches or general walking but is superb for heavy backpacking rough trails or entry level mountaineering.   I think the RSN last suits slightly slimmer foot that I have and I do find Scarpa's a little on the small size. As for toe box curling and shortening I haven't experienced that yet and have done well over 100 miles over very rough terrain. I'm using superfeet hiker green insoles which work great~ but I do concur with previous review~ don't go for anything thicker than superfeet as the ankle will roll. I use Bridgedale socks I find they are excellent. I'm looking forward to many years pleasure from my Scarpa Mantas.
398,scarpa,thermo-matterhorn,5.0,   This heavy leather mountaineering boot is great for cold weather climbing on ice cliffs~ alpine rock and glaciers.  It is a very nicely constructed boot with a one-piece leather upper~ full sticky rubber rands~ and a thinsulate lining. The thinsulate lining means that the boot is warm enough to be used in full winter conditions - although probably not warm enough for the himalaya or alaska. It also means that it will probably be a bit too warm for typical summer mountaineering conditions in the Alps~ Colorado or the Cascades. It has a nice high cut that supports well for long sessions of front pointing on ice walls; yet~ still allows for enough flexibility for alpine rock and for 'french' technique on glaciers or low-angle ice. The sole has a bit of rocker to it~ which adds to its comfort whilst walking. This rocker means that they work extremely well with the latest generation of the technical step-in crampons like the grivel rambocomp (for steep ice/mixed). It also works fine with semi-rigid crampons like the BD sabretooth (for alpine). They did not fit very well with the old 'flat' rigid crampons like footfangs.   The last is a bit wider and more forgiving than La Sportiva Nepal Extremes or my old Salomon Super Mountain Guide 9's. Quite comfortable right out of the box for the hike in and the first day's climbing. After a long day of ice cragging~ I did have some pain during the 3 mile hike back out to the car. However~ with each successive climbing day~ they've gotten better and better. I highly recommend these boots for all phases of winter mountaineering unless you are heading to the coldest places on earth.
399,garmont,fusion-mountain-guide,5.0,"   After suffering through a season of lost nails~ cold feet and monster blisters~ I decided to sell my Nepal Top's and get something that fit my wide (EE) feet. After trying on 7 different mountaineering boots (Salomon~ Scarpa~ La Sportiva~ HanWag~ etc.)~ I tried a pair of the Garmont Fusion Mountain Guides. The fit was instantly comfortable. After two hikes up to an alpine hut (Bow Hut - Cdn Rockies 5 hrs return)~ I was sold.    Recently I just finished 4 days on the Wapta Icefield and am happy to report that there were no hotspots~ the boots were warm acct the StormBloc lining~ they stayed dry (Nikwax) and they performed flawlessly on rock~ ice~ snow etc. because of the ""made for Garmont"" Vibram Ranger outsole. The boots are also very light and torsionally stiff. I can finally put away my duct tape blister prevention tape. For those of you who have wide feet and trouble fitting into mountaineering boots~ give these a try."
400,kayland,hyper-traction,5.0,   This is one really awesome boot!    Pros   Cons   I bought Hyper Traction for winter mountaineering and ice climbing. For these pursuits correct fit is essential as cold feet is the result otherwise. I have a slightly wide foot and my left foot is slightly bigger than my right. When it comes to American shoes~ the difference is not noticeable and no additional consideration for fit is necessary. But when it comes to mountaineering boots many Italian welts do not accommodate my width without creating detrimental length.   I tried on many boots to find the correct fit and found two that suited my purpose and comfortably accommodated my feet. The Kayland Hyper Traction and the La Sportiva Nepal EVO GTX are both really excellent boots.   Even within the same manufacturer~ like La Sportiva or Kayland~ some boots fit my feet and others do not. For instance I can wear the La Sportiva Nepal EVO GTX but the La Sportiva Trango S EVO GTX is too narrow. I can wear the Kayland Hyper Traction but the Kayland M-11+ is too narrow.   The Hyper Traction is pricy but Kayland has spared no expense when it comes to the material used. Dryver~ eVent~ Primaloft~ Schoeller~ Vibram~ this boot has all of the best materials. The water-tight RIRI Aquazip fastening and Velcro top side seal off the boot interior and make a more comfortable fit at the ankles than any boot I have worn. The E.C.T. Traction multi-layered composite insole makes a great crampon shelf for front pointing.   I have used the Kayland Hypertraction for three winters on Colorado 14er’s and ice climbing in Ouray and never had cold feet. I wear a size 9D street shoe and fit comfortably into size 10 Hyper Traction~ accommodating a thicker mountaineering sock.
401,garmont,fusion,5.0,   This is a non-insulated high-top leather climbing boot in the mold of the LaSportiva Nepal Top or the Salomon Super Mt. 9 Guide - in fact it seems to draw heavily on both for its inspiration. I got them off the sale rack for a great price. I don't even know if they can be found any more; which would be a shame - because they are really nice! Excellent worksmanship. Waterproofing is holding up well so far. They happen to fit my feet very well - kind of narrow in the heel/achilles and getting wider towards the toe. The toe-box is actually quite large which gives your toes some wiggle room (nice)~ but which made fitting step-in crampons a bit wierd. My old BD Switchblades (small size) wouldn't fit - the toe-bail wasn't wide enough. My new Trango Harpoon monopoints fit fine though. With those new crampons~ these boot climbed REALLY WELL!! During the hike out after my first day~ I did get a blister or two~ but I always get a blister or two from new shoes of any sort.    These are non-insulated~ so don't expect them to keep your feet warm during extended cold-weather conditions or high altitudes. But for regular New England or lower-48 roadside ice cragging~ I have seen the light. I won't go back to my plastic boots unless it is a super cold day.
402,lowa,silberhorn-gtx,5.0,   I set out for Colorado for a fourteener winter ascent and instead of the usual crusty snow we encountered the biggest snow storm to hit the front range this year (Feb 2010) which made mountain conditions an all out winter mountaineering experience.   My feet stayed warm but I did not sweat much in them at all; overall excellent insulation.  The temperature was about -10 F with a wind chill into the negative teens/low twenties.  The first part of our ascent was normal hiking on snow without snowshoes and they did not give any problems; they were extremely comfortable for a mountaineering boot~ however~ don't expect them to fit like street shoes.   I sized up a half size from what I normally wear and that worked great for me.  I did not develop any blisters or hot spots in our 18 mile hike.  They fit very similar to Lowa's hiking boots.  I did wear them for 25 hours at work and went on one 3 miles hike in the snow before I took them out and that was enough break in time.   They went great with snowshoes and especially great with crampons.  I didn't even use automatic step-in crampons but I can only imagine the improvement because of how good they performed with strap-on crampons.  The sole is extremely stiff which is what you want for a mountaineering boot.  If you were to venture into colder temperatures a super gaiter (over boot) would add the extra warmth for any expedition.   From someone who has actually used them in harsh mountain conditions I highly recommend this boot.
403,lowa,cevedale-gtx,5.0,   I use these for climbing 14ers in Colorado. Highly recommend for a variety of situations. These guys will get you up and down the mountain without ever losing traction or giving blisters...even straight out of the box.   Pros   Cons   I absolutely love this boot. I spent roughly an afternoon breaking these bad boys in and that was probably excessive. Out of the box they were very flexible and easy to work with.   For how durable and tough these guys are they are extremely light and easy to move in. The week I got these I immediately took them on a two-day hiking trip up two 14ers in Colorado. Since then I have done four more and these boots show no signs of wear or tear.   I simply just wash them off or run through a stream and they are good to go. I have also stood in streams to assist people with getting across and have never felt a drop of water touch my feet. If you are willing and able to spend the money it is well worth it.   I can't say how these will perform in the long run~ but they have handled everything I have thrown at them so far and I am expecting these to last well into the future.   Another nice feature with the newest version is the ball bearing lacing system...it's technology like this along with a durable boot that stays fairly cool with proper lacing that I believe sets LOWA apart. I messed around with some other boots before these and just ended up taking them back because the rocks and terrain I was on was tearing them apart.   When you are ready for a solid boot that can handle it all grab a pair of these. 
404,vasque,alpine,2.0,   First pair leaked as soon as they got wet. The second pair have lasted three seasons of work as a ranger. The inner gore-tex liner parted at the ankle cuff and they have just started to leak. The ankle cuff has rotted (I have taken care of them applying leather care on a regular basis).   These boots are a mediocre buy. I feel they should have lasted a bit longer.
405,vasque,alpine,3.0,"   I would have to agree with the above reviews that there is much to recommend in this boot if one wants a boot for heavy backpacking on rough trails. The full length steel shank helps when carrying heavy loads~ or to alleviate ball of foot pain. But these boots are comparatively heavy. And~ though people's feet are different~ the tops of my toes rub up against the fold that extends down to the foot of the tongue. Even after 250 miles of wear~ these boots still cause me blisters on top of my toes if I don't take precautions~ eg~ moleskin use. The second ""interior"" tongue on these boots only adds to the problem~ as the edge runs right along the same fold. This is a design flaw that could be easily remedied with a wider interior tongue."
406,vasque,alpine,5.0,   OK! Bear in mind I've only been outside with these once but I'm extremely pleased!  I'm a die-hard vasque fan and this clinches it.  After a very short break in~ I took them on a very diverse trip in Rocky Mtn Natl Park.     The trip in was approx. 4 miles with a heavy pack (2 ropes + tools and the usual).  the last mile was off-trail and rough.  All comfort~ no distress.  I used step-in crampons for 3 pitches of mixed snow and ice at about a 50 degree angle.  Calves got sore but that's not the boot's fault.     The only minor problem I encountered was after the last pitch where I had some extremely contorted french technique going on~ and then 4.5 miles back down to the trailhead~ I got one very minor blister on my right pinkie toe.  My right foot is a little wider than the left~ and this toe tends to get it in all my shoes.     Feet stayed warm and dry the entire time.  No pain the next day.  I had no sole-bruising despite conditions that would warrant it~ and tumbled around on the way down without twisting my ankles at all.   I don't yet know how they'll be in winter conditions~ but yesterday was great.  I'll recommend them!
407,vasque,alpine,4.0,   Good news for all of the people complaining about Alpines that were overly stiff and chewed up heels~ the sole is softer in the new models.  While this is good for backpacking~ it does make rock climbing with them a little more tiring.  I've used them for a few rock climbs (to try them out)~ but havn't had a chance to try them on the trail yet.  I've worn them for 5-6 hours at a time at work to break them in and find them very comfy.  My initial impressions of this boot are good~ so we'll see if everything is still good in a few months.
408,vasque,alpine,3.0,   The soles on these boots offer great traction.  However~ they do have an extremely non-flexible full steel shank that results in some tricky crossings over logs and other narrow ridges.    The boots are extremely waterproof~ though.  I can vouch that absolutely no foot perspiration ever escapes the boot!   I've had these boots for over two years and have more than 200 miles on them.  They STILL grind up my heels in no time at all. Dual socks~ polypro and moleskin don't stand a chance with this boot.  And they show no signs of breaking in yet.   I've given up on them.  It's just too risky to have my feet torn up in the backcountry.
409,vasque,alpine,3.0,   These are very nice boots and extremely waterproof.  The Vibram sole refuses to slip even on the steepest and slickest rocks.  There is no way to twist your ankle in these.   While that is all good~ they still destroy my heels whenever I hike over 2 miles (uphill especially).  I have had them for four years so they should be broken in by now.  I have tried many different sock combinations with no luck.  I even tried slapping on tons of moleskin~ but the boots just ate right through.   On a recent trip to Tuckerman's Ravine on Mt. Washington they rubbed all the skin off my heels.  The hike up was completely misserable.  It ruined the entire trip for me as I could not ski the next day (I could hardly put on my running shoes).   I don't know whether it is my large foot (size 13)~ narrow foot (B-C width)~ or narrow heel but these boots just suck.  I keep hoping that they will work out for me as they are the most waterproof and stable boots I have owned.  I think it's time to call it quits.
410,vasque,alpine,5.0,   These replaced a pair of 23-year-old Pivettas that will one day be rebuilt.  The Alpines are not for those who need a light hiking boot; rather they are very stiff and specifically designed for trekking.  After putting on over 80 miles in less than a month they are now feeling like they are part of my body when blazing trails.   I have just returned from a solo~ 23 mile trip to Death Valley where the terrain was the worst I've ever encountered.  Due to the complete lack of water~ I had to carry 3 gallons and my pack weighed in at just about 73 lbs. The boots performed flawlessly when traversing alluvial fans~ and scrambling up ancient waterfalls.  Stiff~ secure and comfortable where the Alpines despite the fact that in 23 miles~ not a trail was to be found.. Only cross-country orienteering.   Step-in crampons are the main reason I purchased the boots~ which fit perfectly.  Waterproofness is enhanced due to the full Gore-Tex lined booty.  Streams just become another source of route taking.   One warning about the break-in period.  If you don't take the time to stretch these puppies~ your feet will resemble raw~ ground~ hamburger meat in no time flat.  In fact~ I sent my Vasques to Dave Page Cobblers in Seattle to have them professionally stretched prior to me attempting mile one!  The procedure expedited the break-in period considerably.
411,vasque,alpine,5.0,   Excellet boots. I am very pleased. However~ they do require a break-in period (but don't give up they are worth it). I climbed Long's Peak in Colorado this summer and felt surefooted even when I was hoping~ skipping~ and jumping around in the boulderfield. I don't think twisting an ankle in these boots is possible.    The gore-tex works great and with gaiters I feel that I could wade across the Mississippi River without my feet getting wet. However~ the leather on the toes show some wear and may be a possibility of a blowout later down the road~ maybe boot companies will come out with carbon fiber toed boots (steel toed would be too heavy)~ its just an idea.     I love the boots and if you can survive the initial heart-attack after looking at the price~ they are worth it. My wonderful and beautiful girlfriend helped me out and made it possible for me to be able to afford these boots. For an all pourpose extended backpacking/mountaineering boot this is it. However~ don't just run out and buy them~ check some other boots out first~ maybe another company produces boots which will better fit your feet~ I don't know. I heard the LaSportiva Makalus were good as well as the One Sport Morains.  I bet you will come back to the Alpines though.
412,vasque,alpine,5.0,   I hiked 15 miles with a 70 pound pack on a trek in the Rocky Mountains in the rain.  Held up great.
413,vasque,alpine,5.0,   Last summer I was given the oportunity to lead my church youth group on a trek in the Rockey Mountains in Colorado.  In doing so we covered a six mile ascent on the first afternoon.  At that point I was carrying just over 100lbs in my pack.  My Vasques did a great job and I arrived mor eunhappy with the city slickers who had come than with the boots.  On the second day we made an ascent on Mt. Yale and for the first part of the trip it rained in buckets~ then in the higher altitudes it turned into snow and by the time we reached summit we were in snow up to our shins.  Combined with a good pair of Gators my feet stayed nice and dry and most importantly very comfortable.  On the following day we headed back down from the Mountain grandure.  Thanks to the boots on my feet this was quite possibly the best trek of my life. And yes I do and have recomended these boots to anyone who is serious about backpacking in rough terrain or when inclimate conditions are the norm  instead of the exception!
414,vasque,alpine,5.0,   These boots are the most comfortable I've ever worn.  Blister free on a 100 mile trek right out of the box and still going strong after a year of hard use.
415,vasque,alpine,5.0,   These boots are solid performers for backpacking with heavy loads.  I just bought them at the beginning of this winter and have found them to require very little break-in.  In addition to just backpacking~ these boots accept crampons and you can even get away with snowboarding in them.
416,vasque,alpine,3.0,   These boots are comfortable~ But I don't think they are the most durable boots on the market~  I've had them a little over 2 years and they are just about ready to retire.  The leather has worn very thin on the toes from kneeling down~ bumping on rocks~ etc.  It has also worn around the 2nd set of eyelets (right where the boot bends).  I believe that Vasque was aware of this problem the year I bought them and hopefully they corrected it.  The Goretex worked like a charm~ it kept water out during all 4 seasons.  I think my next boots will be La Sportiva Makalu's (if they fit my narrow foot).
417,la-sportiva,nepal-top,2.0,   It's the old problem: Should a shoe fit right away or do we have to allow several hikes to achieve that? Personally~ I believe that a well fitting shoe gives you very few problems even during its first use. (Some models by Scarpa confirmed this idea) The Nepal Top is a very technical boot with almost no flex and no rocker; therefore they make your feet very clumsy when walking~ like walking in ski boots and this becomes quite tiring soon. The lacing cuts into your instep so that I had to modify the lacing system. To add insult to injury~ after only an hour I got hotspots on my big toes which developed into blisters in no time. (The toebox is the part that will definitely not stretch in a shoe like this) So I was very unhappy with this aquisition and I will go back to Scarpa~ which so far have been excellent for my feet
418,la-sportiva,nepal-top,3.0,"   For those of you who are seriously looking to get ice climbing boots and are deciding on the Nepal~ or any other brand for that matter.  I am going to be honest.  Any stiff rigid boot takes time to break in.  I don't believe when they say ""comfortable right out of the box""...maybe if they were talking about sandals.  These type of boots take time and use to get them to fit you well.  You'll see what I mean when you use them.     I am not hear to slam any boot~ simply...don't expect slippers.  Expect a blister here and there.  I have been around enough times to see it again and again.  But~ over time and use~ they will fit you well.  And they always feel heavy~ especially after a day of shoeing or skiing to a climb~ and then climbing the remainder of the day.     Well~ that is all i have to say.  If you have any questions~ feel free to ask."
419,la-sportiva,nepal-top,5.0,   I bought my first pair of these boots about 6 years ago and bought them also for very very cheap (~250can)...right out of the box I was amazed at the comfort and confidence they gave me...I used them extensively for most of my climbing trips in the Cascades and Coast mountains...comfy on any approach right up to alpine rock and steep alpine and waterfall ice I never once questioned how the boot performed...I love them and have just purchased my second pair as the old ones are now beyond repair...I do however still use lighter weight boots when it makes   more sense than wearing a larger boot but this saves my nepal tops for extended life...looking forward to more climbs in my favourite boot...
420,la-sportiva,nepal-top,5.0,   I somehow lucked out with these boots. Initially purchased for mixed routes and technical stuff~ these boots soon obsessed me. Now I do almost anything that brings me near snow with these babies. I tend to get myself into long approaches followed by brief moments of glory. These boots perform throughout. For 4 years now I have been skiing in them. I use Silveretta bindings on Atomic Outback TR skiis. I have gone to nirvana. I can hike miles of trail without dying in plastic or swapping boots. Then I skin/ climb / swwoooshhh. Since there is miles of tree skiing to be done to and from the glory holes of the Cascade~ often on narrow Icy Trails I highly reccomend this set up to cascade Backcountry Skiiers. Even My Tele Friends drool. ( oh by the way you can do a descent tele-esque turn in silvrettas. I never lock them down)
421,la-sportiva,nepal-top,4.0,   After a disastrous experiance with a pair of scarpa Fitzroys which now feel and bend like carpet slippers!! I bought - reluctantly - Nepal Tops.   I feel its still a little too early to be completely satisfied But while I'm always aware of the weight I havent had any blisters yet!! Rock climbing in them is a dream~ walking.... the jury is still out. Snow and Ice? well~ we ised to have that white stuff in the UK but these days holidays and snow rarely co inside. - Still the Alps await and thats why I bought the boots in the first place!! I'll let you know.
422,la-sportiva,nepal-top,5.0,   I love these boots... they're perfect for the type of conditions I climb in... I love the fact that I can actually walk in the things... They allow French technique on ice. And they frontpoint as well as any of the plastic boots my buddies wear.
423,la-sportiva,nepal-top,5.0,   I've had these boots now for several seasons - I was lucky enough to buy them from a shop who had ordered them directly from Italy~ and therefore the price was an absolute steal at only $230 Canadian!!!  Now they are $460~ but I'm laughin'.  I found the boots very comfortable right out of the box; in fact~ I took them on an all-day steep climb/hike/scramble for their first trip and was amazed that there were no blisters~ pressure points~ etc.~ especially given the fact that the trail was very steep and quite the slog.     I've used them a fair bit for technical ice now~ when it's warmer~ with Black Diamond Switchblade crampons~ and love their performance.  It's more like climbing ice in a rock shoe~ and it is so nice not to have all that slippage one gets between inner and outer boots of a double plastic boot.  My only complaint about the boot is that it does have a little more flex than I'd like - don't get me wrong~ it has very little flex~ I just have this odd preference of technical boots to be not flexible at all.  All in all it is a great boot and I would recommend them to anyone.
424,la-sportiva,nepal-top,5.0,   I love these boots... They feel so much less clunky than my plastic boots. They fit like a glove... and climb really well...
425,lowa,civetta,1.5,   I usually use the boots once every couple of years. I was climbing Cotopaxi last week~ and at 16~000 ft. one of the boots cracked in half~ so instead of going for the summit I had to end my climb and head down. By the time I got to the parking lot both boots were cracked.    When I got home I called Lowa customer service~ and they said there is nothing that we can do for you. Thus~ I would not purchase these boots if you are planning on serious climbing. 
426,lowa,civetta,3.0,   I bought them used off ebay. Functionally great; I've used them for snowshoeing~ ice climbing~ and hiking. I'd give them 5 stars if they were warm. I used to throw one of those hand warmer packets into the toe of each boot~ but then I bought custom fit Intuition Denali liners for $150 and now my feet are toasty even on ice. More comfortable too.
427,lowa,civetta,5.0,"   Excellent fit for me~ quite warm for a non-vapor barrier boot.   Pros   Cons   I got these at a closeout sale in Montreal a few years back (my first plastic boots).  I tried several other brands~ but these were the only ones that fit from the get-go.  I bought a size larger as I knew I was going to include an extra insole (a trick l've learned with boots in winter).    They did not need any real breaking in~ and feel like comfy ""foot gloves"".  I've read some complaints about warmth~ but they kept my feet warm in temperatures below -40°."
428,lowa,civetta,5.0,   I got these boots 4 years ago and they were~ from the get go~ the most comfortable boots I have ever worn. They work well on steep ice or hiking on dirt trails. I have used them from trips to Ranier~ Baker~ Adams~ Hood~ to full conditions on Mt. Washington in New Hamshire. My feet have never been anything other than warm and dry.  My foot fangs do not compress the boot in anyway and they hold true to their form. A great boot at a great price!
429,lowa,civetta,4.0,   I had a tough choice between a nine and a half (my street shoe size usually) and a ten and a half (USA sizes)....   I found the 'rocker' on the nine and a half to be perfect but that my toes bumped the front of the boot and I had only a light sock on..... so though the boots worked fine for working out in the snow for the few hours I knew if I did a whole day backpacking my feet would swell and give me a real headache!! unfortuantely~ the next size wasn't available so I stepped up to a 10 and half... now I can stay warm and cozy with two pairs of socks plus liner..(as my excellent La Sportive Makalus weren't warm below 10 degrees farenheit).. The only downside so far though is that the larger boot's rocker seems a little too far foreward and some clumsyness is a result. For steep climbing perhaps the smaller boot would be better and thus why I see some people wearing overboots even with these plastic boots... I've spent two whole days on concrete slabs and in deep snow moving lumber and carpentry and so far they are comfortable~ but just a little clumsy (like a reinforced Sorel boot..) I may have to wait til next year for a more backcountry use... these are not as comfortable as my Scarpa new T3 telemark boots... (except for walking) or my aforementioned Makalus....which are only 9 and a halfs and maybe a little tight for long treks but so far have worked great a day in and day out construction and mild hiking boots... and keeping my feet without usual pain due to heal spurs (another review earlier on the Makalus I did>>>)
430,lowa,civetta,5.0,   They are the perfect boots for someone who wants the warmth of a plastic ice boot~ and the control of a leather boot.   I have used them on verticle waterfall ice and on mixed routes~ and they kick butt. They are warm and tough~ but not at all bulky.   They have a very low profile~ and fit nice and snug. Walking in them is better then other boots I have worn.
431,lowa,mountain-expert-gtx,4.5,   Great boot! Warm~ comfortable~ and breathable!    Pros   Cons   Really comfortable boot! I've used them for snowshoeing in the dead of winter (-20 degrees C) ~ and climbing in the summer. They breathe well and have stayed waterproof so far!   I find that they are nice and stiff so I can easily wear a step-in crampon~ or kick into hard snow to make a step.   I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a good all around mountain boot.
432,lowa,mountain-expert-gtx,4.0,   Great pair of boots. I picked them up for $50 at an REI scratch and dent sale and have not looked back!   Great in snow and trail. I have had them in temps of -30 F and started to get cold. At -20 F they worked like a champ!   They are a bit bulky for hikers so I would suggest some tennis shoes if you are doing a long approach.   Overall I have been very pleased with them and have held up better than most of my friends.
433,lowa,mountain-expert-gtx,0.0,   It's a disposable boot!   Rocks cut and damage the sides.  Eventually [months actually]~ 'IF' you have really really exhaust yourself on the cliffs~ the shale~ and upon the cutting rock edges of the Tombstone range~ you will realize it is a disposable boot.   The Gortex opened to water penetrations.   Constantly cleaning them.  I eventually used a tube of Lock-Tite [black] silicon to seal them.   But~ now they have to be rebuilt and I'm asking 'why'?  I expect more~ but this is today.   I have now read everything I could on the Norwegian and Italian boot companies [if you can find them].  Everything is mostly style~ colours~ and for me dissapointemts.  I'm very hard on my boots because my work depends on them.   Maybe I should just suck it up and say they're just a tax deduction every year.  Better yet... Fly to Norway/ Italy and get the real thing and deduct that trip too!  hahaha   Of course if you parade on the open grasslands of any field or prairie they'll do.   PS ... I have never done this except now cause I saw this here.
434,lowa,mountain-expert-gtx,5.0,   Great boots.   I need  US  10 size in  the city~  but I buy US 10.5.   In June 2010 I was in Georgia Mt. Kazbegi (5033m mkinvartsveri). Weather was very hot~ just  one warm socks~ I feel very comfortable all day.
435,lowa,mountain-expert-gtx,4.5,   <p>Terrific product~ period.  I have used them on several outings now and they have performed admirably.  Way easier on my legs and feet than my plastics~ and I the conditions I have been in~ just as warm.   I haven't been below 10 Fahrenheit~ so keep that in mind if you are using them in really cold places.  I have used them for general winter hiking and for multi pitch 3+/4- climbing.  The reason they're not a 5 is because my weak little calves would like something with a bit more stiffness for the sweet vertical sections.</p><p><br></p>
436,lowa,mountain-expert-gtx,5.0,   Warm and light. I don't have to put toe warmers in my shoes anymore. They are waterproof too~ something my last boots did not live up to.   Take a while to break them in.
437,raichle,all-degree-lite-gtx,4.0,   I've used these for everything from Scottish walking to winter mountaineering. They are extremely comfortable and the close fit is great for scrambling and climbing.  They have a thin sole so they aren't the best for long tabs. I mainly use them for summer mountaineering now for which they are excellent.    On the downside however~ despite being well made and finished they haven't really worn very well. The rand has started the tear and peel back and both boots now leak extremely badly at the heels. I'm putting up with the leaking as they are only used now on routes and rarely see Scottish bog trotting.    Overall very good boot for its purpose but I am disappointed with the wear and leaking.  
438,raichle,all-degree-lite-gtx,5.0,   I've had these for about four months now~ and have used them for mountaineering and long hikes. The second time I used them I hiked about 14 miles. I was shocked that my feet felt so good when we got to the car. I've previously owned leather mountaineering boots~ and would have been limping out had I tried that with them. I admit~ they're not quite as good for kicking steps in snow. However~ having comfortable feet is worth the trade-off for me.  
439,raichle,all-degree-lite-gtx,1.0,   First of all~ I loved the fit~ comfort~ and stability of this boot. Unfortunatly~ a year later after only about 10 uses and no hardcore use the inner leather of the seam above my arch pulled out of the stitching (thread still intact on outer leather) along a 3-inch section over a 20-mile backpack. I haven't ever had that happen in 35 years even on light boots~ let alone so called mountaineering boots on glaciers~ vertical ice~ and rock. I hesitate to even call this a backpack boot.
440,raichle,all-degree-lite-gtx,5.0,   These boots were comfortable right out of the box. I used them for a winter mountaineering class and plan to do the Whitney mountaineer's route in them in the summer. I've owned other Raichle boots and they seem to fit my feet best. The boots are also lightweight and have a good lacing system. I'd recommend them.
441,scarpa,triolet-gtx,4.0,   Great comfortable boot. Perfect for 3 season climbing on rock and up to moderate ice.    They weren't warm enough for cold winter climbing. I do a lot of winter climbing in the Rockies and I thought I was going to get frostbite the first time I took them below about 10F.
442,scarpa,triolet-gtx,3.0,"   DO NOT BUY THESE BOOTS. These boots were comfortable right out of the box. Plenty of space in the toe box~ not ""pinched"" from above like equivalent models from Sportiva~ etc.     That being said~ the first time I wore these (on a relatively moderate trip in the White Mountains in New Hampshire)~ the rubber ""lip"" on the upper exterior~ above the toe~ separated from the flimsy naugahyde surface material~ which also developed a tear.     I sent them back to Scarpa for a warranty repair or replacement. Scarpa insisted I had done the damage myself with crampons; no way this is true~ I wasn't wearing crampons. Scarpa refused to offer a new pair of boots~ instead did a miserable repair job on the separated rubber layers by smearing liberal amounts of shoe-goo on the outside.    Scarpa deserves to be taken to the mat for this sort of half-baked repair work. If they aren't going to replace them~ at least have the decency to do a quality repair job. I wouldn't buy these boots again~ or anything else from Scarpa until they improve their warranty work."
443,scarpa,triolet-gtx,5.0,   Just returned from four days in the North Cascades~ WA.~ where I put these new boots through the works. I wore them to work for a few weeks prior~ but I don’t believe they needed it. From miles of trail approach to more miles of loose granite talus~ steep mud~ snow~ ice~ and rock! Ending result: no blisters~ no soreness~ excellent friction on rock~ light~ flexible~ breathable~ waterproof~ felt great in crampons~ fit well on my narrow feet. They rival the La Sportiva~ Trango series. Slightly heavier~ but will last longer.
444,asolo,alpinist-gv,4.5,   Buying boots is a personal affair~ so let your feet decide. My feet love these boots. I use them for guiding backpacking trips into remote parts of Alaska~ and they support my feet on rocks and lumpy vegetation happily. They are a stiff boot~ but they have enough flex and rocker to make walking comfortable for the long haul. I've used them pretty hard for 2 seasons~ and they are holding up OK.    My only qualm with Asolo is that some of the stitching appears to be designed to wear out so that you'll have to buy a new pair eventually (planned obsolescence). On these boots~ instead of continuing the rubber rand all the way around the foot~ there is a patch of stitching that goes right down to the sole. I covered mine in seamsealer as soon as I bought them~ and that has helped~ but I think those vulnerable stitches will be a problem in the long run.   They get a 4.5 because my feet smile whenever I put them on.
445,asolo,lothar-gv,4.5,   The Asolo Lothar is a light mountaineering boot. Very light - at just 641 g per boot - Lighter than any other mountaineering boot I've ever owned. Overall~ I'm quite happy with them so far for hiking~ approaches~ peak bagging~ and scrambling.   Overview - a leather/nylon upper with a gore-tex lining. Rubber rand almost all the way around the boot. Vibram sole. A pretty stiff~ full plastic midsole extends to the back of the heel with a little platform. This~ in combination with the rubber rand on the toe area allows for support for 'new-matic' crampons. Lacing extends down towards the toes. They are high cut~ but perhaps not a high cut as some other boots. What's light mountaineering? In my opinion it involves trips with hiking~ scrambling~ and some easier technical snow~ rock and ice climbing. Light mountaineering (in my opinion) does not include extended periods of difficult technical climbing. I would never expect to use these boots~ for example~ for any kind of extended front-pointing on vertical ice.   These happen to fit my feet quite well. They are a bit on the narrow side~ but not radically so. I find them very comfortable compared to other mountaineering boots I've owned. They are probably pretty consistent with other Asolo boots. If you have a history of fitting well in Asolo boots~ these will probably follow suit.   The goretex liner has worked well enough - certainly as well as the w/b liner in other boots I've worn. I've had no problems with leaks. I've exposed these to wet conditions in the form of exposure to rain~ stream crossings~ snowfields and snow climbs.   I will raise one issue with these boots compared to other mountaineering boots that I've owned: Sole Design. I'll use another boot as a direct comparison - the Kayland MXT. Overall~ these two boots have very similar designs. One key difference is the design of the sole. The Asolo Lothar's sole has quite a bit of rocker. The Kayland MXT has virtually none - it is almost dead flat. This is a design decision with trade-offs. The sole with rocker provides a much more natural walking gait on trails. The flatter sole is designed to provide more rubber contact with rock/snow/ice. So - you might want to take this into account when thinking about the boots you choose for the trip you're doing. My Lothars can be used as regular hiking boots. They are very comfortable on the long hike into the peak and back to the car. There are occasional times when the highly rockered sole does not give me as much friction on rock slabs (since there's simply not as much rubber in contact with the rock). My Kayland MXTs~ on the other hand~ are not as comfortable for the long hike (I notice it most on the way out after a long day - my feet feel pretty beat up after long walks on trails). However~ the flatter soles on the MXTs seem to give me a more predictable 'feel' on technical rock climbs and kicking steps in snow. Note that the sole design will also have an impact on the crampons you use. Some crampons are designed to fit a rockered sole; others will work better with a flatter sole. Just one more thing to pay attention to when buying your equipment. Overall~ the differences are not super dramatic. I am still happy with how the Lothars climb rock and snow; and~ I can still hike in my MXTs. But the sole design~ in my opinion~ does present a set of drawbacks/benefits one vs the other.   So~ I do highly recommend these boots for light mountaineering trips that include a lot of mileage on trails to get to the peaks. However~ if my trip involves more technical climbing and less time on trails~ I'll probably choose my Kayland MXTs.
446,scarpa,summit-gtx,4.0,   I hiked with these boots all winter in the White mountains and climbed 13 of the four thousand footers including Mount Washington with them. I give them 5 stars for comfort.    My only gripe~ and it's a small one~ is their warmth. I wish they were warmer. But~ as with all things~ it's a trade off. They're a relatively light single leather Winter boot. Initially I wore them without toe warmers and found my toes hovering around~ but never becoming~ numb. With the addition of toe warmers I never had a problem. I would have concerns on a long hike well below zero F without toe warmers.    Other than that~ I love them. Took step in crampons beautifully and were sure footed when bare booting. Excellent Scarpa quality. 
447,scarpa,summit-gtx,4.5,   I use this great quality mountaineering boot for ice climbing. It fits my narrow~ high arched foot.     Pros   Cons   I used this boot for all my ice climbs last winter. I wanted a tight fit from toe to heel as I don't like the feeling of my foot slipping back in my boot on a lead. I wore them dawn to dark for 30 climbs. They were great for long approaches~ even in snowshoes. Very few blisters on break-in thanks to duct tape. My feet did not move when climbing and they are waterproof.   Because leather is so darned cold and it takes only a little snow to start a foot freeze~ I used toe warmers EVERY time.    I'll be using these until they fall apart.
448,lowa,alpine-guide,3.5,   These are interesting boots. I like them but don't love them. They're claimed to be designed for alpine climbing situations. I have used them for winter hikes and snowshoeing. I do not use them for actual winter climbing. These don't work well enough with crampons. They are good for rock scrambling and hiking though - especially in snowy conditions.    I went back and double-checked the original marketing language that Lowa wrote to describe the boots. It says something to the effect of 'can be used with crampons for glacier walking.' That's fine. You can use strap and 'newmatic' crampons with these just fine for walking on ice. But the boots are not nearly supportive enough for any real front pointing. That said~ they are comfortable~ the soles are aggressively lugged vibram that work very well in the snow/mud/slush/ice and are quite sticky on both dry and wet rock. They are warm (lightly insulated with 'Outlast'). They are mostly waterproof.    Another reviewer mentioned that there is a small area where the lacing ends down by the toes that leaks. I have experienced this as well in very wet conditions.    They are excellent winter hikers that should not be confused with real climbing boots.
449,lowa,alpine-guide,4.0,   I have had these boots for about 18 months now. They are comfortable and supportive when hiking with a heavy pack~ though they are a tad narrow for my American spoon-shaped dogs~ they are comfortable and good for rock scrambling.    While far too soft for any extended front-pointing in crampons~ they do okay on low angle glacier ice though they crank on your ankles a bit because they aren't very high or stiff. My main complaint is that the synthetic material that connects the tongue to the sides of the boots isn't very water resistant so my feet get wet after 4-6 hours in the snow.
450,kayland,apex-xt,3.0,   I am a forester and bought these boots because of the Vibram sole. Hard to find a hiker/light weight mountaineering boot with a Vibram sole.   I have worn them in the pine of VA for 1 week~ and today is the first day back home working in WV.  I wore them 2 days prior to break them in. So~ a total of worn 8 days in the woods.   The rubber from the toe around on the in step on both pairs are peeling half off now. The woven fabric inserts at the break in the boot are starting to show fiber breakage from the movement of walking. I do not see the durabilty at all.    I paid a little less than some of the $220 + advertised on the web~ but still not pleased with the product.  I am only 7 days in and work 5 days a week in the woods wearing them. So~ it will be interested to see how long they do last.   They are light~ they do take 2 days of use to break in~ the traction is great~ not too bad on warmth in the summer~ haven't tried the waterproofing yet (but not good signs with the cracking fiber material)~ A good set of insoles are a must~ i repeat a must!!  After you get that they are comfortable.   I'd say if you are a recreationalist needing a good boot for the special trips~ yeah possible. If you need a boot to work in~ and wear more than on occasion not a good design! 
451,kayland,apex-xt,5.0,   These are great boots for mixed routes and Alpine climbing. They do well on snow but excel on long approaches bushwacking through varying conditions. They are light weight~ breathable~ and have excellent support. The full shank make ice climbing and edging on rock sections easy.    Pretty much the best boots for mountaineering and climbing I have ever used. 
452,scarpa,cumbre,4.0,   I've used these for mostly for Scottish winter stuff~ mixed and ice as well as walking. Also in Norway for icefalls.    Boot is really really nice and stinks of quality. The flex ankle makes Scottish walk ins a doddle. Very very comfortable boot and is starting to rival the Nepal Extreme in popularly here in the UK.         However the asymmetric sole~ designed for a better dexterity~ makes getting a good crampon fit hard in the bigger sizes~ the crampon sits off centre because of the sole. I put in 'banana bars' to adjust this~ fine for general mountaineering but the front points are too angled inwards for ice I find.  As I said this is only a prob with bigger sizes.    Also Scarpa are quite a narrow fit so I went a size bigger than normal. The heel is quite wide at the heel which has proved a problem on steeper stuff. I've just replaced them with a pair of Raichle 90 deg EXP which are a much better fit for my feet.    Overall these have been great for the past 4 years but the fit has been ok for easier stuff but the movement in the heel has become annoying on the steeper ice. Emmm~ excuses.    If they fit your feet these will be brilliant. Generally. 
453,scarpa,freney,4.0,   Designed for high-end ice climbing and mountaineering~ these are interesting boots. I'd recommend them more for mountaineering than pure ice climbing. They don't offer the kind of stiff ankle support necessary for long bouts of sustained front pointing (in my opinion). They are billed as a super-sensitive lighweight boots for the hardest of today's ice and mixed climbing routes. They rock climb better than any other mountain boot I've ever tried. And~ they are absolutely fabulous for french technique. It's ok to front point in them for a while~ but there are much better boots out there for pure sustained waterfall ice. Ice/mixed climbing~ maybe you'd use them for some desperate short route right at your limit; but I'm keeping them for mountaineering. The sole is pretty stiff. The uppers are quite flexible. There is no rocker to the sole~ and the last is aymetrical. This can make fitting certain crampons problematic. For ice~ they worked better with my older Trango Harpoons (flat) than with my new Grivel Rambos (rockered). For mountaineering~ they work spectacularly with my BD Sabertooths. They have some thinsulate in them~ and are fairly warm; but I wouldn't push it with these in ultra-cold conditions. Very well made and comfortable.
454,kayland,8001,4.0,   Pros   Cons   It's an outdated model from Kayland. They took these from the production line two years ago~ if I am not mistaken. I bought the boots from a Spanish ebayer who was liquidating his mountain gear store two months ago. They looked solid and well build when I took em right out of the box. Having a double boot which is a first time for me~ made me think my feet will never get cold until I snuggle in my sleeping bag and indeed~ I was very comfortable when I wore em during a 4000+ m summit attempt last weekend. Weight-wise they are heavy compared to lighter alpine boots~ but the warmth they provide overshadows the weight issue. The boot itself is pretty much a mountaineering boot with all the necessities except a membrane. The Velcro strap~ just like the one in ski boots~ right above the boots lacing locks the upper and the tongue around the user ankle tight~ making quick put on and take offs easy without tying and untying the boots all the time while on the camp site. Neoprene impregnated/glued Kevlar and a wide rubber rand covers and circles the pack leather boot. I know it's a big mistake to take a new pair of boots to a summit attempt~ but I did it by taking these to one particularly hard one this last weekend. I thought having an independent separable boot inside the rigid one would have shortened or eliminate the break-in period. No exaggeration~ but it sure did just that and I got no problem. Although~ they seamed and felt OK to wear in the first glance~ after a 10+ hour climbing adventure in them~ I felt discomfort on my soles~ particularly on the right one. I presume this discomfort also made my right foot susceptible to cold as well. However~ cold feeling did not last long~ it came and went on and off for a couple of times. The discomfort I felt was definitely due to not so quality insole that came with the boots. At the end of the day~ my feet was dry except the perspiration. When I unzipped the boots~ I saw dampness on the neoprene~ but it did not pass through the inner boots. The integrated gators stitched above the Kevlar cover are flimsy and do not stay put where they reach under/around ones knee~ better to use a real gator on top. However~ due to very centered all the way zipper which looks heavy duty~ no front gator hook is placed on the boots. It's a mishap~ but not too much of a big deal. Overall~ they felt OK~ however do they perform flawlessly above 7000 m just like the model name claims? try and see on your own risk~ I do not think I will ever get that high.                
455,mammut,marconi-gtx,4.0,   I'm pleased with these boots overall. These boots are very stiff~ but~ I think they're supposed to be.   I've had them about a month and have wore them around town and just wore them on about a 10-11 mile backpacking trip in cold icy conditions. When I started the trip there was snow and temps were around 25 degress F. I climbed and descended what I consider to be a steep~ rocky~ rooty trail~ Alum cave trail - Smokies.   About 1/3 of the way up I attached crampons to the boot and they held great. I made it to the top where the temp was 0 degrees F with warm feet and no hot spots. However~ once I stopped moving my feet did get cold~ as did the rest of my body though.   For the overnight I placed a disposable hand warmer in each boot and when I woke up the next morning the boots were dry. I put the boots on at -2 degrees F with fresh dry socks and my feet were very comfortable.   On the way down the mountain I did get 4 hot spots and 2 blisters. I think my feet are almost broken in to the boots now. I think the blisters are really from me rolling my ankles so many times on this trail due to crampons. The blisters were not the normal spots and were on the sides of my feet.   As for ankle support~ I would have to give these boots a perfect score. I rolled my ankles at least 100 times and never really hurt them except for soreness at the end of the trip. The lacing is impressive and seems to let you adjust lace tension into 3 zones.   I like these boots and would recomend them.
456,vasque,apex,4.0,   Have over 300 miles on these in size 11.5D (am in-between 11e-11.5d) and these fit perfectly. Previously had Vasque Sky Walkers (light hikers) for 9 years (resoled with Vibram) and loved them as well~ though I realized my feet grew and they became tight.      These boots are stiff and you cannot run streams as you can with lightweight boots. Even insulated they tend to make you sweat a bit in midsummer but will dry fast at camp.   Very good sole and very good ankle support make a great heavy packing and mountain trail ascension boot. I have added insoles taken from my other boots. I can easily give my recommendation. They also make good hunting boots in the winter.
457,vasque,apex,5.0,   I bought these boots for mountaineering~ and they worked great. Great support~ great traction~ and very waterproof. I have had them for close to three years~ and they still look and work like new. The sole has hardly worn down at all~ over constant use in the alpine zone. Work great with step-in's~ and they are the perfect stiffness for vertical ice. All in all~ a well-rounded boot. 
458,vasque,apex,5.0,   I've put in over 400 miles on these boots and never had a blister. They are excellent. If fitted correctly~ and given a proper break-in~ they work perfect. Enough Said.
459,vasque,apex,5.0,"   Having had trouble finding a size 14 in anything comfortable~ I wore these babies straight out of the box with heels cloaked in mole skin up Mount Whitney this past weekend.  They performed great and I only have a couple nickle-sized heel blisters which were expected.   They never rolled off a rock~ and I felt like I'd break a tibia before an ankle.  They're very sure-footed in rock-scrambling~ although it's heavy to ""scramble"" with a size 14 anything.     I went for the Apex instead of the Alpine because I didn't want to hold in the extra moisture with Gore-Tex.  Even without the GTX~ however~ they were still not too breathable.  So keep them away from hot~ dusty hikes and look for cold mountain meadows.   Great boot."
460,vasque,apex,5.0,   I am amazed at the number of bad reviews I've read for this boot. I have always purchased Vasque boots~ even when they were called Voyagers. My last pair~ which were Hiker II's~ lasted me 24 years~ with several resolings. I think the problem everyone is experiencing is with the initial fitting.  y the way~ purchasing the boots by mail order is not a good idea at all -- no wonder they didn't serve this person well!  The boots must be fitted by someone who knows what they are doing.     Mine were purchased and fitted at Adventure 16 here in Southern California by a QUALIFIED and TRAINED salesperson. The boots hardly needed any break-in and I have worn them on several trips to the Sierra Nevada with absolutely no problems. I have also been snow camping/snowshoeing with them in the local mountains and they have performed admirably! It is also important to have a proper foot liner and to have the proper adjustments made for your type of foot.     Again~ these are excellent boots if they are propery fitted. Most people~ even seasoned backpackers and mountaineers~ don't know the first thing about boot fitting.
461,vasque,apex,3.0,   Purchased first pair from Campmor 2-97 and wore around house for about 4 months to break in. The shoes were very uncomfortable at first but appeared to fit properly. I noticed just before a trip to Colorado in July that the lining had worn through on the inside of one of the boots. I wore it anyway for about 30 miles of day hiking in the mountains and these shoes ate my feet. Worst blisters I've ever had. Being a slow learner~ I patched the worn area with a square of nylon and wore the boots on a two week backpacking trip to Wyoming. The other boot's lining wore through during the trip and they ate my feet again.     I must admit that these boots are very durable and they provide good support and traction. After returning from Wyoming I got in touch with Campmor and they exchanged this pair with the worn liners for new ones. Campmor was very good about this and even refunded the shipping cost. The new pair is much more comfortable and the liner is still intact after several months of light use.     I can't remember all of the construction details of the liner of the first pair~ but I think the liner is constructed differently in this second pair. I have made a real effort to avoid using cotton socks during the break in period and have been checking daily for any balling of the liner and everything looks OK so far. I think that these boots will always require thick socks and tight lacing. Moleskin across the heel is probably a good idea for any uphill with a heavy load.  I don't trust these boots yet~ but I'm not ready to give up. Some of these problems might be common to any type of rigid footwear.
462,vasque,apex,2.0,"   I got the Apex because I wanted a heavy duty boot for backpacking and mountaineering. They accept step-in crampons and I had an OK experience with some Vasque Newbriers. These boots have pros and cons.   Pros - They are tough and provide good support. I have never had a problem with the external construction.   Cons - I have had them for 18 months and they still give me blisters. The inside of the heal is now wearing out and there is no indication that they getting close to being broken in.   My experience with these boots - I spent $200 on the boots and I will spend that much or more on moleskin. I re-apply moleskin every 2 hours. Other people in camp refer to me as ""the guy with no heels"".   Mountaineering IS the art of suffering if you wear these boots."
463,vasque,apex,1.0,   Where do I start with these boots. Nothing but blood~ sweat and tears. I took then on several medium hikes with different sock combinations but nothing seemed to work. The initial fit in the store seemed outstanding. And still to wear them around town they are comfortable. But I put a pack on and start a serious up hill climb and in about 2 miles I can feel the blisters starting. When I thought they might be broke in I hiked the Grand Canyon with them and came out with a bloody mess of a foot. Even after that~ they still are no more broke in then the day I bought them.     I spit on this boot.
464,vasque,apex,2.0,   I bought these boots planning to use them for heavy backpacking in the Rockies. After six months of constant use I still get blisters.   The boots are very waterproof~ sturdy~ and their Vibram soles give great grip on any terrain - but~ if you plan to walk epic distances~ your feet will feel like hamburger. I am currently trying to appeal to Vasque to resolve this dilemma. Generally I have had good luck with their boots~ but do not recommend these to anyone except light alpinists.   P.S.  I am considering One Sport's new norwegian welted boot~ the Mazama. If anyone has information on it~ please post it on the review board.
465,montrail,couloir,4.0,   Overall      Great boot with a solid feel that gives confidence in an array of situations. I have used them on mountaineering trips as well as rock scrabbles up to a 5.8 rating. They take a little getting used to~ but once you get the hang of them they will be your friend for life.   Fit      I wear a size 13 and they were true to fit. They have a wide birth at the toe and a semi secure heel. I do get blisters still to this day after long periods of separation from them~ but that's standard for any full shank boot that I have ever worn.   Weight      It's a full shank~ full leather upper with a bomb proof sole. You are looking at 2 lbs per boot - don't buy these for thru hikes.   Stability      I have very little ankle roll in these bad boys and have hauled packs in excess of 65lbs with little stress.   Durability       I have noticed some wear and tear to the toe box region over time~ especially during crampon season which provokes concerned.   Warmth & Waterproof      If you are climbing in snow~ wear gaiters. If you are at higher altitudes get a pair of down over boots.   Crampon Compatible      Just about any pair of strap on's will work.
466,montrail,couloir,5.0,   Yea! These boots took some breaking in and I did get some blisters early on... but after the break-in boy are these boots great. My Cassin automatic crampons fit just right and the boots are warm even in deep powder snow (wear gaiters). Worked great across the Sierras~ up San Gorgonio~ and up Mt. Shasta. They're going to Mt. Rainier after a few more tune-up trips.   I recommend a nice liner sock with a heavy hiking sock.
467,montrail,couloir,4.0,   These boots fit like they were made specifically for me.  The insole is as good as a new Superfeet~ but I don't know how long it will last?  Over perhaps 30 to 40 hours of use they have broken in until they are very comfortable.  Use two layers of thin socks... not the massively nubby wools~ but smooth ones.  Doing this I never blister and they're a joy to wear.  The break-in period was rough but now they're worth it!
468,montrail,couloir,1.0,"   So I wanted to go backpacking and I let someone else pick out my pair of boots.  A sales representative. BIG MISTAKE! These boots really did some damage to my feet and no combination of socks and/or insoles seemed to help.     #1) The crease in the toe region of the leather wore the tops of my toes to the bone.  #2) My low volume feet slid in the boot (though it was supposedly sized ""perfect for me"") and huge blisters developed on my heels.  #3) Once they were broken in~ I could pull them so tight that my feet lost circulation. Loosening the boots until I could feel my feet~ my feet slid again~ cramming my toes in the toe box on descents.  #4) The boots were not waterproofed from the factory!!!  $240.00 for a boot and you'd expect it to be waterproofed!  #5)  The bootlaces snapped after only 13 days on the trail.   I'd never wear a pair of Couloir's again~ though I've had good luck with Montrail in the past.  Just a bad investment~ I guess."
469,asolo,101,0.0,   I bought a pair of new AFS 101's in the early 1990s but never used them. Recently (May 2008) I started walking in them as part of training for an upcoming climbing expedition. After a couple of walks the soles completely fell off both boots and one of the carbon fibre shanks/sole stiffeners delaminated.   I am currently trying to get them repaired.   Be very careful buying these boots second hand. This problem could have FATAL consequences.   I previously owned and climbed in another pair of 101's and thought they were excellent climbing boots. If not for this problem I would have rated them as 5 stars.
470,asolo,101,5.0,   The Asolo 101s are the best plastic boot that I have used. They fit my feet good and have always felt very comfortable~ whether walking or climbing ice. The snug fit they provide allow a good feel and support while on ice or mixed. The boots always felt light on my feet~ not the clumsy feeling you get with a lot of plastics. Mine are about 11 years old and if they were still available I would definitely buy another pair as mine are at about at the end of the trail.     It seems as though Asolo forgot all of the good things that made the 101 an excellent boot when they produced the Expedition. Even with the roller lacing system it is difficult for me to get a good tight fit. The boots seem clumsy although I have done a lot of ice and mixed in them. The plastic used in the Expedition seems overly thick and not very durable as mine are cracking in back where they fit over the achilles. The material used to seal the tongue on either side has not held up very well as it has worn through in a couple of places. The inners are warm enough for expedion use but seem to hold foot perspiration after several days on an expedition if you sweat like I do.  But the inners also have durability problems~ as an elastic piece that goes across the top of the foot has come unsewn on one of the inners.  These boots are a little over two years old. Recommend? I don't think so.
471,asolo,101,5.0,   I have owned these boots for over four years. I bought them used and have seen other good used versions out there..ie:  IME~ North Conway~ N.H. These boots may be older technology~ but they are the best fitting plasic boots I have ever owned... these are my 4th pair of pastic boots.     They are a little heavy compared to other boots now on the market~ but you cannot beat the performance... or price.  I have had the unfortunate experience of falling into an under snow glacier lake (on the glacier) in Alaska. Needless to say I was soaked... and it was cold out~ 20 deg maybe... but my feet were fine after I dumped out the water. Can't beat that kind of performance.
472,asolo,granite-gv,4.0,"   These boots replaced a pair of La Sportiva Nepals (which are still the best boots I've ever owned). I've walked over 2000 kilometres in the Asolos~ and the only problems I've had are: the stitching down the double seam at the heal coming undone (easily repaired~ but not the best design feature)~ and ripping a couple of the lacing points out).    No ""wear in"" was required for my feet~ and although they are at the end of their useful life now with no tread on the sole~ they are still going well."
473,asolo,granite-gv,5.0,   I bought these as a replacement for a pair of Salomon X-Terra boots that my dog ate. I like a heavy duty boot with a stiff sole for heavy loaded packing (think quarter of an elk at 85#+). These boot really fit the bill.     I have had them about a year and a half now~ and have a couple hundred loaded miles on them~ and a lot more day to day outdoor miles on them. I still miss the X-Terra~ but these are a more comfortable boot at the end of the day.    These are also a nice winter~ and cold weather boot. They have a little more insulation than my other boots had~ and I have worn them in -20F weather on a few occasions. I wouldn't want to stand around for very long in that kind of weather~ but if you are moving~ they work fine.     I am NOT a climber~ so I can't speak to that use~ but I do backpack~ hike~ and pack some very heavy loads. My boots are showing very little wear after more than a year~ and are showing no separation or breakdown that I can tell.    I have a large (13) foot~ but not very wide.  I had a very easy break-in period on these boots. With the design~ I could see how they could be BAD if they did not fit properly. I guess to sum it up~ I LOVE the boots~ but could see how they could be hard to live with if they did not fit your feet.  
474,asolo,granite-gv,1.0,   Had a pair for less than six months an they blew up. The break in was long and painfull a lot like Nicks smoke jumper boots. Unlike Nicks these boots did not stop breaking in they just broke down. Soles seperated and the break down of the boot to the point of very little support for ankles. Poor lacing pattern caused thigh spots and excess leather to build up in the toe box area. There were a real disapointment when comparing them to my old Anapernias.
475,la-sportiva,trango-s,4.0,   Second rewiew after owning and destroying two pairs of these shoes. The main reason not buying a third pair is they are quite short-lived~ even with massive repairs. Sportiva claims they are easy to resole but the time you would resole they are completely decomposed~ mainly due to the poor toetip construction (no toetip reinforcement at all). CAUTION the new model Trango EVO has seemingly the same construction~ although many weak points in the heel/ankle area reinforced.   No insulation whatever~ ideal for dry weather rock climbing. After all they are the Ferraris among shoes: fast light Italian design~ much broken down~ uncomfortable and expensive~ but you never will forget the feeling once they are in movement.
476,la-sportiva,trango-s,4.0,   Walked 200 days in one year since I bought them. In the beginning those were hard days because those boots were rather uncomfortable (one star off!). Did some trimming with scissors and grindstone and they turned out to be very good. Very lightweight allows fast movements. Super stiff~ ideal for hard rock walk/climb/jump. Extremely precise toe/edge feeling. Big ankle freedom allows moves like a climbing shoe. Not waterproof or insulated~ only for good weather. Now they are done and I am going for the next ones.
477,la-sportiva,trango-s,3.0,   This is a very lightweight boot which is crampon compatible because of its little flex. For me this model is neither fish nor fowl~ because it is far too cold for use on ice and definitely not waterproof - after walking half an hour in wet grass my feet were totally soaked~ even though I had sprayed the boots with Nikwax - and for long treks they are  too uncomfortable. What they are good at is climbing in moderately difficult terrain; there they allow very precise steps. But if there is a long approach I will not use these boots again~ because they make your soles burn when you have to go downhill after the climb due to the limited shock absorbing capability~ I guess.
478,la-sportiva,eiger,3.0,"   Only purchased them since they were on sale at Mtn. Gear.   Very high quality in virtually every respect.   Very supportive.  Alleviates cramping of muscles on outside of ankle and outer front shin. Very comfortable and supportive on ascents and very uneven terrain.   Purchased the same size that my Lowa Scout II boots are. Problem is that the Eiger seems to be sized small. Should have gotten a half-size or full-size (euro sizing) larger.  On any descent~ even with the boots laced very tight (proper tightness) to extremely tight (too tight for comfort)~ the big toes (with nails clipped short) still strike the front~ or front-top of the boot. It is not long before dreaded ""black-toe"" results along with significant bleeding if the severe pain is ignored--take it from me! Sometimes you find yourself in a situation where you must keep going. In such situation~ ""black-toe"" is the least of your worries!!         Boot soles are very stifff with no flex--as they are designed to be. They do NOT function well for backingpacking on trails--even trails with many ascents and descents. They are after all mountaineering boots.  Have tried them backpacking with poor results. Since the boots don't flex~ no matter how tight they are laced~ the heel of the foot tries to slide up and down to make up for the lack of flex in the sole of the boot. Eventually~ this takes its toll on the heels of the foot resulting in uncomfortable-to-painful irriatation--minor when compared to the ""black-toe"".   These boots are extremely waterproof (after sealing with the supplied wax). Wading ankle-deep streams is NOT a problem. Feet stayed completely dry--not a drop of water entered the boots.   The standard dry-lex insoles are NOT comfortable--too hard. Have tried a very thin full-length gel sole coupled with a ""Shock-Doctor Ultra"" insole. This works much better.  Using either the thinner standard  Dry-Lex insoles or the thicker combo pair described above~ ""toe strike"" resulting in ""black-toe"" occurred.   Great boot for ascents.     Make sure to get a larger size to avoid ""toe strike"" leading to ""black-toe"";  replace the standard Dry-Lex insoles with your preference; and you have a very nice pair of summer (uninsulated) mountaineering boots. "
479,la-sportiva,eiger,4.0,   Unlike most La Sportiva boots the Eiger breaks in fairly quickly. Prior to these I owned the Karakoram( good boot)! The Eiger seems to be a much easier boot to break in. As far as trail walking goes they work extremly well. Comfort is improved over the Karakoram due to the extensive padding. With crampons this boot is the best Glacier travel boots around bar none! On ice they are good for about 1 pitch unless you own Bionic legs. For edging they do fairly well. Duribility what can you say (BOMBPROOF). The biggest drawback to these boots are weight and lots of it. Size you must have these boots fitted!!!!!
480,scarpa,cerro-torre,4.0,   General impression: This is an extremely versatile boot~ best suited for rugged terrain~ heavy loads~ and some winter travel including steep (though not vertical) ice and snow.    There were two version of this boot made~ I believe the other was called the Thermic and was a stiffer~ insulated version most likely better suited for difficult ice climbing. This yellow version~ the standard Cerro Torre~ has a small amount of flex in the sole allowing for greater comfort on long approaches but weaker performance on steep ice. It is uninsulated~ though still kept my toes comfy down to about 15 degrees F. It took me about 40 miles to break these in~ and it was a tough 40 miles but now they maintain an amazing fit.    Durability is good...only problems I've had are the metallic shoelace eyelets on the ankle breaking off~ and the midsole near the toebox is deteriorating. Also~ after 6 years they just aren't as waterproof as they used to be even with thorough Nikwax treatment. On dry rock they climb exceptionally~ and for moderate to steep ice routes they allow for great sensitivity. The front toe welt is an excellent feature for a boot in this category.   Overall a sweet boot that would get 5 stars but the price is a bit ridiculous. These are discontinued and if you can get hold of a used pair for a reasonable price then go for it!
481,scarpa,cerro-torre,3.0,   It's a beauty to look at~ this yellow/black bee~ but that's only in the shop. Two hours of walking or climbing with it in mud and snow will change that dramatically....It walks excellent on difficult terrain and rock~ gives comfort~ and you can climb with it~ thanks of the rubber toe. The grip on rock is superior but not on wet snow or ice. You can easily put on any crampon on it to help you out.   I had some rust and corrosion on the inside of this boot at the metal parts and the Kevlar outside parts will flush a little.    It's comfortable~ lots of grip on rock~ ready to climb rock or ice with crampons~ not stiff enough to hold long~ a little overpriced. It will support you but gives your moves some freedom too. The lacing system is ok~ they call it speedlacing?    It's a lite boot~ and that count for me.
482,montrail,i.c.e.-9,5.0,   The ONLY downfall of this boot is the crampon recall (and the metal hinge in the arch--which I successfully removed). Otherwise~ this boot is EXTREMELY warm (I suffer from Raynaud's) and perfect for super-wide Hobbit feet. Another reviewer said no crampons were safely compatible... I disagree. The PETZL Charlet (Moser) has worked just fine for me. Not the best boot for vertical ice climbing-- I didn't find it stiff enough. 
483,montrail,i.c.e.-9,4.0,   Bought these boots new off eBay~ along with the ICE 9 crampons and gaiters. Of course the crampons fell off and when I complained to some climbing friends~ I was informed of Montrail's recall. Kudos to Montrail~ they were very helpful about getting me new Grivel Classics~ which I can use on any type of boot (even trail runners). The gaiters are an odd fit and must really be pulled hard to close on top.    Now to the boots...they are great! Very light~ great fit and quite warm for anything I've used them for~ including glacier travel and snowshoeing at -20C. Yes~ the metal studs on the soles used for Montrail's (recalled) crampon system slide on rock so they are coming off soon. I'm sure my opinion would be different if I'd paid full retail - then I'd be looking at La Sportiva.   Update: May 25~ 2008   Since writing my last review in January of 2007~ I've taken these boots to the summit of Aconcagua with a pair of OR insulated gaiters for added warmth.  The boots were fantastic! As these were by far the lightest in our group~ I really enjoyed the descent as well~ being more nimble on mixed terrain than big and clunky double boots.   As with all gear~ I've had to make a few mods: the steel clips for Montrail's failed integrated crampon system were cut off. Also~ their integrated gaiters that clip on the boots remain unused because they are too snug to bother fighting with on the trail. Seems that a great boot was cursed by a bunch of marketing gimmicks!
484,montrail,i.c.e.-9,4.0,   I bought these boots to be my only boot for ice~ mountaineering. So far so good. They are very comfortable with a good heel hold and large toe box. I plan to get new laces that stay tighter longer so I don't have to tighten them when I have crampons and gaiters on.   They are light and comfortable enough to wear on approaches. They have been warm for all glacier and snowshoeing work I've thrown at them. They worked well in Nepal for some friends of friends.   The Ice 9 crampons that were recalled were not well thought out. Montrail replaced them and my Grivel 12 New-matics fit great~ are secure~ and adjust easily. I will get the underfoot nubs ground off. I also did not buy the gaitors- - cute but not necessary.   Overall~ I am pleased with the boot~ and with Montrail's service in general. 
485,montrail,i.c.e.-9,1.0,   Montrail recalled their crampons~ says they're not sure if they will ever reissue. All other crampons I have tried need modifications to work on these boots and then reliablity is in question. Don't buy ICE None. 
486,montrail,i.c.e.-9,4.0,   I recently returned from a trip to Ecuador and used the ICE 9s on a summit attempt of Cotopaxi. The first time I used them on the mountain I could not believe how cold my toes were. Only after returning to the climber's hut did I realize that perhaps I had laced too tightly. On the actual summit attempt~ the boots held up amazingly well. I agree with the reviewer who suggested a legnthy set up time for crampons. I took my time in the months before the trip tinkering with my adjustments~ and had no problems on the mountain.    Overall~ the boots run true to size and are surprisingly comfortable out of the box. I thought I would have to go on a few hikes to break them in~ but after just one trip to a local trail my fears were put to rest. Looking back on the trip~ I probably could have used the ICE 9s as approach footwear on some of the acclimitizing climbs before Cotopaxi. The boots do work a lot like a heavy duty hiker when not fitted with the crampons.     The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that you will need to use something besides your hands to get the crampons off on the mountain. I used my ice axe to pry the back away from the boot. Otherwise~ when properly adjusted~ you'll probably have trouble getting them off wearing gloves~ full gear~ and winter clothing.   Big credit to Montrail customer service too--I ordered a few extra parts for the crampons and they were very helpful in answering questions and getting the parts to me in a short amount of time.
487,montrail,i.c.e.-9,4.0,"   This boot is very comfortable and required no break-in time. Out of the box I did several approaches of 2 miles to 6 miles to get to climbs in temperatures from mid 20's to below 0F and feet stayed very warm~ even while belaying. It does have a much better feel than my plastics and my Salomon Ice&Snow while climbing. They were great on low angled snow and ice and allowed my feet to climb in ""pied canard"" instead of front pointing forever. The low profile feels like it does not give you that stiff foot feel for vertical alpine climbing~ but use the lace system and they hold just fine. I use horizontal crampons for all my climbing and the Khumbu crampons that form fit the boot work great with good secondary front points that are forgiving to my heel lift tendency.   The reason these boots get 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Khumbu crampons are more difficult to put on while all geared up for cold. Also~ the crampons are not very friendly field adjustable -- so make sure they are tight -- tighter than your normal crampons. The adjustment process took about 2 hours as I tried every possible adjustment position. The manual with the crampons is a good starter~ but getting that fine line between too hard to snap and remove and harder than normal took a while.   I purchased the ICE 9 gaiters and bought the recommended size Large for my 10.5 boots and was barely able to get them around the boot. I took them on the climb and was not able to return them to retail shop~ but Montrail took them right back and are in the process of sending me an XL size.   I think this is a great innovation in climbing technology -- which I need as I get older~ stiffer and...."
488,montrail,i.c.e.-9,1.0,   Purchased a pair of the Montrail Ice 9 boots and crampons. While hiking the boots had a tendency to skate on the rocks due to the metal clips on the bottom~ this threw me off balance several times while crossing talus fields. However the worst aspect was the crampon system. Both the right and left crampons came off while crossing the Challenger Glacier in the North Cascades! I immediately took these back to the store for a refund~
489,montrail,i.c.e.-9,3.0,   i purchased the Ice 9 because they claimed it would do well as a all around hiking boot that you could strap crampons on occasionally and use for ice climbing and crossing glaciers.  I needed the Ice 9 wide due to having wide feet.  It felt different than the La Sportiva Makalu and squeezed my pinky toe.  The stainless steel crampon hook on the bottom of it is awkward also while hiking across a boulder field it was like walking on a piece of round pipe and would slip.  the Ice 9 may be fine for just ice climbing but i would not purchase it for an approach or all-around boot like Montrail claims it is. I'm taking mine back tommorrow for a refund.  I guess there is still no all around climbing boot for a wide footed person.
490,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,1.5,   Fell apart after quite moderate usage at the same heel seam that other mention. Such a basic design fault and they cannot have done much product testing at all. I'd avoid La Sportiva in future for that reason — selling a reasonably upper end mountaineering product that hasn't been properly tested is appalling.   Pros   Took a long while to break in and were only moderately comfy till then. However~ just as they're broken in the same heel stitching problem has beset me — they are falling apart. This is after pretty light use~ no more than a dozen days of hiking~ mainly in snow.   They also are not waterproof in prolonged contact (e.g. wet snow)~ which I think is mostly down to the fabric section in the rear.    I'm just glad that I didn't pay the list $375 for them because I'd be livid; instead I'm just p'd off and avoiding La Sportiva in future. Back to Scarpa for me.
491,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,3.0,   My family bought 4 pairs of Glacier EVO's ($265 each) in the last two years~ all about the same time. They have all fallen apart in the heel stitching. We have taken two pair back for one exchange and one credit. I'm on my second pair (exchange) and they are starting to fall apart as well.   I have read the reviews on this web site regarding La Sportiva Karakorums. They apparently fall apart as well. I'm looking at getting credit for my second pair (REI) and getting a different brand as my daughter is as well.    We have not hiked that much to warrant such expensive pairs of boots to fail (all four pairs !!). They fit fine but their quality sucks!
492,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,3.0,"   I bought these boots last winter (2009) hoping to do some light Colorado mountaineering~ some fun scrambles~ and for general backpacking.  After one season of use~ I am a bit unimpressed with the wear and tear.   I did about 25 or so 14ers this past year including the Maroon Bells with the traverse with them and they have a good mix of rigidity and functionality.  While they hold my black diamond crampons rather well and have great grip on my heels~ the negatives are that in temps less than 10 deg~ my toes are always almost frozen~ the tread is already about 2/3 of the way worn down and the stitching is coming undone on the back around my achilles for about 1 1/2"" on each side of each boot that now lets in moisture.  They also give me blisters on my arches when I kick a lot of steps.   I have wide feet and they are a good fit with my true size though which is wierd because La Sportivas are supposed to be narrow.  Good luck!"
493,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,1.5,   I give this boot a bad rating for several reasons.   First~ I thought the initial in store fit was okay. However after several weeks and breaking them in the ankles I noticed was cut for someone with huge ankles. And I have huge calves~ so the eyelets end up touching almost and the boot still isn't tight~ they come undone all the time super annoying. The rubber compound isn't that sticky. Also what was La Sportiva thinking there no lace locking system.   Anyways the kicker is that all boots take awhile to break in and have there little flaws and a lot of them break out. but my boots still cause me pain~ and I had similar stitching issues~ withe the leather and soft neoprene fabric coming undone i haven't even had them a year yet. Boots should last at least a year or two even under hard abuse. Mine was light use.
494,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,4.0,"   I have difficult feet to fit for this sort of boot. One foot is a bit larger~ I have ridiculously narrow heels with a medium width foot overall~ and low arches.   I will say these are quite true to size.    All right~ I've been using these on very steep pitches on uneven/rocky~ and scree terrain. They'll take some more breaking in but here's the good part~ the overall shoe is so stable that I can hit even the tiniest and uneven rock surface on ""toe-point"" and maneuver right up with no slipping off or instability whatsoever~ as the shoe grips and maintains its ""platform"" in the sole very well. Stability on descent seems to be right up there~ as the shoe does what it is meant to do by allowing me to pick correct lines rather than concentrating on trying to keep my own foot and ankle stable...the shoe does that for me.   These are not tennie-like ""day hikers"" per se~ and really are called for only on technical terrain and/or where you might encounter snow fields/glaciers. I have not had a chance yet to use on snow. For general non-technical backpacking/hiking I would not choose these.   There is some heel slippage on steep climbs but so far no blisters/hot spots. Definitely plan on a break in period of several miles. If you have narrow feet~ expect some heel slippage. If you have slightly wider or thicker feet~ expect some pinching across top near the toes until the shoe is broken in. Don't get the regular width if you have quite wide feet.    Overall~ worth the $200 smackers I spent!"
495,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,4.0,   This is the first pair of boots I've ever had that didn't shred my heals. My feet are nearly impossible to fit - 13/14 extra narrow. While I can just barely cinch down the Glaciers EVO's enough to be snug~ they are. I have a pair of 46.5's to keep the volume down and they're a tad short~ but I would have sloshed around in the 47's. The one use for the insole that comes with the boots~ I've found~ is that they're so thin you can use them to add a little extra volume under a quality footbed that you add.   I've been on a number of hikes and climbs with them in the Cascades over the past year and they seem to be holding up very well. They're very comfortable on trails~ but also are great for rock climbing. Great stiffness up front for kicking steps in the snow. I haven't had them out in very cold weather yet~ but judging by how hot my feet get in them I'd imagine they'll be pretty good on Rainier.   Overall: great boots so far~ fifth star would be a little snugger fit for my ankles.
496,la-sportiva,glacier-evo,3.0,   I've been backpacking with those boots in the Rockies all summer long~ so I can tell you the pros and cons of these boots.   At first~ this is a heavy backpacking/light mountaineering booth~ so you have to wear them often before going to any extended trip. When it's done~ they feel really good. Good support~ not too heavy~ and so on...   But after only three weeks of use~ I had a little problem with one of them. The heel/ankle junction started to unstitched. After a couple more weeks~ the other booth started to unstitched at the exact same place. Design problem? Personally~ I think that it is due to the fact that the leather and the black fabric don't work together very well. The leather is probably too rigid for the other fabric.   Since I needed them for the rest of my backpacking trip~ I waited untill early August before I brought them back for warranty service. By that time~ the first boot to unstitched has went a little worse. In fact~ in the last week I've been using them~ the whole area around where the first problem appears collapsed...   La Sportiva thinks I waited too long before I brought them back~ they don't want to warranty them.   Will I buy another pair of booth made by La Sportiva? Ask me!
497,one-sport,couloir,4.0,   These boots have served me well for 3 seasons of Cascades mountaineering.  Unfortunately~ the sole rands are delaminating rather badly now~ especially in the toe area. They are not overly stiff (possibly a result of waterproofing with mink oil -- not recommended)~ but have worked well for occasional ice climbs and front pointing with step-in crampons.  Not especially warm -- downright cold after dark above 10~000 feet. BUT they have gotten me up Ranier twice. If you can get them on sale like I did~ ($165) there is no reason not to get them.
498,one-sport,couloir,1.0,   I am in a bind. I bought these boots because a salesperson touted their high qualities. I didn't need a new pair at the time but this year when I went to use them on two short day hikes they proved to be defective. The rand on one of the toes came completely away from the boot. I bought these at REI in Reading~ MA~ and in speaking with a hiker this weekend was encouraged to return them as REI is said to be a company who wants to remain respected/trusted.  I plan to do so.
499,one-sport,couloir,3.0,   I am very satisfied with the quality~ fit~ comfort and stability of this boot.  The soles have excellent grip and wear.  They have a functional locking lace system.  The ankle is well padded.  I have not used them for serious adventure~ yet~ but have had one small problem.  The 3/4 steel shank has broken at the fore-foot.  It has been a problem functionally and I only occassionally notice a click.  I only weigh 180 and this really shouldn't happen~ especially with such light use.  Otherwise~ I recommend this boot.
500,one-sport,couloir,2.0,   I purchased these boots primarily for hiking.  I weigh about 210 lbs~ and usually have a 50 lb pack.  I needed a stiff because a spur in a joint in one of my toes causes pain if that toes bends much when I walk or hike.  I chose this boot with its 3/4 length steel shank over a rigid boot because I was concerned that my knees might not do well with the stiffer boot.  I've used the boots for about 6 months.   The boots have proven to be generally comfortable from day one. Two problems have developed~ though.  First~ the boot is far more flexible than I expected.  All of the flex is at the end of the shank~ but I'm surprized by how easily the boot does bend.  It's almost like a soft shoe.  The second problem is the crease that forms on the leather above the toe when the boot bends. This crease is deep enough that it presses uncomfortably on to the top of my toes.    The staff at One Sport said that it should improve with age.  Otherwise~ they suggested that I use a leather softener.  The leather softener has not helped~ and I'm not sure that I will be able to tolerate the discomfort long enough verify or disprove their claim.   The boots appear to well constructed.  The difficulties that I am experiencing may be more a result of peculiarities related to my feet than due to inherent short-comings in the boots~ themselves.  However~ I don't think that I could recommend the Couloir to someone of my weight who is looking for a stiff boot.
501,one-sport,couloir,5.0,   These are an exceptional pair of boots.  Though heavy~ they are excellent for long backpacking trips~ mountaineering~ and even general hiking.  These boots have SkyWalk soles which I've found to be extremely durable and they grip absolutely everything.  They are crampon compatible and offer excellent support.  I'd highly recommend these boots and with One Sport quality~ you're sure to have them for many many years.  Happy hiking!
502,asolo,broad-peak-gv,4.0,   Pretty good boot for snow/ice.   Pros   Cons   The Broad Peak GV is a pretty good boot for use on snow or ice. I have used them on Mt Hood~ Mt Shasta~ Mt Rainier~ and for a snow climb on Mummy Mtn near Las Vegas.   They have been great except for the approach hike on Mt Rainier~ which leads up asphalt trails for about a mile~ before reaching the dirt/gravel trails below the Muir Snowfield. Stiff boots do not do well on hard surface trails~ and these are just steep enough that it forces the heel to move around~ which quickly gave me blisters. I stopped near the end of the pavement and applied moleskin~ and put on a second pair of socks — anything to reduce the friction on my heels.   Fortunately~ that did the trick. Once off the gravel trails and onto the snowfield~ the boots were great~ and I had enough traction to cruise up to Camp Muir without even considering putting my crampons on. My feet were never cold on any of my outings~ including some cold/whiteout conditions on the Hotlum Glacier route on Shasta. Nor did they ever get too warm~ even during sunny conditions on Rainier. They have always kept my feet dry as well.   They have both a toe and heel welt~ and work perfectly with my Black Diamond Sabretooth Pro crampons. They lock up tight and the stiffness doesn't allow them to flex off~ even during front pointing or kicking steps.   So if you need a mountaineering boot that is going to be used almost exclusively on the white stuff~ these will be fine. But if you have an extended approach on dirt/rock (or especially on pavement)~ you might want to consider carrying some approach shoes~ or pick a more forgiving boot.
503,asolo,broad-peak-gv,2.0,   Blisters yes. These boots are the right length and seam to fit~ but my heels get blisters.   I use them for ice climbing. Now I hike with other boots and carry them in my pack. I really only use them for vertical climbs. I am thinking about selling them on ebay since they are like new.   I am going for the Kaylands next since my Kayland hiking boots are so awesome. Sorry for the bum review.
504,asolo,broad-peak-gv,5.0,   I read the previous review and I don't think it's fair to rate a boot poorly simply because it doesn't fit you well. I've had these boots over a year~ have put well over 250 miles on them~ used them on snow~ ice~ rock~ and dirt.    They're fine on trails (a little stiff though)~ excel on class 3 or 4 terrain~ and have been fantastic on steep snow (couloir) climbs here in Colorado.  I've used these boots for just about everything and have really tested them on some tough terrain and have not a single complaint~ not to mention I've never even gotten a hot spot let alone a blister.    Fit is different than performance~ this boot performs very well in a variety of conditions~ and has proven to be durable~ with a nice sticky sole~ great ankle support~ and great crampon compatibility.  I love this boot.   
505,asolo,broad-peak-gv,2.0,   I have a mid volume foot~ size 9 and medium width. This is the 4th pair of Asolo boots I've had. FSN 95~ Fugitive and Distance. Asolo boots have fit my foot better than anything else. I climbed the Grand Teton in my FSN 95's. Love their fit.   I bought the Broad Peaks to wear when I go climb Rainier this July. I bought them for the fit that has been great~ they look like they could take a beating and I've just had plain great luck out of Asolo boots.   I've got about 25 miles on these boots now. I hiked up Mt Sterling in GSMNP this past weekend. I have not had a hike where I didn't end up with at least 2 blisters on my feet. I currently have 5. I don't understand what is going on. I've used liner socks~ custom footbeds~ moleskin... these boots are chewing my feet up every time I wear them!    I'm really disappointed with the fit. Now I'm going to have to get new boots or rent. $280 down the drain.
506,montrail,lotus-gtx,3.0,   Great concept in a light and flexible boot. Very comfortable overall. Great for long approaches. Not insulated~ so they need a toe heater in colder weather.   The Gore-tex failed. They recalled the crampons too~ but Montrail was very helpful with all of this.   I would not recommend this boot. Better wait until they introduce a new version. 
507,montrail,lotus-gtx,3.0,"   The Gore-Tex liner was a complete failure despite negligible use~ which is why the rating is low. In addition the rubber rand separated with less than 20 miles backpacking on smooth maintained trails.   The rating is higher than ""1"" or ""2"" because the boots perform reasonably well--as long as you ignore the fact that they leak like a sieve~ don't mind paying extra for the Gore-Tex~ and don't mind gluing the rand back where it separates.   Pros:   Light weight~ good sole~ good balance between weight~ rigidity~ and support.  Carbon insole performs well~ but not perfectly.   Probably good warranty and customer service.   Cons:      I purchased these boot specifically due to the Gore-Tex lining.  The Gore-Tex failed miserably in the first use with wet conditions. To verify~ I filled the dry boots with water and they leaked like a sieve.  On the positive side~ the Montrail warranty department appears to bending over backwards to deal with the boot~ but the bigger issue is quality control--plus the hassle of breaking in yet another pair of boots while wondering if they too will fail.   The integral cleat was filed off because it hinders traction (slides on rock surfaces) and is noisy.  If you aren't going to use the matching crampon~ you won't want the cleat.   I'd prefer a little more support~ but again~ these provide an interesting combination of light weight with adequate support and good traction."
508,merrell,vertical,4.0,   i had no comfort issues at all with these boots. i think sometimes that is just a matter of chance and how your foot is shaped. however i did have the same problem with a hook breaking off. that was just sad. i figured it could only happen to me but apparently not.    that being said~ the actual performance has given me nothing to complain about. of course like any other boot in this class~ you take it off and feel like you just took 5 pounds of weight off. because you did.
509,merrell,vertical,1.0,   If you LOVE heel blisters and sore ankles~ buy this boot. To be fair~ the boots do have a nice firm platform for climbing~ but don't lock your heel down nearly well enough for the use. Another major gripe is the use of plastic in the heel. Plastic! Not quality plastic either~ but what you'd expect to find in your son's toy army man.     Anyway~ there is no padding between the layer of non-flexible plastic and the inner leather lining~ so heel blisters are an ever present reality.  It's too bad too~ because it seemed like Merrell had a decent idea with these shoes~ but they just got cheap in materials and construction (I had a lacing hook break off while trying to tighten the boot so my heel wouldn't raise too much).    Promptly returned the boots to REI after a three-week sentence~ and have set out with some Sportiva Nepals~ which are much superior.  Buy at your own risk -- only thing Merrell makes worthwhile are the mocs.
510,garmont,epic-karbo-gtx,1.0,"   On the positive side: The boots are very light~ but still rigid~ and well suited for crampons. They are relatively narrow~ which makes them a perfect fit on my extremely narrow heels. I had an extremely positive feeling in the boots when moving upwards~ both over snow / ice and over rocks.   On the negative side: The boots take a long time to dry once they get wet. And now the real downside: The boots seem to have a faulty design for moving downwards. Actually~ when going down quickly~ I had several instances when one foot was twisted outwards. At some occasion it happened with such a force that I twisted my ankle. After the tour was over I went to the doctor~ who sent me to an orthopedic shoemaker. The shoemaker diagnosed immediately the shoes are wrongly designed: They are getting more and more narrow towards the sole of the shoe~ producing a kind of ""high heel effect"". The shoemaker demonstrated to me in an effectful way how easily the shoes get twisted~ also in comparison to other mountaineering boots.     I think it's a shame and very dangerous that a mountaineering boot from the well known Garmont brand has such a design flaw. Has any one else had similar problems?    I had to stop my mountaineering vacations due to the damaged ankle. And by the way: According to some research over the phone and Web~ it seems that this boot is out of market already (at least in Europe). Maybe connected to these problems?"
511,garmont,epic-karbo-gtx,4.0,   I'm fortunate enough to have only paid 270 NZD for these boots which are not normally sold in NZ.   I've been using them for about two months now mainly on Mt Ruapheu In NZ north Island. They have been great for ice climbing with an really stiff sole from the carbon fibre shank. Really good for post and pigeon holing in all hardness of snow.   However the cuff has taken a bit of a battering from rubbing on my gaiters and is looking a little frayed. The Vibram sole gives good grip on snow and the Gore-tex liner has lept my feet dry~ however the lack of insulation makes for cold toes if stood instructing for any length of time.   The boots take crampons well and the rubber rand shrugs off rocks and crampon points. Impressively stiff nice and light.   But a bit chilly to stand around in.
512,la-sportiva,olympus-mons,2.0,   My experience with this boot is as a mountaineering ranger on Denali.   I have gone through two pairs of Olympus Mons boots in three climbing seasons.  The zippers have a tendency to come apart and both pairs had problems with the soles separating.   Unfortunately these problems didn't present themselves until their second expeditions respectively (approximately 25 days each) which meant the boots were older than one year.  La Sportiva has the worst customer service I have ever encountered~ and if the boot is older than one year they will not entertain any idea of repair or replacement.   The boots cost too much for the problems that arise.  This issue~ coupled with the poor customer service~ has compelled me to return to my tried and trusted Invernos: just as warm with overboots and not too much heavier.  If you have to have this boot pay particular attention to the zippers and exercise caution attaching step-in crampons.
513,la-sportiva,batura,4.5,   I have used these shoes too short to give a decent review. But I don’t want you to withhold what I have experienced so far.    No real break in time form me.    Rock climbing is for me possible/doable up to 5.10. The contact with the rock is accurate. The sole/rubber is for a big boot narrow~ that’s why. Strange enough the toe box is quite wide. So no cold toes. Ice and mixed up to M5 went okay. No movement in the heel part. Used them with Simond Makalu and Grivel Rambo 4. Both fit and work fine.      Once they are wet~ they dry slowly. Really slow!    How do they get wet?   Sweat from the inside and . . . from the outside.   The first fact is easy to eliminate use an aluminum derivate deodorant on your feet every day for a week before you climb. So no sweat~ nice and warm feet.    On the approach in Scotland I stepped in a snow covered creek up to the ankle. I thought (past time) nice! this high gaiter keeps the water out. The gaiter does but the zipper leeks. So your safety margin is rather small compared to a ‘classic’ boot. The zipper starts low~ see picture. Think also of wet snow.   To say it indiscriminate: People who tell you that this is an ideal winter boot for the lower ranges~ like Scotland~ don’t know what they are talking about.    Is the shoe to blame? No. Once high or cold enough they work perfect.    The outside is sturdy so far. No visible scratches or crampon holes :-).   Then the weight … are they so light weight as promised? Not on my scale. My Scarpa Cumbre’s weigh the same on my scale (same size). The Cumbre is supposed to be heavier. I cannot tell which one is warmer. There is a difference in warmth~ but I didn’t notice it until now.    Would I recommend the shoe? Yes~ and I would also say that there are also other very good shoes out there as stable as these.
514,la-sportiva,batura,0.0,   Batura is a perfect boot~ i have never believe that ever i will have almost ideal boot. of course it is a waterproof~ is warm how much you need~ is too light~ is too beautiful.   i have never believe that a gaiter like this can do a job of a gaiter but it work perfect. so everything is good~ except RIRI ZIP~ that zip is the WORST thing that is made of LA SPORTIVA. actually is not made of La Sportiva~ is Riri~ but unfortunately the La Sportiva have believe to RIRI.   i have used my Batura just 5 times. at last time i have climbed a 2500m peak and wen i saw in evening that the part of ZIP is destroyed i became too sad~ and I admonish the climbers who want to buy batura~ please wait till La Sportiva change the ZIP partner.
515,asolo,expedition,2.0,   The Asolo 101's are the best plastic boot that I have used.  They fit my feet good and have always felt very confortable~ whether walking or climbing ice.  The snug fit they provide allow a good feel and support while on ice or mixed.  The boots always felt light on my feet~ not the clumsy feeling you get with a lot of plastics.  Mine are about 11 years old and if they were still available I would definetly buy another pair as mine are at about at the end of the trail.     It seems as though Asolo forgot all of the good things that made the 101 an excellent boot when they produced the Expedition.  Even with the roller lacing system it is difficult for me to get a good tight fit.  The boots seem clumsy although I have done a lot of ice & mixed in them.  The plastic used in the Expedition seems overly thick and not very durable as mine are cracking in back where they fit over the achilles.  The material used to seal the tongue on either side has not held up very well as it has worn through in a couple of places.  The inners are warm enough for expedion use but seem to hold foot perspiration after several days on an expedition if you sweat like I do.  But the inners also have durability problems~ as an elastic piece that goes across the top of the foot has come unsewn on one of the inners.  These boots are a little over two years old.  Recommend?  I don't think so.
516,asolo,expedition,1.0,   I bought this boot last year. The main problem is that this boot will never fit. This is not only my opinion~ many of my friends tried this kind of boot and they experienced the same. Whenever I used them my shinbone become painful. The membrane at the tongue and the inner-boot seams got ruined after several uses.
517,asolo,expedition,2.0,   Asolo screwed up when they changed from the black w/ yellow '94 Expedition. The only change for the better was the use of pulleys which allow you to really crank down and tighten these boots~ which you can easily overtighten.    The old model fit perfectly. The new Asoflex-Trifusion model never fit me well. The inner boot was tight and didn't lace up - it used elastic. It had annoying plastic reinforcing which I'm sure has no function inside the shell other than to take up space. These boots were brutal on my shins - very stiff - and squeezed my right foot. I wear a 10.5 D and these boots were too narrow. To top it off~ I used them for a season~ once a week~ and the gusset wore through where it was pinched between the tounge and the boot. If you can wear these comfortably in the store while walking around for two hours~ and you want a super-stiff boot~ and you have thin feet~ and you have $450 laying around~ get 'em~ otherwise look for something else.
518,salewa,wildfire-gtx,5.0,"   Grip like no other shoe I've owned. A touch narrow~ but still very comfy~ and did I mention grip?   Pros   Cons   A review in two parts   Part 1 - My review after the first day:   I just received these in the mail and put them on. They are very comfortable and very true to size. I always wear a EUR 43 (I've given up on US sizes) and these fit me perfectly (US size 10 in this case).   They are darker black than I expected from the photo where they look more grey—but they are still pretty sharp looking. The red laces really pop nicely. The cloth is grey; but the black trim really dominates the appearance.   The tongue is very comfortable. It's a little odd looking before you put it on but feels really nicely on my foot.   The toe cap is really nice and solid. I'm pretty hopeful it will hold up well on the trail and the disc golf course. It is a little odd when you're looking straight down on it because it sort of covers just half of the top of the shoe.   The grip seems pretty good. I walked around on some marble tile and they grip pretty well. I'm hopefully that translates well to slicker rocks on the trail.Part 2 - One month in   After having worn these on very loose soil on really steep embankments~ on wet rocks and crags~ and a variety of surfaces in between I can say these have the best grip of any shoe I've ever worn. I have never felt more confident on the trail than I do in these shoes.   On the flip side they are a tiny bit narrow. Not as an narrow as say an Adidas shoe~ but narrow enough that my right foot notices it if I'm sitting still for a while. I imagine that will loosen up over time but for now it it's an issue if I wear them to work.   The ankle area is a little high too so the curvy bit that swoops under my ankle bone tends to annoy my left ankle when my left foot is on the high side on a trail. Not enough to get me to not wear them (that grip!) but a long day of walking on uneven terrain could really cause my ankle some grief.   The lacing system is a little different than other shoes and that first lace at the bottom~ if it isn't tight enough~ can catch loose sticks. So make sure you snug that one in place even if you want the rest of the shoe laced a little loosely.Even with the niggles I have I'd buy these again. They are the first Salewa shoes I've owned but I'm blown away by the grip. The shoe is also great quality and the water proof is~ so far~ truly proof (I know it's Gore-Tex but I seem to have hit-or-miss Gore-Tex experiences). I'm very happy with this purchase and have recommended them~ in person~ to others.   I wear them disc golfing as well and they are great shoes for all the different elements you might find on the course.   I don't know what they put in the ""Pomoca Speed MTN rubber compound"" sole~ but I feel like a mountain goat when I'm wearing them.Here is a good view of the tread on these beasts:"
519,salewa,wildfire-gtx,4.5,   This shoe is everything you want it to be~ plus a little more. The fit is great and it's very comfortable. Like hiking on clouds. The shoe is also very multifunctional as it can be used for major backpacking trips to day trips to just wearing it around with a pair of jeans.   Pros   I love this shoe. I have had it now for about a month and it's everything I hoped it would be when I ordered them. From the minute I put them on they felt like they were made for my foot. I have taken them out on several hiking trips now and they never cease to amaze me. I have gone from the Merrell Moabs~ which I thought were going to be the most comfortable hiking shoe I ever owned~ until I got my pair of Wildfires.   They required no break-in time~ which is a guarantee from Salewa. If you receive a blister they will refund you. The technology they put into the lacing system and overall shape of the shoe is on point. I have the GTX so they have the Goretex lining. Still breathable and my feet do not overheat.   I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a nice sturdy shoe with a sharp look.
520,vasque,pingora,4.5,   The Vasque Pingoras were designed as technical approach shoes~ and as that they work great. They are very supportive~ stable and protective~ definitely more so than than many mid-top light hiking boots~ not to mention trail runners. The overall tread pattern is fairly flat~ designed for grip on rock with a minimum of tread squirm. Also~ this enables the Pingoras to smear fairly well for something that isn't a climbing shoe~ which is likely a function of the always excellent Stealth tread compound (a variation of climbing shoe rubber). In addition~ there is a well-defined inside edging platform on the forefoot that works decently (which is somewhat shocking since I sized these shoes like a light hiker~ not a climbing shoe) if you cinch down the forefoot with the to-the-toes lacing.  The existence of a real heel (or rather~ the gap before the heel) is also very helpful when you're rock-hopping on sharp-topped rocks~ as the gap before the heel hooks onto a rock angle and allows you greater freedom to maneuver (assuming one has the foot stability/strength to not wreck one's ankle~ hehe).   I've used them in the course of lightweight backpacking~ cragging approaches~ low-angle easy climbing~ and wet/dry canyoneering involving stemming.   Downsides?  They're too heavy to work as true trail runners~ but they do run in a pinch. They're not the smoothest runners around~ but they certainly are stable. The flat-ish tread pattern is not well-suited for loose dirt~ nor loose-dirt-on-rock. The lack of any mesh makes the shoes less breathable than it could be~ and slower to dry. OTOH~ the lack of mesh is possibly a reason for the shoes' stability~ and the synthetic material dries much faster than leather. Finally~ the ankle pad material is not as bomber as the rest of the shoe.  On mine~ the inside is all chewed up~ presumably from shoe-to-shoe abrasion. That said~ it does not affect functionality.   I would buy another pair after these wear out~ especially considering how cheap they can be found.  They're great at MSRP~ a steal otherwise...  assuming your intended usage matches what they're good for.
521,vasque,pingora,5.0,   I've owned a bunch of approach shoes over the years from a number of companies~ but these have become my favorites. FiveTen stealth rubber is the best. And these have it. I've always had problems with FiveTen shoes both in terms of fit and quality. My Pingoras fit me perfectly~ and they are built to last.    They are a bit beefier than some approach shoes. These are geared more towards hiking and climbing than trail running. You wouldn't really want to try to do any real running in these. But they climb really well for a sneaker~ and they hold up well on long hikes with a pack full of climbing hardware. They have full leather uppers and do not breathe as well as some nylon mesh shoes~ but these will hold up much longer and they protect your feet a lot better.
522,evolv,cruzer,4.5,   Cheap~ versatile~ great value.   Pros   Cons   A great alternative to expensive burly approach shoes. the Cruzer is great for everyday use as it isn't flashy or bad taste. It climbs quite well~ including edging. It is also pretty good for belaying as the heel folds down.   Because it's so low profile and light it is perfect for descents while climbing with it on your harness. It does not last that long though~ especially if you use it around town. Plus canvas isn't waterproof or anything and some people don't like it on a shoe.    They lasted a couple of years until the sole started to come of.    Other than that I really recommend them.
523,evolv,cruzer,4.5,   Great for what I wanted. Not terribly stylish~ they look like TOMS. I'm replacing 5.10 Guide Tennies with these. There is a lot less shoe here than the 5.10.   Pros   Cons   I ride my mountain bike to work and like to have a sticky sole to grab onto my bike pedals. But I also need something that doesn't look out of place in a tattoo shop.   These are a simple shoe that are like a very comfortable version of my climbing slippers. They give me very good control on the pedals because there's not a lot between your foot and the ground/pedals/rock. The footbed has a nice amount of padding though~ which seems weird. It would seem you could have one but not both.    The sole is sticky~ but not too sticky. There's no squeak when walking on an interior floor. I have taken them out for a little bit of scrambling on some boulders near my house~ and they performed more than adequately.     If I were going to be climbing in them I would want them to lace to the toe~ but this isn't a problem for my intended use. All the other reviews I read of them made me think that sizing would be a problem~ I wear an 11 1/2 in most shoes and these don't do half sizes past 11 and they stop at 12. I got the 12 and they fit great.   Again if I were climbing in them I think I would want a half size smaller.    Update 4/2016: Now that I've had these awhile I'll add more more to my initial impressions. The more I wear them~ the more I love them. I started wearing them when I play the drums. I get tons of control on the kick pedal without them being too sticky. When we play shows we dress up in semi-formal attire. Because these are all black they don't look funky while wearing a suit.   On most of my outdoor shoes I change the laces to accessory cord. Because I wear these while bike commuting I end up riding on city streets at night. I found accessory cord that has silver threads. This helps make me more visible~ but this cord is very stiff so they were coming untied all the time. So I cannibalized some cord locks from an old REI down jacket.   I threaded the accessory cord through these cord locks and viōla~ problem solved.     Some friends and I are in the process of scouting out short faces and boulders to climb (we're in a part of the country with NO known climbing since the ground is mostly clay and the closest gym is 70 miles away) find these will not be my scouting shoes; I need proper off-trail boots since we'll be hiking around in trail less acres of Missouri River bluffs. The Cruzer will be in my pack so I can throw them on and try some moves on whatever rocks we do find. 
524,evolv,cruzer,4.0,   This is a great casual shoe that also does quite well on the approach. It is very comfortable to wear all day~ and very lightweight on harness or in the pack.   Pros   Cons   I have used this shoe for two summers in Europe and for everyday casual use for two years. In that time I have gone through two pairs.   I got this shoe to replace Sanuks~ my previous casual shoes which the sole came off of in Vidin province of Bulgaria (ie the poorest/most remote/least industrialized region of the poorest/least industrialized country in Europe). I wasn't going to let that happen again~ traipsing through the Balkans in duct tape soled shoes.   I got these shoes when I returned in the 'slate' color. Evolv has been having problems with this canvas fabric changing color~ and when they began turning a light-purple-going-orange type of color from a few months of Arizona sun. I returned these and got a new pair.   The new pair was the same but the color did not fade. The shoe was comfortable~ (fits a little bit snug and narrow~ I usually go 12 or 45.5 in Scarpa casual shoes in casual shoes for a tight fit and take a 13 in these). I picked the shoe mainly becuase of how it looks~ simply and low profile. The toe rand looks a little odd and people ask what type of shoes they are~ but many people compliment them. The two-part tongue design it excellent~ as it doesn't go to the side like most of my other shoes. The rubber sole grips very well~ but does mark and wear quickly.   The shoes have a pretty minimalist design. They are lightweight and pretty basic construction. Rubber sole~ foam cushion and footbed~ foam insole~ lined canvas upper.   The first pair was great~ but for summer 2013 I got a new pair because the old ones were getting to be pretty well used.   The new pair has also been great~ but it is beefed up a little since the first model. The differences are it has a dual density insole and the lined canvas upper has a foam between the lightweight inner liner and canvas. It is slightly heavier but not noticeable~ and it holds its shape better than the old model~ which had little structure in the upper.
525,salewa,mountain-trainer-gtx,4.5,"   Superb updated lightweight hiker from Salewa. Comfortable out of the box~ little break-in required. Many adjustment options to fashion a perfect fit.   Pros   Cons   This is the new updated 2015 Mountain Trainer Mid GTX from Salewa. Nice looking and distinctive. Color is brown nubuk with silver~ yellow and red sole trim.   The ""to-the-toe""  lacing system is a plus not usually found in a regular hiking boots and allows you to dial in a perfect surround fit. There are two sets of double layer insoles (the extra set is found in a plain white box in the packaging—don't toss this accidentally!) so you should find a comfortable width option whether you have a somewhat wider or narrower foot.   Boot is lightweight with a firm and sturdy outsole~ seems to grip well so far. Only downside is a somewhat stiff and thinly padded upper~ but this has not proved a liability so far in actual hiking."
526,salewa,mountain-trainer-gtx,4.5,   I am a seasoned boot user~ but after reading a number of opinion blogs I thought I would try a hiking shoe. The Salewa Mountain Trainer has turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.       While not as comfortable on my foot as my Aslo boots are~ they have proven to be a very solid shoe and I really appreciate the lighter footwear compared to my boots.   The shoe fits great. While it did require a good deal of time to break in~ the shoe is relatively comfortable now.   I have about 100 miles on the shoes now and I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone.
527,salewa,mountain-trainer-gtx,4.0,   The Salewa Mountain Trainer GTX is a comfortable~ exceptionally-made if somewhat pricey all-around hiking shoe. Appearance~ fit~ comfort and utility combine to make this an ideal choice for active hikers with larger budgets.    Pros   Cons   Fit: As with any shoe~ especially hiking shoes that will take a beating and need to protect one's feet~ the Salewa fits quite well. I wear a size 11 shoe~ whether it's casual~ work or exercise and the Salewa fit perfectly. When I walk I am always conscious of the fit across the instep~ the heel cup and the insole. The Salewa is great in all three categories.   Most of my walking/hiking is done on urban trails with few~ if any~ little technical details. For years I have used Saucony or Asics trail runners. I notice that the heal cups wear out quickly~ the heel wears down and it's sometime difficult to get a comfortable fit across the instep.   With the Salewas~ one of the fist things I noticed was the well-finished heel cup. I've been wearing them only for a week~ but my heel doesn't move around much so I think these will last. Also~ the insole is a two-piece design with excellent cushioning.   I do suffer from plantar fasciitis and~ while support and cushioning are comfortablle~  there is not as much arch support as those shoe brands that promote this feature. It should be noted that Salewa makes no mention of arch support~ etc.~ so this is NOT a knock against the shoe. Lastly~ the padded tongue and thick laces provide a secure~ comfortable fit.   Comfort: I immediately noticed two things when I laced up my shoes. First the shoes are solid and heavy. Not an ideal shoe for quick movement. As I said~ I'm used to lightweight trail runners~ so the additional weight takes some getting used to. Although it's cut like a standard athletic shoe~ it weights more like a mid-cut boot.   The second thing I noticed was the SOLID construction. This shoe feels like it's built for mountaineering! The sole is solid and grippy. No lateral foot movement~ sliding in the heel cup~ etc. One feels like one can literally go climb a mountain in these. The toe box is rooming and no pinching even with thinker light weight hiking socks. Not sure how a very thick heavy-weight sock would fit as I haven't tried that yet. There still a bit stiff because they are so new.   Support: As noted above~ support and fit are excellent. This is a low-cut shoe~ so I'm not looking for a lot of ankle support~ but the shoe is solid and I would feel comfortable bouldering or scrambling over scree.   Water Resistance: If it's designed to keep your feet dry~ does it?   Traction: This shoe is the GTX model~ so I think it's designed with wet conditions in mind. So far so good. the Vibram sole is stiff and grippy and designed for technical mountaineering conditions. The lugs are not so large that one feels like one is wearing waffle-stompers or that small pebbles etc. will get caught in the treads.   Temp Control: So far so good. I've worn them in humid mid-70s weather and low 50s. She shoes are comfortable and my feet are warm and DRY without over-heating. I suspect that in very hot conditions the shoe may heat up because of the solid~ water-proof construction. Definitely the opposite of the lightweight~ breathable trail runners I usually wear.   Ease of Use: The shoes are easy to put on and lace up. No complicated lacing system here. My only complaint is that the very-simply eyelet system makes it hard to get a truly customized fit across the entire foot. That said~ there is some give and I think they could be cinched up pretty tight.   Features: The two noteworthy features are the GTX (waterproof) and solid construction. As noted above~ these are made like mountaineering boots. Surprisingly~ the sole and toe box appear somewhat narrow (maybe because I'm used to a wider trail running shoe). However~ there shoe fits very comfortable. I usally size up a half size in my street running shoes to accommodate my toes. No pinching in the Salewas which run true-to-size.   Construction & Durability: These shoes are built for mountains. The sole is tough and durable~ as are all parts of the upper. They look and feel like they could easily withstand tough~ technical mountain/trail terrain. I really like the hardened finish around the toe and along the bottom of the shoe wear the sole meets the upper. Clearly constructed with the intent to withstand sharp~ gravelly trail conditions.   Conditions: As stated above~ I've had these for a week and worn them only walking/hiking on urban trails with few technical conditions. I've walked through dewy morning fields and the GTX waterproofing is impeccable.   Final Remarks: This is a stylish well-made shoe. I originally bought the acid-green but exchanegd them for black because I wear them to work in an urban environment and the green was little too much for my style. If I bought these only for extreme outdoor use~ I would have stuck wiht the bright color. These are an ideal shoe for someone with the budget for a sturdy~ waterproof technical mountain approach/hiking shoe. I'm really happy with my purchase.
528,la-sportiva,tx4,5.0,   The TX4 is a well-made approach shoe~ probably the most comfortable shoe I have worn. It performed well on my 60 miles of hiking local hills and in climbing at two local areas. It might be a bit narrow for those with wide feet.       The TX4 is best for people doing long approaches~ including trail hiking and scrambling~ along with moderate technical climbing.   Pros   Cons   Background: At the top of the list of gear for anyone venturing into the woods and hills~ whether a day hike~ climbing~ or backpacking is what you wear on your feet. In my many decades of outdoor activities~ I have had footwear that ranged from miserable to wonderful. Much of that footwear has been single purpose~ designed for a very narrow range of activities—specialized rock shoes and heavy boots for use on snow and ice with crampons or for skiing.   The specialized shoes for climbing are generally very uncomfortable to wear on an long approach trail. But the shoes we used to wear on the approaches often were not suitable for even simple scrambling. In recent years~ with many approaches themselves covering remote and somewhat technical terrain~ lighter weight shoes have been designed to deal with moderately technical terrain.   These approach shoes have seen some significant improvements~ enabling their use on moderately technical climbs. Approach shoes have also made the exit hikes a lot more comfortable. They are light enough to clip to your harness or stick into a day pack when you change to your technical rock shoes or heavy double boots to be worn on glaciers or ice climbs.   A number of years ago~ at the American Alpine Club’s Climbers Ranch in Jackson Hole~ I arranged a climb of the Exum Direct with another climber. I expected to swap leads for the full length of the route and get a chance to rest my feet a bit on the descent~ and so wore my rock shoes for the full climb. On the 3rd pitch~ my partner informed me he was not up to leading his share of the pitches~ leaving me to lead  the remainder of the 2000 feet or so to the summit~ including a couple of 5.9 detours to pass slower climbers. Because of some thunderclouds to the north~ we descended fairly rapidly by the standard  rappel route to our tent at the saddle~ by which time my feet were really hurting in my rock shoes. I wanted to camp for the night~ but my partner insisted he had to be back in Jackson. At least I had my hiking boots for the hike back to the car through the boulder field~ mostly in the dark with fading batteries in my headlamp (my partner had dead batteries in his lamp).   I have certain expectations for any gear I am going to use. For approach shoes~ I expect the following:   First Impressions: I had just arrived home from our expedition to Japan and Mongolia (trip report at https://www.trailspace.com/forums/trip-reports/topics/171028.html) when the doorbell rang. I opened the door and the FedEx guy handed me a box with a pair of La Sportiva TX4 approach shoes~ Euro size 42 (US size 9) in it. Since I was just off the plane after crossing the International Date Line from West to East in a 5664 mile~ 10.5 hour flight~ I put off opening the box until I could get a good night’s sleep.   The next morning~ I opened the box to find the “papaya and yellow” colored TX4 shoes (that is what the description in the box says the color is). The design of the shoe is very similar to the La Sportiva Boulder and Boulder X approach shoes I have used over the past 10-12 years~ both having a leather top like the TX4. I have re-soled the Boulder at The Rubber Room in Bishop~ Calif. My more recent Boulder X has some stitching that has worn through from rubbing in jam cracks.   The TX4 is one of a family of TX shoes (TX2~ TX3~ TX4) with the Vibram MegaGrip Traverse outsole.   I quickly put on a pair of hiking socks and put the shoes on. I was delighted by the very comfortable fit~ almost like they have been custom made for me. I will have to say~ though~ that the color scheme does not thrill me. But then~ the last couple of running shoes I have bought from companies whose shoes fit me well are offered now only in colors that also do not thrill me.   OTOH~ it only takes a little hiking on the dusty trails we have during the current drought to conceal the brightness of the color scheme. The photo was taken after a 10-mile~ 2300 foot altitude gain “approach” hiking one of the local hills.   The shoes weigh 1p10.5oz/754 gm for the pair. The suggested price is $135. The shoe is to be in stores Spring 2016.   The TX4 after a couple hikes on dusty mountain trails   The shoe bottom of “sticky rubber”~ made by Vibram~ has numerous small round “cleats” with a depression in the middle of each “cleat” (bit of trivia – Vibram is the name of the company formed by Vitale Bramani in 1935 to manufacture boot soles for climbing boots~ with the rubber lugs being shaped much like the nails used on climbing boots of the time).   I noted that the TX4 has a slight heel (about 1 cm high)~ with a gap under the arch where there are no “cleats”. On all my other approach shoes~ the full sole is flat. The only advantage I can envision is that the resultant gap on the TX4 might stay in place better in an etrier.    The sticky rubber sole - note the pattern difference of lugs between front and heel~ with the heel slightly raised   Note that on the toe section of the sole in the photo~ is a label that indicates where the smooth “Climbing Zone” is located.   In walking around our house and on stairs in some locations the pattern on the main sole area provided very good grip.   In the photo below~ note the loop on the heel. This serves two purposes. First is the obvious aid to pulling the shoe on. Less obvious is that when you pull hard on the loop~ you tighten the “tech” cord that reinforces the lacing loops (my guess is that it is Dyneema or a similar synthetic).   Done correctly~ this is intended to help stiffen the sole for edging and help in smearing on the “Climbing Zone” along with reducing the amount of sliding of your foot inside the shoe. I would have liked better tightening of the laces toward the toes for climbing~ though the TX4 still performed well on climbs.      Details of testing: I put on a pair of Injinji toe socks (what I use these days either as a liner or by itself for hiking~ climbing~ or long walks) and put the shoes on. Usually~ I replace the original insole in any new boots with Superfeet. As mentioned above~ the TX4's fit perfectly~ with the supplied liners providing the right amount of support. It wasn’t really a surprise~ though~ since I have found over the years that boots by the Italian makers~ La Sportiva and Scarpa~ usually fit me well enough so I can buy them pretty much by size. This has been true for ski boots (downhill and telemark) and expedition (single and double~ as well as the Olympus Mons).   The “last” that these companies use is close enough to my foot for comfort (the “last” is the foot-shaped block that a boot or shoe is designed and built around by the manufacturer for each size). There are boots from other companies that have excellent reputations that just plain do not fit me~ even though the nominal size and width is my measured foot. It is important when fitting any footwear to find which companies use a last close to your foot shape.   I also did a bit of pulling on the heel loop~ and did find some effect in stiffening the sole. It remains an approach shoe and is not a substitute for a dedicated rock shoe. Still~ it worked well for scrambling on approaches.   My intention was to put at least 100 miles of “approach” on the shoes~ plus do a few climbs at a couple of climbing areas. Here in California~ we are blessed with a wide variety of rock types within a short distance~ plus plenty of hiking trails. As it turned out~ a large number of tasks were waiting for my attention~ one of which was sorting out my health care program. Other demands on my time were (and are) supporting several charitable causes since I “retired”~ plus writing the trip report for our Asia expedition.   Despite those demands~ I managed to do a number of hikes in the local hills~ ranging from 6 miles to 15 miles in length~ with altitude gains of 1500 to 2300 feet of elevation gain (and loss on returning to the car). I also wore the TX4's for walking to the local grocery store~ pizza parlor~ and sandwich shop (about 4 miles for each). I also made treks to our closest well-known climbing areas at Pinnacles National Park and Castle Rock State Park (well-known for producing a number of well-known climbers).   The following photos show the positioning of the TX4's on various slopes to give an idea of the gripiness of the shoes. I was well pleased with the performance both on the volcanic conglomerate at Pinnacles NP and on the sandstone at Castle Rock SP.   Castle Rock is very close to being on the San Andreas. The rock there is coastal sandstone. This means that during dry spells~ some sections of rock are well cemented~ while others are very friable~ and brushing the surface with your hand or shoe scrapes off sand particles. Climbing at Castle Rock is forbidden during rain and for a minimum of 3 days after the rain stops. The climbing is mostly bouldering~ and in most of the park is very enjoyable. The following are on various formations in the park.   In a jam crack   Comfortable grip when down-climbing   Good grip when smearing on sandstone   Pinnacles National Park sits directly on the San Andreas Fault Rift. The rock is a volcanic conglomerate with pieces of a wide variety of minerals embedded in the solidified magma. Some of the minerals are in the form of large crystals that would provide large steps~ if the crystals were not highly polished slopers and did not from time to time simply lift out in your hand~ plus being located in widely spaced random patterns. In some places the climbing requires long reaches and/or big steps.   The video is on a formation named the Sisters~ in particular on First Sister. There were other climbers doing routes just around the rock a short distance~ and it is their voices you are hearing~ as well as some commentary between them and me. The routes are run-out in many places~ so I was providing them some hints on where the bolts were located.   The big inclusions in the Pinnacles volcanic conglomerate tend to be slick~ so step between them   Excellent grip on the gritty sections of the volcanic conglomerate   The “Climbing Zone” worked well on the slick inclusions   Descending while facing out provided comfortable grip   Note in the video that during the ascent~ you are seeing the bottom of my shoe most of the time. This shows that the “Climbing Zone” at the toe of the shoes~ as seen in one of the photos~ is providing the grip by smearing.      Conclusions: The La Sportiva TX4 approach shoe meet all my listed expectations for an approach shoe. So I gave the shoe a full 5-star rating. Although I did not reach my intended hundred miles of approach~ I did accumulate about 60 miles. Most of this was on dusty trails~ though some included rocky sections and a bit of scrambling.   I can not completely comment on the “break-in” part of requirement 4 (durability and long-term usability)~ since I did not do a full 100 miles. The sole appears to be wearing well for a sticky rubber. We did get a little rain~ during which I can say that my feet remained dry (as you would expect for a leather upper). The leather upper also keeps the dust out~ unlike mesh uppers.   Keep in mind that everyone’s feet differ. So while the TX4 fit me perfectly~ so it might not fit people with a wide foot as well. Most approach shoes have a low top. I find this preferable for me~ since many of my approaches and exits require placing the sole flat on the rock~ hence angling the ankles. Since I have climbed for many years on slabs and using crampons on inclined ice~ I am fine with this. However~ some people might prefer an approach shoe with a mid to high ankle for ankle support.   The TX4 climbed very well on the sandstone of Castle Rock and on the volcanic conglomerate of Pinnacles. While I did not get a chance to climb on quartzite or limestone during the review period~ we have a quartzite floor at two of the doors of our house~ so I was able to do a bit of foot-scuffing to check the grip on quartzite~ where it did well.
529,scarpa,zen-pro,5.0,   Excellent fit with minimal to no break in required. Comfortable and nice looking as well.    Pros   Cons   I've only had these shoes a couple weeks~ probably not more than 30 miles on them so far.    I got these shoes from Sierra Trading Post just a few days before leaving for a week in Big Bend National Park.   On initial inspection they seemed very well made~ with no dangling threads or seams that didn't appear finished.    After wearing them around the house for a couple days I decided that they were sufficiently broken in to take on the trip along with a pair of Salomon boots for actual backpacking. The shoes were comfortable for traveling~ and during our first couple days of desert camping and day hiking they were as comfortable and stable as anything I've worn.   I liked the fact that the shoes are a solid suede material as protection from thorns and cactus spines is a pretty big priority with me!  I never had a problem with the shoes being penetrated by the aggressive vegetation found here.     The third day we loaded up backpacks and headed in to the mountains for a couple nights at elevation. My intention was to change to a pair of Salomon Wings Sky GTX boots for better support while carrying about 40 lbs of water~ food and assorted gear. However~ apparently these Scarpas felt good enough I never thought about changing footwear until I was a long way from the truck.    As it turned out this was not an issue. We hiked a total for 20 miles in the mountains~ including an initial 8 miles with 2~500 foot elevation gain to our first camp~ and I never~ not once~ wished that I had worn the boots.     Even on the descent~ I didn't have an issue with toes sliding forward and banging in to the front of my shoes.   Traction was fine throughout the trip. I never felt my feet sliding or out of control in any way.     After coming back down it was a simple matter to brush the shoes off and wear them into town for dinner.     Of course~ this is hardly a long-term test and how they'll stand up over many more trips remains to be seen. 
530,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.0,"   The Five Ten Guide Tennie is an approach shoe best suited to light hiking that involves scrambling on rocks. It has features common to many shoes that try to bridge the gap between hiking and rock climbing—lacing that runs almost to your toes to ensure a secure fit~ durable leather material~ and great lateral support. The midsole and sole are clearly intended for light rock climbing: stiff midsole~ extremely sticky sole with shallow treads~ and a rubber-coated toe for extra traction.       While it lacks the sole~ cushioning~ and support to be an all-day~ everyday low hiking shoe~ I’m happy walking for several hours in these~ and their performance on steep sections of rock is excellent.     Pros   Cons   INTRODUCTION   The Guide Tennie is made to get you to rocky trails~ then enjoy the rocks without slipping and sliding. I wear a size 12~ and the pair weighs a tad less than two pounds—so not by any means the lightest weight shoe you can find. One could reasonably fault some of Five Ten’s colorblind style choices~ but I am OK with this purple pair.   The upper of the shoe is a pretty robust~ rough-textured nubuck leather. In keeping with making this shoe well-suited for light rock climbing~ the midsole is reasonably firm~ the soles are both very sticky and sporting a well-defined edge. The tongue is reasonably well-cushioned and partially synthetic. I liked these shoes better after a couple of shakedown hikes~ so leave a little time to break them in.   The lacing eyes (no speed laces) run almost all the way to the toe; laces are flat nylon that stay tied~ which is nice. The sole has a light tread pattern~ big oval ‘dots~’ and the toe is covered with rubber.        FIT   I consider this to offer a middle of the road fit. My feet are slightly wide at the front~ average at the heel~ and I don’t have much of an arch. So~ I wear custom orthotics with every shoe I have that is not a sandal. This shoe has enough room to accommodate the ¾ length orthotic and a medium weight pair of socks with my wide-ish feet.    This is a fairly close-fitting shoe if you haul the laces tight~ which is what you want if you are navigating rocky slabs. I use a light/medium merino Darn Tough or Point 6 ankle high sock with them~ which has worked well for me.   My feet are a little wide in the front~ and these have enough room to wear comfortably all day. There is no insole of any substance. I have worn them all day for many days~ and they feel good. The lacing on these and other approach shoes does a great job ensuring that your foot stays anchored and doesn’t slide around~ no matter how steep the terrain.    Approach shoes like the Guide Tennie all~ to some degree~ have a less-forgiving midsole in terms of flex. That is because the stiffness makes for better rock climbing performance. If you plan to walk a number of miles in these~ getting used to that stiffness helps somewhat. I liked these shoes better after they had a couple of five mile hikes under their belt.    As you can see~ there is some EVA foam in the heel area~ and a loop at the back to clip them to a pack with a carabiner.   SUPPORT   Medium. The shoe is fine for day hiking and fantastic for steep sections~ and the heel areas have some limited cushioning for hiking in between the steep parts. This is not the best shoe if you are carrying a medium to heavy backpack or walking all day~ day after day. I would want more cushioning~ deeper treads that work better with mud and other messy trail conditions~ and a more forgiving midsole for constant walking and hiking. If you compare this to a typical low hiking shoe~ you will probably think the sole/midsole feels kind of stiff~ like all approach shoes I have ever tried on. In terms of your foot shifting side to side or front to back~ these are outstanding.   On the positive side~ this shoe is made to take a beating and will protect your feet from pointy rocks~ and your toes from getting whacked by lurking obstacles.  The rough-out leather material is tough and shows virtually no wear after a healthy number of miles.   WATERPROOFNESS/BREATHABILITY   This is not a waterproof shoe—no membrane. You could treat the leather with a water repellant spray~ and they might then be water resistant~ but this isn’t the best rainy day shoe. Because I use these for fooling around on rocks~ I don’t take them when I anticipate rainy conditions~ and some of the slabbed trails in our area are pretty sketchy and dangerous when they are wet~ no matter what kind of shoe you wear.    All leather shoes also have limited ability to vent moisture. On the hottest days I have worn the Guide Tennie~ I find quite a bit of moisture breathes straight out through the tongue~ which is mesh/synthetic. I didn’t expect that~ but it’s helpful. With a good pair of merino socks and that tongue~ I never felt my feet were getting unduly damp or uncomfortable. Considering the hot and humid conditions I see most of the summer~ that’s pretty good.     It is worth mentioning that I have had Goretex membranes in other shoes fail within a year of purchase; this is my second pair of Oboz waterproof hikers~ and I have not experienced any failure.    TRACTION   Five Ten's ""stealth"" rubber soles are one of the company's main selling points. It is very grippy on rocks~ the same material used in most of Five Ten's dedicated rock climbing shoes. (Note~ Adidas acquired Five Ten at some point). All climbing and approach shoes like to promote how sticky and grippy their soles are; most such claims have some merit~ as the gummy rubber used in these is fairly different from a typical hiking or trail running shoe. And~ these soles are as grippy as you will find.    Nice flat area in the front for smearing~ and great beveled sole for edging. This is the Guide Tennie’s wheelhouse—smearing the toe area~ edging on steep sections of rock~ benefitting from a lightly-treaded and extremely sticky rubber sole. It’s rock-climbing sole rubber on a multi-purpose shoe. These shoes shine on rock scrambles and slabs under most weather conditions~ and I feel very sure-footed on tricky~ low-traction surfaces with these shoes.       The light treads aren’t great in mud and don’t give you great traction in loose soil or riverside trails covered with little pebbles and rocks. Most approach shoes present some kind of compromise on this issue.        Expect a sole this sticky to wear relatively quickly if you use them on rocks a lot. It’s too soon for me to say how quickly they wear~ but a few spots are showing some wear after about three months.   DURABILITY   The leather uppers are very durable for a low shoe~ and the toe cap is robust. Everything seems very well stitched and glued together~ and nothing has come loose. It's hard to estimate a shoe's durability after three months~ but it appears made to last and to take a fair bit of abuse. See my comments about about the soles—constant use on rocks probably means a re-sole before you wear out the uppers.    TESTING CONDITIONS   Over the past few months~ I have worn these for somewhere between 50 and 75 miles. Lots of hiking on local trails this summer~ rock-hopping along a local stream and the edge of the Potomac River with the dog. The riverside trails nearby have a combination of rough and steep granite and water-smoothed~ undulating sections that present some real traction challenges~ which is the reason I started looking at approach shoes a number of years ago.   A typical hike will be 5-7 miles~ about half on the rocks and half on sand/dirt/semi-rocky paths. I like these for the hike in; the flat and relatively stiff sole/midsole means I really haven't come close to twisting an ankle~ and there is enough padding that my feet aren't getting battered. I love the traction on the steep and rocky sections.    I haven’t carried a backpack heavier than about 20 pounds with them.       SUMMARY   Before you buy~ ask yourself what you want out of the shoe~ especially if you are thinking about an approach shoe. Approach shoes as a category are a hybrid between low hikers and dedicated rock climbing shoes~ basically. If your trails are rocky~ if you see a lot of slabs~ steep rocky sections~ smooth rocks that might make you think your regular hiking shoes/boots are going to slip~ you might enjoy the superior tracking and rock scramble capability of these. They offer traction you really can’t get with low hikers~ trail runners~ or hiking boots.   I have worn two other brands of approach shoes over the years and have liked them all for various reasons. These perform best on the climbing and slabbing parts of your day—awesome traction~ very good feel for the rocks. They are fine for the walking and hiking part of the equation too~ but there are other options that might be more comfortable if you’re primarily hiking instead of climbing.   I give them a solid “four” rating overall; for the climbing aspect~ they are excellent.  "
531,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.5,   I purchased these shoes for fishing. The comfort and fit were outstanding. They have great traction on all the rock and soil types I have thrown at them. Imagine the comfort of a slipper with the grip of a climbing shoe. After a few trips I ordered a second pair.   Pros   Cons   After burning through several pairs of high end hiking shoes~ I decided to purchase the Guide Tennie. I figured any shoe produced for 30 plus years has to have something going for it. I found them on Amazon for about half the MSRP.   Right out of the box the shoe was really comfortable. We are talking big untied skate shoe comfort. The first real test was hopping along some boulders and loose rock along the river. I was surprised at just how well they handled the mixed terrain of a loose trail and wet rock.   After about four trips to different areas I was sold. I ordered a second pair in a separate color. These have become my go-to shoe for most occasions. While some of the colors are a bit gaudy~ those seem to be on sale the cheapest. So order away and leave your personal stylists at home.   .
532,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.0,   Got these in the Yosemite mountain shop and walked around the valley for two days taking pictures. A little scrambling to get in position for some shots of climbers on El Cap and walking the roads of the valley to get around. The salesman talked me into getting my regular size because I wasn't planning on doing any technical climbing and I'm glad he did.       I strolled around and put probably ten miles on them in two days. It was a warm November 1st and 2nd (70 degrees daytime) and with summer weight wool socks my feet had absolutely no problems.   Pros   Cons   I grew up in Missouri and when I moved out west realized that I needed different gear to go with the new terrain I encountered. Hiking in the Sierras~ San Gabriel Mtns~ and Joshua Tree was rocky and steep. I wanted shoes that were sticky and stable. These shoes were it for day hikes and approaches. The midsole was stiff enough to carry a decent load for afternoons (10-20 pounds).    After owning them for a month or so I had to cut about an inch of sole off the heel of both shoes because they had come unglued and were flopping around. Also the side stitching on both shoes had started to unravel. This doesn't effect anything about the way the shoe performs~ it's just cosmetic. I did replace the insoles to something thicker and softer.   The only other problem I had I found out about while doing a day hike in JTNP. While hiking on trail to some petroglyphs the soles were picking up little bb sized stones that made the soles very slick. This is also a constant problem on dirt trails. I learned very quickly to do a little stutter step where rain the sole of the shoe down the inside of my leg from knee to ankle.    I've had these shoes for 6 years now and wear them in the woods and around town. They are really comfy and assuredly have a look. They do need to be resoled~ but now that I live back in the Midwest it's not vital that I do so.    I definitely recommed these to anyone in need of an approach shoe or hiking shoe for rocky environments.
533,five-ten,guide-tennie,0.5,"   These are the worst shoes I have ever worn. They feel like blocks of wood duct taped to the bottom of my feet. My feet hurt so bad after. I have bought Five Ten shoes in the past and been happy. These caused blisters and a week of foot pain for two hours of use. A lot of money to spend on shoes I have to probably modify with arch supports.     Pros   Cons   I took them to a rocky trail system to break them in. Wore them for two hours. Six miles of rocky assents and descents later I was limping my way back to the truck.   Called Eastern Mountain Sports for an exchange~ not a return. They do not exchange ""used"" shoes. Should've stuck with REI.     Have been wearing bandaids on my feet all week because of these medieval torture devices. Never again will I test a shoe mail order."
534,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.0,   A good quality sticky approach shoe that allows you to climbs rocks well. This review is for the current 2015 model Guide Tennie Approach Shoe by Five Ten.    Pros   Cons   A good quality sticky approach shoe that allows you to climbs rocks well. This review is for the current 2015 model Guide Tennie Approach Shoe by Five Ten.   This model seems to be a little narrower and longer than earlier models. The toe box is very roomy~ which concerned me on how well they would edge on small rock features. But after a good amount of scrambling and actual rock climbing~ my concerns were unfounded. The shoes allow you to climb very technical routes due to the stiff mid sole and sticky rubber.   The rubber soles are very sticky~ so sticky that gravel sticks to them and falls onto your other shoe while walking. I have had to clean out pebbles from my shoes multiple times a day while hiking.   These climb better than my previous favorite approach shoes (Camp 4s) because they are stiffer and have a better toe geometry. The Camp 4s are slightly more comfortable for hiking since they fit more like a regular tennis shoe. But if you want an approach shoe that will allow you to climb easy routes~ these will work well.   The only negative I see is that the shoelaces that come with the shoes are too slippery and thin to hold a knot well. Even double knotted they will work loose over time. Hey~ I'm a rock climber~ I know how to tie a knot.   The Guide Tennie approach shoe is a solid shoe that has a great balance of stiffness and comfort for rock scrambling/hiking.
535,five-ten,guide-tennie,5.0,   I have never had a shoe like this. I was surprised when I got them~ not only do they look good and feel good~ I feel like a mountain goat when I go rock hopping.   Pros   I grabbed these because I like to rock hop and run the rocks where I am. So I grabbed a pair of these because I had seen them a lot before I bought them. I didn't expect to like them or to find them comfortable.   I was wrong. I love them! Nice and grippy~ very well made. I wouldn't expect the tread to last long for daily wear on hard surfaces as they seem to be made of a soft compound.
536,five-ten,guide-tennie,5.0,   Best shoes for canyon hikers and canyoneering!   Pros   Cons   On my fourth pair~ I never consider going into a canyon without them. I do admit they have poor arch support out of the box~ but this can be fixed with inserts of your choice. I prefer Superfeet.   I've used them for scrambling~ bouldering~ canyoneering~ lightweight hiking into an approach~ although I suggest no pack loads over 15 lbs. I also recommend wearing lightweight socks~ or even none~ when canyon hiking as your feet tend to swell.   There are two drawbacks to the shoe.   I honestly don't care about heating issues or ankle support—these shoes are great for me. I use them because the type of hiking I do can be dangerous and when I have these on~ I feel safe and secure~ even when the shoe is wet.
537,five-ten,guide-tennie,1.0,   I must admit~ I fell for the sales pitch on these shoes. It sounded nice - technical. The shoes looked attractive too...but after a few hikes~ two in fact~ they don't look so good now. These are some things you need to know:   If this shoe gets wet~ the sole begins to fall of...after spending $95 on these shoes I am sick of having to glue them back together. I wanted these shoes to last a reasonable time - not less than a week.   The rubber is sooo sticky~ every thing sticks to it. You end up sliding every where.   Even if you don't have wads of muck caked to this shoe~ the rubber does not grip at all well on wet stone surfaces.   The leather is of such a poor quality that it begins to tear around the rubber toe cap....I think it would have been stronger if they used paper.   I just don't get it...why market a shoe for a particular terrain but give it such a piss poor manufacture. The shoe comes is made in China and the sole is stuck on in America I think. as far as I am concerned both suck~ shoe included!!
538,five-ten,guide-tennie,5.0,   This is a lightweight~ comfortable~ well made approach shoe that climbs extremely well. While great for approaches and descents~ it also serves as a light hiker.   Pros   Cons   I use this shoe as it was designed to be used: as an approach shoe for technical rock climbing. I've used it in sport~ trad~ and wilderness climbing areas with great success. As an example~ I climbed the East Buttress of Middle Cathedral in Yosemite and they worked great~ but by the end of the walk off my feet felt a bit pounded.
539,five-ten,guide-tennie,5.0,   When I first purchased this shoe I thought it might be a bit stiff in the sole~ but it has loosened up beautifully: not too soft/sloppy~ not too stiff. I also had some doubts about its performance on loose slopes and leaf cover~ but they have performed admirably off-trail.     I recently did two days in the Organ Mountains in NM~ and was quite impressed. They not only perform~ but are comfortable.     I do have some questions about the durability of the uppers — I noticed a small nick/peeling of them yesterday.  That said I have taken them through some extremely abrasive rocky slopes.   All-in-all a fantastic performing/fitting shoe for me.
540,five-ten,guide-tennie,3.5,   Son zapatillas extraordinarias en muchos sentidos pero.... muchos peros...   - Se rompen todos siempre por los laterales al mínimo roce... y quedan feos e inservibles.   Deberían tener refuerzos de goma en los laterales y serían más duraderos e impermeables.   - Se despega la goma de la punta y del talón con facilidad   - Deberían ser un poquito más rígidos en la punta-   - La goma de la punta debería ser de mayor grosor porque se desgasta rápidamente.   - No se pueden pisar los charcos. Te mojas los pies. Esto con la goma se solucionaría.   - Son caras de cojones
541,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.5,   Great shoe. A little too nice for rugged climbing but its nice to have them on in case you feel the need to climb and you're not carrying your regular climbing shoes.     Great fit and finish although I must say that the Stealth soles are the same as Five Ten's regular climbing shoes - they leave marks so if you happen to wear them for casual wear - you need to remind yourself so you won't mark up the tile or wood flooring.  A+.
542,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.5,   Overall I was very impressed with these shoes. I wear them as daily shoes as well as for outdoor adventures. They have taken me to Granite Peak in Montana twice. I hiked with them in the ten or so miles with a forty pound pack and ascended the peak with them. They performed great.   The only issue I've had is the sole coming apart~ but it's nothing a little super glue can't fix. Xool styling plus high usability make these shoes winners in my book.
543,five-ten,guide-tennie,4.5,   This is a great shoe. I'm on my fourth pair and I use them hard: work~ climb~ hike~ play. Very comfortable~ great fit~ super sticky rubber. Sole does tend to peal off at the toe but this is easily and permanently solved by pealing it back a little further and resticking with super glue.
544,la-sportiva,boulder-x,3.5,"   I really wanted to like these shoes~ but had to return two pairs due to the inner-lining splitting/ripping. Maybe just bad luck?    Pros   Cons   I really wanted to like these shoes~ in fact when new I utterly loved them~ for the first 50 miles.   They simply started to wear too fast — not the sole~ but the inner lining. My first pair the lining split open at the heal~ and the second pair it started to go in the same place before I quickly gave up and returned them. Currently looking for a replacement~ most likely the Scarpa Ascent.   The rubber~ combined with the almost ""climbing shoe fit"" and the lacing right down to the toes is just awesome. No issues with even ""heavy"" edging~ i.e.~ with a pack on.   The lacing is maybe a long term weak point? That is just an observation~ as I quickly returned mine with the faulty/split lining~ but the lacing seems that it may pull out of the leather after long use.   The sole tread pattern is great~ loads of grip although most suited to drier conditions. In the wet I'd put them in the ""ok-good"" category.   I found the shoes pretty warm/hot on the feet and not able to breathe very well. They also let the water soak through~ even in wet grass.   Like first said~ I tried hard to like these shoes; they do tick all the right boxes~ just a few niggles to consider. I gave them 3.5 stars just as that rubber and sole is so great in the dry~ and the fit."
545,la-sportiva,boulder-x,4.0,   More comfortable than the majority of other approach shoes and holds up to some strenuous wear.   Pros   Cons   Let me start I by saying that even the thought of purchasing shoes online having not tried them on terrifies me.  Perhaps you know the feeling too. How many experiences have you had where you see a pair of shoes online~ spring for them and anxiously await their arrival only to receive them and find out that the styling isn’t what you thought~ the sizing is off~ and the shape of the shoes doesn’t match your feet?   I’ve had too many to recount~ so I generally stay away from making such purchases. I do~ however~ conduct most of my window shopping online prior to making purchases. Each time I have~ I’ve found that my first pick is generally not the best fit~ which only adds to my aversion from online shoe purchases.    Thankfully~ when it came time to purchase a new pair of approach shoes~ I had the luxury of trying on multiple pair in-store to get a final read on what would be best for my needs. On my store visit~ I tried on the Boulder X along with several other La Sportiva and Salewa models. I was pleased because not only did I like the general styling of the Boulder X~ but they were significantly cheaper than several of the others I had considered.    The shoes have held up. I have been on strenuous hikes and a few canyoneering expeditions and have experienced positive results. The shoes have overall good support and reinforcement in all the necessary places — toes~ sides and heel.   I initially noticed a subtle hot-spot on the back of my heel~ but that was fixed when I adjusted the tightness of the continuous lacing system. I have since also adjusted the tongue from being laced under the side flanks to being laced on top of the side flanks. I have found that this helps prevent from debris entering the shoe and also relieves some of the pressure caused by the laces.    One thing that I would note is that the shoe does not have much breathability. There is not ventilation in the shoe and as such~ it can be quite warm. I have used these shoes in desert environments and they can get pretty hot.  Also~ due to the lack of ventilation~ the shoes take a while to completely dry out when they get wet~ which can be quite annoying if you’re trekking through damp areas.    Overall~ I’d say that these shoes are well worth their price point. They handle varied terrain well and are comfortable for short and even longer hikes/treks. 
546,la-sportiva,boulder-x,4.5,   Excellent shoe! I used them on the outdoor for 20 miles and didn't feel anything in my feet. I recommend it a lot.   Pros   The fit is OK. They're really comfort and the support it's OK. Don't try them in the rain.   For me these are wonderful shoes.
547,scarpa,crux,4.0,   Very comfortable. Great for approach.   Pros   Cons   I really like this shoe. I usually wear an 8 and settled on a 39 which I think is a little bigger than a 7.5. I wear these shoes everywhere.   I have a collapsed left arch and prominent navicular bones. This means my navicular often hangs over the edge of the sole of most shoes and it can get quite uncomfortable if there is any sort of arch in the shoe. These have no arch support and so work great for me.   The toe box is roomy enough for my otherwise average width forefoot. The heel cup might be one of the best things on this shoe though. It's almost like having a climbing shoe on when you go uphill~ there is no slippage and it even feels like actually cups around your heel to hold it there.   No break-in time needed. Just slip them on and go. I did take them up to the Wind Rivers too very shortly after I got them for a backpacking trip. I could have wished for something with a little more support for my ankles~ but that is just me. I know many people carry pretty heavy loads without big boots. I have funky feet though and rarely go backpacking and with climbing gear to boot. So I'm not used to that heavy of a load for that many miles.   My main concern with the shoe is that the sole will not last as long as I'd like it to. Because my feet are so hard to fit I hate shoe shopping and hope for my shoes to last several years. The sole on this shoe between the rubber outsole and shoe bed is a firmish foam like material. I can already see some compression of it. I wonder if I'll be able to make it make than a year. Also because the actually shoe sole is a softer rubber for extra stickiness I don't see it lasting for several years either.
548,scarpa,crux,3.5,   Low profile~ comfortable shoe that works awesome for hikes in to the local crag and to climb in.    Pros   Cons   I have worn the Scarpa Crux approach shoes on a climbing trip through Wyoming as well as a spring's worth of trips to my local crags in Arkansas. So far~ I have been very impressed with the shoe.   Quick break-in time~ low profile shoe that is nice so that I am less likely to roll my ankles. I get a great sense of feel of the ground beneath my feet and climbing in the shoes is awesome. I climbed as well in the Crux as some of my mates did in their actual climbing shoes.   I would highly recommend this shoe~ although I have noticed the rubber to separate from the shoe. Right now it is minimal~ but I do have a slight cause for concern that it could get worse. Still TBD on that part. 
549,scarpa,crux,5.0,   Great overall approach shoe. They do the job. Good for scrambling up rock~ hiking and around town. I would highly recommend these shoes.   Pros   Cons   I got back into climbing again after 15 years and was looking for a comfortable approach shoe. I was running marathons and so I'm always looking for light and roomy. My feet are pretty beat up over time.   I love these shoes. They are light~ comfortable~ easy to scramble up rock~ or just hiking and they look great for around town. They fit true to size and have enough cushion not to feel the ground while carrying a pack.
550,la-sportiva,tx3,4.5,"   The La Sportiva TX3 is an approach shoe~ which means that it is intended for both hiking and scrambling or light rock climbing. Like many of the best approach shoes~ it has sole made from rubber that is very sticky and grippy on rocks~ has the kind of close fit that rock climbers like~ and a longer run of laces than a typical hiking shoe that helps them fit almost ""like a glove.""       At the same time~ their mesh uppers~ cushioned midsole~ and healthy tread depth make them better than most approach shoes for hiking. If these shoes have any downside~ the mesh could wear faster than leather from getting scraped on rocks—but you will see that hasn’t been an issue for me. (Anything that spends a lot of time getting scraped by rocks tends to wear out faster~ and mesh isn't generally as durable as leather.)   Pros   Cons   One of the best all-around approach shoes I have worn. Highly recommended.   INTRODUCTION      The La Sportiva TX3~ like all other shoes in this category~ is a dual purpose shoe for both hiking and light rock climbing. As some of my photos show~ I live near the Potomac River~ in Maryland~ and a lot of the hiking I do alternates between trails and river-smoothed rocks~ scrambles~ and slabs. The larger mountains in the Shenandoahs in nearby Virginia have a number of extended scrambles and exposed slabs.   Can you tackle the kinds of trails I often see in trail runners or light hikers? Absolutely~ and both trail runners and light hikers tend to be more comfortable on trails than approach shoes. However~ neither trail runners nor light hikers perform as well for light rock climbing. That's why I have~ for several years~ favored approach shoes for many of my local hikes that have meaningful sections that are more like easy rock climbing or scrambling.   This is the first pair of La Sportiva approach shoes I have worn~ but it probably won't be the last. I have also used approach shoes from Five Ten~ Treksta~ and Oboz.   As I'll discuss in more detail below~ approach shoes share some features that make them a better choice for light rock climbing: very sticky/grippy rubber soles~ including a rubber toe cap and a flat front area for smearing; defined edges on the sole for edging; relatively thin midsoles to give you a good feel for the ground under your feet; and lacing that runs closer to the toe so you can really lock down the fit and avoid having your feet slide around. These are all features they share with dedicated rock climbing shoes~ but no sane person would hike in a rock climbing shoe because they offer zero support and virtually no traction on normal trails—great for climbing~ terrible for walking.   My size 12 pair fit well with a light hiking sock or thick running sock (more on that below). They run true to size.  (La Sportiva also makes the TX3 for women~ with a last specifically for women.) The goal of an approach shoe is to wear one shoe that gets you to rocky trails~ then enjoy the rocks without slipping and sliding. My pair weighs 26 ounces (one pound ten ounces). That’s somewhat lighter-weight than other approach shoes I have worn~ they tend to run at least two pounds per pair~ and it is probably because these shoes have a mesh upper~ whereas some approach shoes have an all-leather upper to help combat friction damage while rock climbing/scrambling.       The TX3’s upper is very breathable nylon mesh—super-hot orange on these~ an extremely bright color. The sole of these shoes is made of sticky rubber~ typical of this subspecies of shoe. The midsole of this shoe is closer to a low hiker than many approach shoes~ and the combination of mesh and a softer midsole makes these particularly comfortable for long stints of walking and hiking. In this sense~ they feel a bit like a pair of running shoes~ though their soles are more firm and they have a much more locked-in fit.       It’s worth noting that I wore these with custom orthotics—I do that with every shoe I wear. However~ in situations where I transitioned to climbing or scrambling~ I stopped and swapped the orthotics out and put the stock insole in. I felt the stock insole~ which runs the full length of the shoe~ helped the shoes fit better near the ball of my foot for rock scrambling. On the other hand~ I felt these shoes lacked some support for my flat feet while hiking unless I put in the orthotics.    As you can see~ the laces run fairly far down toward the toes~ which is common on rock climbing and approach shoes to help ensure a tight~ secure fit. The lacing system is interesting—speed laces toward the toe~ and eyes combined with speed laces closer to the ankle. These are really easy to tighten. The soles have a well-defined edge~ another feature of shoes made to ascend rocks using small protrusions~ and a wide~ flat area near the toes that helps provide extra friction.       These shoes needed virtually no break-in time.     The toes are covered with rubber—better to avoid dinging your toes and providing a little extra friction if you insert your toe into a crack while climbing. Also~ they have loops behind each heel so you can clip them to a pack or climbing harness with a carabiner.      FIT   My feet have a normal heel and a wide forefoot. I wear wide sizes in some dress and hiking shoes~ whereas shoes that run wider in the forefoot work well for me without width sizing. The TX3 has a wider forefoot. As I noted above~ I wore these with 3/4 length orthotics for walking. For climbing~ where you benefit from a tighter~ closer fit~ I swapped in the stock inserts for longer climbs or scrambles to add a little volume in the forefoot area.   Also~ these have speed laces toward the toe. I thought the TX3 lacing system made them easy to get a good fit~ no feet sliding around~ with a number of different light-hiking socks~ like Darn Tough's Hiker 1/4 Sock~ Balega's Blister Resist Quarter sock~ and FITS Light Hiker Quarter. The mesh upper is forgiving. I never blistered in these shoes.        While many approach shoes tend to have stiff midsoles that make them better for climbing~ the TX3 has a midsole that gets closer to some low-hiking shoes in terms of cushioning. That makes them more comfortable for hiking. Some climbers might prefer an approach shoe with a stiffer midsole and leather uppers that absorb abuse better while rock-climbing.   SUPPORT   These should be fine for people with a normal arch. If you are a larger person or tend to overpronate~ think about using your orthotics or swapping the stock insoles for something with more support~ like Superfeet or a custom orthotic.       Better than average support~ cushioning~ and treads for hiking if you want an approach shoe that shines as more of a trail runner or very light~ low hiking shoe.    For rock scrambling and light climbing~ these feel slightly less secure than stiffer~ all-leather approach shoes. Nonetheless~ I was surprised at the level of lateral support these had for such a light~ breathable shoe.   WATERPROOFNESS/BREATHABILITY   These are fabulous in warmer weather—breathability is outstanding. They are designed to breathe~ and I'm sure that is why La Sportiva makes these with a nylon mesh upper. If your feet sweat~ moisture gets out of the TX3~ so long as you're wearing a good pair of socks that wick moisture away from your feet. Many approach shoes are made from leather to protect them from getting damaged on rocks~ and that means they tend to not breathe very well. These shoes are not going to make your feet feel damp or soggy due to lack of ventilation—quite the opposite.    That said~ whether they have synthetic or leather uppers~ approach shoes as a class aren’t waterproof. Rain makes rock and friction climbing highly treacherous. Leather approach shoes will get wet~ soggy~ and heavy when it rains; the TX3's very breathable mesh lets water right in. If you step in a deep puddle~ wear them on a rainy day~ or end up on muddy trails with the TX3~ your feet are going to get wet.   I didn’t treat these shoes with any kind of water-repellant~ but I don’t think it would make much difference. I use approach shoes on hikes when I expect to be scrambling and climbing up smooth rock slabs~ which is pretty common near where we live~ both on the trails by the Potomac River (rock smoothed by centuries of water flow) or the rocky trails and slabs in the Shenandoah in Virginia—neither of which are fun in the rain or when they’re wet. The stickiest rubber in the world won’t help much in wet conditions.   If you anticipate using these on wet or muddy trails to get you to your rock climb or scramble~ bring an extra pair of socks.        TRACTION      La Sportiva uses Vibram Megagrip rubber for the soles of all its approach shoes. It’s a softer rubber compound that is very ""sticky"" on rocks~ well-suited for climbing. These are quite grippy—among the better options I have tried~ though most approach shoes are pretty good at traction on rocks.   The flat sole under the toes made these great for smearing my way up slabs on one of my favorite local trails. At the same time~ the big~ flat lugs and treads on the TX3 provide outstanding traction on rocks~ gravel~ even in mud. Check out the photo in the section above—that was a particularly muddy day~ where I alternated between deep puddles and sloppy mud for a couple of hours. That’s fairly unusual for an approach shoe—many shoes in this category sacrifice trail traction for more surface area and grip on smoother rocks.       The rubbery toe cap and nice edges on the outside of these shoes also help provide better traction for climbing.   So~ what sets these approach shoes apart from many competitors is the deeper lugs across the entire sole. These perform almost as well in mud and on dirty~ gravelly trails as light hiking shoes as far as traction is concerned.       The inevitable trade-off with softer~ grippy soles is wear. These have done well considering the amount of walking I did in them~ but they’ll wear faster than harder~ more wear-resistant soles you find on most trail runners and light hikers.     DURABILITY   I initially had concerns the mesh uppers would wear through; that hasn’t happened. If someone uses these relentlessly on rocks~ it’s still a point to think about as compared to leather approach shoes. Still~ give La Sportiva credit; these are well-made and have proved to be very durable so far. I had the same thoughts about the speed laces and heel loops. They look kind of thin and prone to wear. Still~ despite a lot of hiking and scrambling in these over three months~ none of that tore or was compromised in any way.     TESTING CONDITIONS   I have used the TX3s for the past three to four months. Local trails I normally use are by the Potomac River and are a mix of sand~ gravel~ and rough and smooth rocks. A pretty good testing ground. I also brought them on a trip to the Middle East and used them for walking around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv~ in parks~ in the desert~ on a half-day archeological dig~ and in an oasis that alternated between water-smoothed and jagged rocks. On more than one occasion~ our wet Mid-Atlantic winter meant I used these on some fairly wet~ muddy trails as well. While I have not kept track of the mileage~ I easily exceeded fifty miles in the TX3s.       The most weight I carried in these was around 30 pounds. That’s about as much weight as I will carry in a pair of low shoes with no ankle support. The soles and midsoles are thick enough to protect feet from most normal obstacles. I would choose a shoe with more ankle support and at least a partial shank for the most jagged hiking trails or for carrying any reasonably large backpack.    SUMMARY   Approach shoes serve a fairly specific purpose—they combine the ability to get to a steep climb and great traction for light rock climbing and equivalent types of activity. This genre of shoe (not just the TX3—any approach shoe) lacks the cushioning of most trail runners and the support of most trail runners or light hikers. The TX3 is great for climbing~ slabbing~ and scrambling~ and they are very comfortable for light hiking too.   I have worn three other brands of approach shoes over the years and have liked them all for various reasons. These have some crossover qualities you will find in a trail runner/low hiker that make them a better choice for the hiking aspect of their mission than most of their competitors—a little more cushioning~ lighter weight~ a more forgiving and breathable nylon mesh upper. They’re as versatile and useful in multiple situations~ as any other approach shoe I have tried.     I gave them 4 ½ stars because they do so well at both hiking and climbing overall; for the climbing aspect~ they are excellent.     Experience   3-4 months of trail hiking and scrambling in the mid-Atlantic and a two-week trip in the Middle East (combination of city walking and hiking)."
551,five-ten,guide-tennie-mid,4.5,   Very good shoe — great for use on climbing approaches~ just replace the laces before using them.   Pros   Cons   Love this shoe~ very sticky sole.   Not sure if I love the ankle height yet~ feels a bit like it's cutting into my legs but probably just needs to be broken in.   My one main complaint so far is that the laces are terrible — so slippery~ hard to tighten. I will just replace the laces though~ easy fix.   I also was not able to find these shoes anywhere in AZ (Tucson~ Phoenix~ Flagstaff) to try them on before buying~ so I had to guess. My guess was far off but I talked to a Five Ten rep and she was very helpful~ I was able to exchange them for the right size. It's always a bit tricky to figure out the size for these climbing shoe brands~ doesn't exactly translate from street shoe size.   Sizes:My street shoe size is Womens 7.5Originally bought Mens 6.5Exchanged for Mens 5.5~ fits wellMy climbing shoes in this brand (Five Ten Rogue VCS Women's) are a size Women's 8.5~ UK 6.0~ EUR 39.5~ CM250  for reference.   Would definitely recommend as an approach shoe or hiking shoe if you like to scramble and rock hop a lot.Recently used them in Red Rocks (NV) and it felt like cheating to walk down slabs of sandstone. Very comfy and sticky~ would buy again for sure!   
552,scarpa,zodiac-tech-gtx,4.5,"   The Scarpa Zodiac Tech is a near perfect light mountain boot. Great sticky Vibram sole and a perfect fit makes for all day comfort. I’d love to see a toe welt added and the colour possibly tweaked a little. This boot would be best for glacial travel~ light scrambling~ non-technical peaks as well as winter hiking (both with traction devices or snowshoes).   Pros   Cons      Opening Rant   I’m not sure what category these boots fit in. And I don’t say that as a negative~ as you can see from the star rating and (if reading further) an otherwise glowing review. I just don’t know what they do best~ probably because they do at lot of things really~ really well. They are clearly taking aim at the La Sportiva Trango’s strangle hold of the “somewhere in between the approach and the mountaineering boot” market~ but that is a very small niche.    You could easily get away with using them exclusively for three-season mountaineering~ and even some mild winter peaks~ but anything around -15°C or colder you are going to want more insulation~ as well as the ability to dry out a double boot.   With that said~ they are just so comfortable and so well designed that I have found I’ve been reaching for them all winter.      Fit/Comfort   Normally I find marketing lingo to be mostly hype and pay it no mind. Scarpa promotes these as made with “sock fit construction~” but they literally fit my foot as comfortably as a sock. I don’t really know how to describe my feet~ but let's start with ugly.    I have a narrow heel and a forefoot~ low arches and wider forefeet. I’ve never had any problems with heel slippage and the toe boxes roomy enough to not cause any restriction (especially important in winter boots as people often complain of cold feet due to a lack of circulation).    I usually wear a 10.5 U.S. shoe and received a size 10.5 for testing~ which fits perfectly with a pair of light merino socks. It weighs 1lb 8 oz per boots~ which is extremely lightweight and compares favourably with the 1 lb 10 oz Trango which is wildly popular~ as does the price $290 for the Scarpa and $320 for the La Sportiva.      I did what I would do with any new pair of boots to give these a fair shot—wear them around the house exclusively for a week or two. A couple hours a night will quickly alert you to any potential problem areas/hot spots/etc. Once they passed that test (with flying colours) I generally move to a couple shorter day hikes (~5 kms). I was so confident in these however that they were thrown into a couple 12-km approaches with mixed terrain right away.   I’m not sure really where to start with the number of features they’ve added to make this such a comfortable fit.   The sole of the boot is a Vibram Pentax Precision II XT that has a great combination of support and rigidity while still allowing good ground feel and the flex required for all day comfort.       On Scarpa’s website they are given a B1 rating~ not sure why as in my opinion they are firmly in the B2 category [able to be used for light winter~ good ankle support and able to use with either a new-matic~ or strap-on (C1 or C2)~ crampon]. I don’t own either (again this is another niche I find too small as I either use a full rigid for mountaineering and ice climbing~ or a fully flexible “crampon” like the Hillsound Trail Crampon~ (which I consider more of a light traction device rather than a full on crampon~ for trail use) but that's a rant for another day.   I did rent a pair from my local MEC to test the fit~ and found the Petzl Vasak that I borrowed to fit securely. These boots will not work with a step-in style crampon as there is no toe welt. This is probably my only major disappointment with this boot. It would be so easy to add~ and provides the securest binding for a crampon. The sole has a slight rocker shape to it which aids you in hiking on flatter trails.      The “Autofit Collar”—again these are all marketing terms used by Scarpa but they work so well that I just have to mention them—basically the collar they are using on this boot is extremely soft and flexible. I’ve found this does two things. One~ it doesn’t add any pressure to the back of the achilles~ and two~ it does a wonderful job of keeping any snow~ scree~ dirt~ rocks~ etc~ out of the boot even when wearing them without any gaiters.    There is also memory foam along the back of the heel that literally hugs your ankle. I’m also gonna add the one-piece tongue into this section as I feel it works in conjunction with the collar to provide solid support without any hot sports or bunching.       The lacing runs right to the toe and has a set of locking hooks at the flexing point of the ankle. It’s a pretty standard feature these days~ but works well in allowing you to individualize the tightness above~ and below~ the ankle.   The weight of these boots is 24.8 oz which undoubtedly makes them more comfortable to wear all day. I’m not someone who usually notices the weight of boots~ (*I am usually wearing a pair of Limmer lightweights even when I’m not hiking~ don’t let the name fool you) but putting these on is like wearing trail runners with more support.      Weather Resistance/Temperature Control   This winter has been an odd one here in the Northeast—many unseasonably warm days often alternating with well below freezing days. It has caused an awkward build up of ice on many of the trails~ which are often thin and covering some large puddle or pothole.    These boots are unquestionably waterproof—like ""stand in a stream~ repeated freezing/thawing"" waterproof. I put these boots through a ringer of wet environments~ many that they weren't even designed for~ only to come away impressed~ and dry. With 1.8mm of Perwanger Suede and a Gore-tex lining between you and the water you are pretty much assured of staying dry.    My feet generally run cold to begin with so I don’t often overheat in boots~ and obviously almost never overheat in winter. I’d say on this front the testing is inconclusive. The warmest days I wore these was at about 7 degrees Celsius and I didn’t feel sweaty or clammy feet.          Another thing I love about these boots is the large rubber rand that runs the entirety of the boot. It's another layer of protection~ for times like kicking in steps into hard icy slopes~ and another layer against water getting in.   Potential drawback? The top of the footbox is relatively flat which allows snow to sit on top. It hasn’t leaked~ and shows no signs of it~ but even if you knock it off routinely it piles back up quickly.          Construction and Durability   So far~ so good. I haven’t managed to damage these boots at all and given the quality of materials used (1.8mm Perwanger Suede~ Gore-Tex~ Vibram) and the thoughtful construction (rubber rand)~ I wouldn’t expect to. The metal eyelets embedded into the suede should outlast the lifetime of the boot and asymmetrical cut of the laces on the toe shows the attention to the little details. Even the rubber rand comes farthest along the big toe~ the area where conceivably would take the brunt of damage kicking in steps~ etc..      The Vibram soles show no sign of wear~ not that winter is particularly hard on boot soles. They’ve most often been covered with some form of traction device.   There is some zigzag stitching along the outstep of the boot. Not sure how much of that is out of necessity and how much of it is for show~ but they are exposed and at a prime area for abrasion. They haven’t frayed at all but they are an area I’d be interested in monitoring long term. Should they show signs they would be very easy to cover with some seam grip and they’d probably be better than new~ although uglier.      Warning: petty gripe to come….I find the colour of these a little off putting. I know~ I know~ I’m grasping at straws here trying to find some constructive criticism. It’s starting to grow on me~ but the orange is quite bright and with the addition of a little dirt has turned into an unappealing orange. Comfort beats colour though~ so they're still a winner.   Conclusion   These Scarpa Zodiac Tech boots can do a little bit of everything. Whether you're looking for a winter hiking boot~ an approach boot~ a three-season mountaineering boot~ or a boot for light glacial travel and non technical peaks~ these should be in consideration. The fit is spot on~ it's very lightweight~ and it's made with high quality materials. As with all boots~ it is best to try them on in person~ ideally by an experienced boot fitter.   Conditions   These Scarpa Zodiac Tech boots have been tested for over four months in Ontario~ Canada. Temperatures ranged from -23°C to +12°C (-9.4° f to 53.6° f) and across varying terrain—rocky ridges to pine forest floors~ sandstone to scree. At this point they have roughly 150 kms on them and show no signs of wear. They have also been worn with Petzl crampons~ Hillsound Trail crampons~ and snowshoes.       My thanks to Trailspace and Scarpa for the opportunity to test these boots."
553,evolv,cruzer-psyche,4.5,   Well-made shoe that does the job and is super lightweight. Fits well.    Pros   Cons   The Evolv Cruzer Psyche is a very conventionally-designed shoe that came AFTER the Evolv Cruzer~ which has an unconventional upper in the heel area. Its one departure from classic shoe construction is an overlapping slit instead of a tongue. This non-tongue seems to work just fine~ makes entry a touch easier~ and is very comfortable.    I don't climb; I hike and backpack in this shoe with 30 pounds or less on my back~ no poles~ on New England's rocky and wet trails. But as a cyclo-tourist~ I utilize the approach shoe concept for the same reasons as climbers do. In my many decades of bicycle touring I have made the occasional hike in my bicycling shoes (one reason I prefer mountain bike racing shoes for touring)~ but as I hike more lately~ the mud and rocks play hell with my shoes and cleats. Hence~ the lightest suitable hikers are called for~ and approach shoes fill the bill.   I started with a pair of leather Scarpa Margaritas (no longer made~ it seems) and loved them too much. A season or two of hard outdoor work nearly used them up~ but I'm not complaining: I beat them to death. Then I got a pair of Arc'teryx Axrux SL synthetic shoes~ which I also loved~ but~ alone among all shoes I have ever owned~ they developed a toxic stink that I could not get rid of.   So then I got these Evolv Cruz Psyche shoes~ canvas. Despite the muck and goo I have dragged them through~ they still smell fresh. I throw them in the washing machine frequently~ in with my clothes. No problem. They take longer to dry than even my leather shoes (which I also throw in the laundry~ by the way). And even the dew on the morning grass will wet them through. Other canvas products resist water better~ so I don't know what's up with that. On a three-day hike that means wet feet all the time. But you know what? It seems worth it. They do everything else so well~ and weigh so little~ and look so good~ that I can pull my merino-wool socks on~ stick my feet in damp shoes~ and be happy all day.    They seem like they are well made~ and they are certainly holding up well after a season of frequent use. I don't baby them. As for grip on various surfaces~ it is good or better than any light shoe I have tried. If I run across a lighter shoe that I like the looks of~ I will probably give then a try too~ but these get no complaints from me. I am the curmudgeon minimalist~ and these suit me fine.   Experience   As mentioned above~ I have owned other approach shoes; I used these unladen or with under 30 pounds of load in rocky~ wet New England for a year~ which is to say~ a dozen times on the trail and a couple dozen times around the farm or around town. 
554,salewa,mountain-trainer,3.5,   This is a robust~ grippy~ if heavy and stiff soled~ shoe that is great for rocky off-track terrain with a backpack.   Pros   Cons   This review is for the non-Goretex version~ which is the same shoe as the Goretex model sans membrane.   I bought a pair last year and they are great for scrambling on talus slopes + general backpacking.   Fit   The shoe is suitable for those with a wider and low volume foot~ which can be difficult to shop for. They are wider than the wide fit version of the Asolo Fugitive~ for example~ but just as stiff although they feel softer in the tread due to the softer rubber compound.   I have modified the shoe by drilling out a new lace hole further down the ‘Y’ section. This is so I could get an effective heel lock with the laces—to accommodate the stiff sole. Without this I was getting heel slippage as I couldn't tighten the lace tops without squeezing my forefoot. This is a problem with such a stiff sole and a shoe upper. Salewa should realize that you can't convert a boot into a shoe without modification.   Comfort   Quite soft underfoot which belies the stiff sole. I wear mine with a 15kg pack with no issues except I now find the soles a little stiff after progressing to more flexible footwear over the last couple of years. They are designed for edging~ via ferrata etc~ so I can forgive them for being fit-for-purpose.   The sole grips very well~ I think~ and has good protection underfoot from rocks. I am happy bridging over rock points on talus slopes with a backpack~ hopping across boulder fields etc with these shoes. The stiff sole can limit comfort over the day.   One problem with the stiff sole is that the platform can lever your ankle suddenly when mis-stepping on loose terrain~ walking laterally across slopes or on rock points—always a problem with stiff footwear as proprioception is reduced and lever moment is increased.   Support   I wear these with a 15kg backpack off track and on rocky terrain. No problems there.   Water Resistance   Nil really~ once water gets above the ankle.  Heavy and stays wet once soaked. Does not let water drain. Limits applicability of shoe in my opinion.   Traction   Traction is excellent on all surfaces. This is a real highlight of the shoe.   Temp Control   Not a feature of this shoe. Only tested from freezing to around 30 degrees celcius.    Ease of Use   Some flaws with getting an effective heel lock—as above.   Features   Unusual seeing such a formidably protective sole and upper on a shoe. I really think this replaces a boot for those who don't want a redundant upper.     Construction & Durability:   Good thus far. Have taken it off track~ the rubber rand and sole and upper are very robust. It's a tank.   Conditions   Off track on granite slabs~ talus~ scrub~ and wet~ boggy mountainous country. With jeans at the pub.   Opinion   If I continue to use these shoes for all my backpacking (I pretty much use them for scrambling routes now) I will drill some drain holes through the leather as well as they do not drain well after creek crossings. The leather also soaks up plenty of water making a heavy shoe even heavier.   It also needs a better lacing system to accommodate the stiff sole with a low upper. As it stands I could not tighten the laces over the top lace holes to prevent heel slippage without really uncomfortably squeezing the lower shoe. A hiking type shoe should accommodate a looser lower (if desired) and an upper heel lock. The boot version obviously accommodates this as it has more lace holes in the upper to accomplish a heel lock.   If they produced this shoe with a ballistic nylon hybrid upper as well~ it would be an ideal backpacking shoe for rocky off-track terrain.   As it stands these shoes are limited to mountain walks in dryish conditions—not because I am afraid to get my feet wet—but because these shoes stay pretty wet and heavy when they invariably get damp.
555,salewa,mountain-trainer,5.0,   I have been forever looking for a hiking boot modeled after the vintage light~ split-grain Austrian kletterboot. Sometimes change should be questioned.   I have been hiking this season in Lowa boots and Merrell Moabs depending upon the terrain. I prefer the boot's stiffer sole on steeper hikes and ascents with snow encounters~ but have issues with poor ankle flex in the boot on descent.    I was headed to Aspen for a couple days and was desperate to find suitable footwear for the steep peak trails out of Maroon Lake TH. After a couple hours of internet searching the night before~ I decided upon the Salewa MT~ which I purchased at a local retailer first thing the next morning. The size 9.5 fit my 9.5 size foot perfectly. I returned home to quickly break the shoes in during a pre-departure hillside lawn-mowing exercise.    After three days in these shoes I can favorably report that the stiff sole stands strongly on small edges~ kicks steps across low angle snow~ and holds securely on high angle trails and talus hopping.  No blisters and no signs of abnormal wear.  The low cut allows full ankle flex~ making steep descents more like a ballet than a gorilla dance. The Salewa MT is light~ tight and overall an awesome piece of mountain footwear.    This German (made in Vietnam) technical hiking shoe ist Vunderbarr!!
556,garmont,dragontail-mnt-gtx,5.0,   If you want a traditional approach shoe this probably isn't it. If you want a low cut boot with the stiffness and support of a heavy backpacking boot~ you found it!   Pros   Cons   Garmont calls this an approach shoe~ and it's in the approach section of this website~ but I wouldn't call it that. It's more like if you took a heavy~ supportive backpacking boot~ and just cut it down into a low cut hiking shoe. To me an approach shoe has sticky rubber with a sensitive sole~ and the ability to really cinch it down hard to approximate a climbing shoe. If you're looking for that~ don't buy this shoe!   I was looking for a low cut boot that can handle high miles with heavy loads (40-50 pounds) without feeling the trail through the sole~ and climb 3rd/4th class ridges out here in Colorado. This fits the bill perfectly. In fact~ I'm not sure there's anything else like this on the market in the U.S. Most hiking shoes are little more than trail runners and this is definitely NOT like that. These things are tanks.   The MNT is really well made. Overbuilt almost. The sole and uppers shoe very little wear after several weekend pack trips and a bunch of ridges. It seems like it should last for years.   The fit is a bit on the small side so I sized up one whole size. If you are really only planning on climbing in this you could go smaller~ of course. There's plenty of room in the toes~ but the laces cinch that down easily if needed.   Break-in is minimal and I was able to immediately use these as intended. That will depend on your foot shape of course.   The sole offers a bit more traction than a typical vibram boot sole. It's not quite sticky rubber~ but that would wear too fast for my intended use. It is noticeably better than the Scarpa boots I have been doing ridge climbs with~ especially edging. It does not want to roll like the Kailash does. Yet~ I don't notice any less traction on loose dirt or scree. There is plenty of tread. (Again~ unlike typical approach shoes...)   Support is great. I feel like I can stand on any portion of the sole~ with a heavy pack~ and the shoe won't deform or twist. I.e. rock hopping on talus. That's the mark of a good backpacking boot in my opinion. I do have strong ankles though so I don't need a higher cut boot.    Overall comfort is very nice. There's a lot of cushion in the sole~ and I can't really feel much of the trail through it. I need that to put on big miles with a heavy pack~ otherwise my feet get sore and tired. The MNT has added cushioning in the forefoot and you can really feel it.    The only potential issue I can see is the heel lock. It may turn out to be a double edged sword. It works really well to keep your heel back in the pocket and eliminate slipping~ but it's made out of exposed webbing. I tend to be really hard on boots on the inside of my ankles~ right where that webbing is.    I expect this to be the first part of the boot to fail~ but it does look to be replaceable so hopefully that's no big deal. I thought about knocking the overall rating down to a 4.5 because of this design~ but... it hasn't failed yet or shown any wear after a few months.   In conclusion~ if you're looking for a low cut~ heavy duty shoe~ give this a shot. Skip it if you need sensitivity on the rock.
557,garmont,dragontail-mnt-gtx,2.5,   Very solid hiking shoes; but they are not entirely comfortable.   Pros   Cons   These are superbly-made shoes~ heavy duty hiking shoes rather than a boots; but~ so far~ I am not entirely happy with them. The problem is the sizing. I have LOWA and Hanwag shoes and boots~ all in European size 42; but the Garmont runs small in both length and width and I do not have wide feet. Being fairly rigid~ they may need to be broken in; but I have never had this issue with shoes of any kind before.    I ordered the shoes through a local outdoor clothing shop; and I am thinking of trying the half size above and possibly buying those. It just goes to show that trying on shoes in a store~ even wearing good socks~ is not always a suitable test.   Experience   I have a fair amount of experience. I am a keen amateur hiker~ but not a mountaineer. During the past five days~ I have hiked over 40 miles and up and down 8~000 feet.
558,five-ten,access-mesh,3.5,   The Five Ten Access Mesh is a lightweight~ low cut approach shoe that offers superior traction~ support~ and breathability. The Access Mesh would be best for someone looking for an all around Access shoe (get it?)~ whether that is an approach for climbing~ hopping on a flat pedal bike for the day~ or light duty scrambling (maybe up to low fifth class). They could make some improvements by adding a heel loop to clip them to your harness and extending the lacing to the toe.   Pros   Cons       PREAMBLE   First we need to address the question of what is an approach shoe~ and what should it do? Quite simply an approach shoe is anything you wear to get to your climbing destination—boots~ shoes~ runner~ etc. To me an approach shoe must be primarily three things—lightweight~ grippy~ and supportive. I want something that isn’t going to tire my feet out before a day of cramming them into climbing shoes~ provide solid footing for hiking or scrambling and provide support from twisting an ankle or sharp rocks under foot. If they can climb a little~ and keep you from having to cram on your climbing shoes till a little later~ I guess thats a bonus as well.    To be honest~ a standard old trail runner often meets two of those three criteria. So why do I need a whole new pair of shoes? Well you don’t NEED them. Honestly~ before testing these shoes I just wore whatever the oldest~ most beat up pair of runners I currently owned was. After testing~ I reach for these~ every time~ even with the few flaws I’ve found in them. Here’s why...      FIT/COMFORT   I have a very narrow heel through to the ball of my foot with average toe splay and a medium arch. I have found the Access to be too wide both in the heel and the mid foot. The toe box is nice and roomy~ which is especially helpful on downhills as I’ve never experienced any banging. It certainly aids in the approach but the lack of “to the toe lacing” definitely hinders its climbing ability.    Don’t get me wrong~ mild climbing is still no problem~ but compared to something like the Guide Tennie with lacing running right to the toe and the narrower toe box~ it certainly won’t match.   The arch support is great and I’ve found my feet aren’t tired even after wearing these upwards of six hours a day. The lacing system is well designed and tightening the laces pulls in the back of the heel through a rubber exoskeleton. I’ve found it helps to take up some of the volume of the heel but I have to wear them really cranked down. From reading others opinions on these I am in the minority. As I’ve said I have the classic La Sportiva last of a foot~ so if you're anywhere near a slightly narrow to medium heel these would fit great.      I wore these out of the box on a light hike the day after I received them. No blisters at all even though the fit wasn’t spot on. The tongue is nicely padded to even tightening the laces up hard doesn’t amount to a lot of pressure over the top of the foot.   A toe cap comes up nice and high to prevent you from getting overzealous while jumping rock to rock. Well~ maybe not prevent~ but at least minimizes the pain.   At only a little over 14 ounces they certainly aren’t the lightest option you could pick~ but are far from bruisers and are a welcome comfort after a day of climbing.      WEATHER RESISTANCE   None. They are all mesh across the top! What are you looking for!    Where this does help though is in the breathability of the shoe. It’s been a brutally hot summer and even into the start of the fall and the mesh shoe~ paired with a low cut merino socks is the perfect combo. Five Ten does make the same shoe in a nubuck leather upper (reviewed there) which offer slightly more weather protection.   Notice the key word~ slightly. They both still wet out within minutes~ but you’ll add some durability in the leather model. That water weight that is absorbed can be less than enjoyable if you're dragging these shoes up behind you (see: wet butt and legs from hanging them off your harness).      TRACTION   Now we’re into the meat and potatoes of where this shoes makes its living. The Stealth S1 rubber. Originally designed for the Five Ten climbing shoes it's been adapted and put into a dotted pattern sole to give you confidence you’ve never had before. These things stick like glue (especially if you’re cheap like me and are used to wearing old~ worn down running shoes).    Taking inspiration from their climbing shoes the ability of the the Access to smear and edge is something often not found on approach shoes. The midsole is stiff enough to support the weight without a lot of foot fatigue all the while not sacrificing the ground feel or sensitivity. These are certainly not running shoes~ and you’d be foolish to mistake them as such. There is very little rebound to the midsole. The dot pattern and the quality rubber make even the most polished limestone~ shale~ and granite that I’ve had the chance to use them on seem like I’m walking on a boardwalk.      I do wish there was a completely flat area on the toe instead of continuing the dot pattern. It is a thicker rubber across the toe to add some durability.       The mid foot is fairly flexible which aids in the shoes ability to smear and to provide a wide~ stable grippy area of friction against rock. The sole is a little stiffer~ and thicker~ than I would like~ but I think that’s to compensate for the softness and (relatively) quicker wearing of the rubber. You can read about that below.      CONSTRUCTION AND DURABILITY   The Access is offered in two different models~ one with a nubuck leather upper and this one with a mesh upper. As you can imagine they have a significant gap in terms of abrasion resistance. Climbing a lot of granite cracks? Get the leather version. More open~ exposed approaches and can sacrifice some durability for breathability? Get the mesh uppers.      The Stealth S1 rubber wears down. You can’t really have your cake and eat it too. I don’t think this is necessarily a negative. Softer rubbers are stickier~ if you want that added grip you're going to have to give up some long-term durability. I have probably around 100 miles on each pair (probably more on the mesh pair) and the tread is (in my best estimation) at most~ maybe 20 percent worn down. Depending on the type of rock and the frequency used I could see them lasting at least three or four more seasons of climbing. That said~ I do believe this was the right choice in rubber as it meets a happy medium of durability and grip.   Last thought... Please put a loop on the heel for hauling them. It’s a blatant oversight on an approach shoe with the reputation of Five Ten. You have to use the laces (or the lace loops) and it just doesn’t work as well.      CONDITIONS   I have a size 11 or 11.5 foot dependant on the manufacturer and ordered a size 11. I feel like they fit true to length although I’m wondering if I should have gone half a size smaller to get a more performance fit. They have been worn for over three months and travelled with me from my home in Canada as well as on trips to New Hampshire and South Carolina.    My preference (certainly during the summer testing period) was to favour the mesh model. While I prefer the leather model visually they just don’t add enough weather resistance to overcome the superior breathability of the mesh. I probably have around 130 miles in the mesh and 90 miles in the nubuck through a range of activities—hiking~ approaching climbs~ biking~ traveling~ and around town.   My thanks to FiveTen and Trailspace for the opportunity to test the Access Mesh approach shoe.
559,arcteryx,acrux-fl,5.0,   A very impressive shoe with a design unlike any other shoe I have used previously because of the unique inner and outer construction. I would highly recommend this shoe for anyone looking for a durable~ light~ and comfortable approach/hiking shoe.   Pros   Cons   I had the opportunity to test the Arc'teryx Acrux FL (originally Alpha FL) hiking/approach shoe during the winter of 2014-2015 in the White Mountains region of New Hampshire.      Fit and Comfort:   Over the years I have purchased a variety of footwear. These have ranged from sandals to ski boots~ running shoes to heavy weight backpacking boots. The majority of the time I have found that I land comfortably in an off the shelf regular width men's size 10 with the rare 9.5 thrown in to keep things exciting. With that being said~ it is always a risk when trying out a new brand to see where their sizing falls into the mix.   When I first took the Acrux FL out of the box I was skeptical that it would fit my foot and be at all comfortable. The inner liner appeared to be too tight and the stiff outer gave me pause since it did not give the impression that it was very flexible.   However~ once I put them on my feet the previous concerns were eliminated. I found that the inner liner surrounded my foot in a custom feel almost immediately. While the liner is too snug for a bulky thick sock~ my foot fits well while wearing a range of sock thicknesses from light weight summer to mid-weight wool socks. The majority of my usage has been paired with mid-weight wool socks due to the temperatures during the testing period.   The outer shell proved to be forgiving and easy to break in and I felt comfortable taking them on trips soon after I received them.   The lacing pattern extends from the toe box to the ankle cuff allowing for many levels of refinement. This lacing pattern gives the Acrux FL more of an approach shoe fit without being too restrictive.   The inner liner is a single piece that does not contain a tongue. This allowed for the cuff to fit snugly around my entire ankle helping keep snow and debris from entering the shoe. Given that this is a low-profile shoe~ I would say it performed at expectation in regards to keeping out snow.      The only thing I did not like about the Acrux FL was that the liner was not removable. Based on my research of the other models from this line~ it appears that the FL series is the only one with a non-removable liner. Two issues crop up with the fixed liner.   First~ is that the shoes require a longer dry time. The second issue is more of a limitation in potential use. Arc'teryx sells a high-cuff liner that fits inside of its other models. With that liner~ I would have felt much more comfortable in snowy conditions.   While the liner is not removable~ the foot bed insole is removable which allows for the use of orthotic inserts.   Support:   The Acrux FL is a low cut approach/hiking shoe and does not extend above the ankle and therefore does not provide support above the cuff. However~ the construction of the out-sole and mid-sole create a very supportive and stable structure which allowed for sure footed strides. The design of the sole also provided cushion with out a feeling of extra padding under the foot.   Water Resistance:   The single piece outer is extremely water resistant and prevents water from entering the shoe. There are various levels of the Acrux FL series and the version I tested did not have the Gore-tex liner. With that being said~ the liner on the Acrux FL is fairly water resistant. It kept my feet dry from standing snow and shed light water well. It will be interesting to see how this shoe performs during warmer weather when conditions will lead to more exposure to running and falling water.   Traction:   The out-sole is well designed to handle a variety of terrain and conditions. I felt confident on ice~ snow~ and dirt. While I was not able to test the traction on rock scrambles due to the conditions during the testing window~ I have had approach shoes in the past with similar Vibram sole construction and those have always performed well.   Even though I don't want to see the snow go away just yet I do look forward to hopefully having the opportunity to test the tread pattern on the granite trails of the higher peaks in the Whites this summer.      Temperature Control:   I tested these shoes during the winter in New England and found that when paired with a mid-weight wool sock my feet stayed warm and dry. I would not advise using these for long extended outings during cold weather since I feel that that would be beyond the bounds of these shoes. However~ they perform well day-after-day for shorter outings in colder temperatures above 20 degrees.   One question that remains is how well this shoe will wick sweat from my feet during the warmer summer months. If I am able to continue testing I will provide an update.   Features:   There are two features which set this shoe apart from any other approach/hiking shoe I have worn. First~ is the inner liner~ and second is the outer shell.   Arc'teryx claims the inner liner has an “Adaptive Fit” and I found this claim to be accurate. The stretch material used in the liner's construction wrapped perfectly around my foot and with no seams~ I had no areas that created pressure or discomfort.   The upper is what really impressed me about this shoe. As I mentioned previously~ I was skeptical of how well the upper would break in. Out of the box it is stiff and uncomfortable looking. However~ once the shoe is on and moving~ the upper proves to be supple and conforming. I was able to review some materials provided by Arc'teryx which describe the construction as a polyurethane coated nylon textile which is woven~ layered~ and heat set to create a smooth single piece construction that does not contain seams. The outer shell stands up well against ice and snow as well as dirt~ salt~ and water.   Construction & Durability:   Arc'teryx did a wonderful job constructing this shoe. The outer shell is extremely durable and has held up well over the testing period. I am looking forward to seeing how they perform against the granite trails this summer~ but from what I have seen so far I am fairly confident they will work well.   The inner liner has also held up well over use. The stitching is well intact and I have not noticed any internal wear in the foot bed. This is going to be an area I pay close attention to over time as my feet have a tendency to be rough on shoes and I find that the areas under the ball of my foot and my heel become worn quicker than the rest of the shoe.   Conditions:   I tested this shoe during the winter of 2014-2015 in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. One may not feel that a low cut approach shoe would be adequate during this time period~ but I found that the Acrux FL performed above expectation.   Paired with a mid-weight wool sock I felt comfortable taking this shoe out on hiking and snowshoeing trips in temperatures down to around 20 degrees on trails with between 6 and 10 inches of fresh snow.   Because the shoe has a low-cut profile~ I found that it was best to wear a gaiter if I was going to encounter snow. This was simply a way of adding an extra layer of protection from snow building up around my ankles.   The outer shell held up well against snowshoes and did not show any signs of wear and tear.   Overall Summary:   I was very impressed by the Acrux FL shoe by Arc'teryx. The design is unlike any shoe I have used previously and I found it to be well thought out~ designed~ and constructed. The Acrux FL exceeded my expectations by holding up well against the New England winter conditions.   I would highly recommend this shoe for anyone looking for a durable~ light~ and comfortable approach/hiking shoe.
560,arcteryx,acrux-fl,0.5,   Like the engineering ideas~ flaws in liner design.    Pros   Cons   As a big fan of Arc'teryx products I was excited to see how they would reinvent the approach shoe. I liked the weight~ the seamless body~ the airflow~ they were very comfortable. BUT~ the first short hike of about three miles with no-show socks revealed that the non removable liner keeps moving around in the heel area~ cutting through the skin of both my heels until blistering and bleeding.    Can't return since they have been worn and the blistering is (according to Arc'teryx rep) not a reason to send them back for a refund. I never had an issue with any shoe before. My feet are not overly sensitive. In my opinion these shoes are problematic if worn without protective socks between the liner and the skin.    There is a good reason that most manufacturers put a lot of thought into a non-abrasive heel design.   In my case a complete letdown.
561,five-ten,five-tennie,2.0,   I am starting to have some mixed emotions about 5.10. I love the stickiness of their stealth rubber~ but I am not fond of the glue they use to attach soles.   Pros   Cons   The Approach Tennie is made of leather with some nylon mesh for breathability. The split-grain is supposed to repel dirt and mud~ but apparently it does not repel sand. There are a couple shortcomings with this shoe~ but stealth C4 rubber soles are still the best traction~ in my opinion~ that money can buy. The shoe is pretty comfortable~ but you need to order a ½ size up as they run a little small   I was pretty excited to try out these Approach Tennie’s even though I had a few doubts about the little rubber piece on the toe.  Retail price is $109 I found them on sale for $32 so I was not that put out when they started falling apart after less than a month’s use. I wore them maybe 10 times. I have run a couple mile long trails~ scrambled up a few sandstone cliffs and boulders in Zion. I even crossed the river in them a few times.   As you can see from the picture the rubber on the toe has started to peel and the sole is starting to separate in a few spots.  
562,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   Beautiful wide footed shoe~ feels very solid walking on rocks and trail terrain; excellent grip.    Toes do not feel squished but can spread out while walking.    Pros   Cons
563,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   Lightweight and great for bouldering and approach. An extraordinary bargain!!!!   Pros   I went to the Five Ten outlet in Redlands~ California~ looking for a second pair of inexpensive climbing shoes~ as I have started crack climbing.     They had a great selection of new Huecos~ Stonelands Lace and VCS and Anassazi on closeout for between $20 and $40. Unfortunately~ none of the sizes were right for me. But they also had some approach and hiking shoes in the warehouse for $20. So I tried on the women's Camp Four's and they fit great. Lightweight with an incredibly sticky sole. I need an approach shoe because getting to the rock faces I climb at locally is often more treacherous than climbing the rock faces themselves.   The fit was spot on. They were light~ around 13 oz. per shoe. I have taken them out for two climbs and felt very secure making my way over boulders~ scree and some narrow steep trails getting up to the rock faces that I climb. They are very sticky. They would also make a good day hike or light packing shoe as well as they have good lateral support.   Plus~ the added bonus of getting a $150 shoe for $20 was mind boggling. So what if they are no longer in production? They are a fantastic bargain at that price.   One more piece of information that I'd like to pass on. The prices on many of the shoes in the warehouse were cheaper than the prices for the same shoes on closeout on Five Ten's website. You get the added bonus of being able to try on all of Five Ten's shoes at their outlet~ so no more guessing on the fit when you order them.   This is important because like all other climbing shoe brands~ Five Tens sizing varies. A 6.5 in an evolv isn't the same size as a 6.5 in a Five Ten.  In fact even within Five Ten's assortment of shoes different shoes are not consistent in size. A Hueco 6.5 doesn't fit the same as a Stoneland 6.5. I encourage the readers go to a Five Ten outlet or any brand climbing shoe outlet near you to checkout the fit and the bargains.   I ended up going to the Evolv outlet in Buena Park later in the day and found an Astroman for $39 and If I had bought it online using my shoe size~ I would have had to have sent it back because it wouldn't have fit. Trying on the shoe before buying it is important. And the Evolv outlet will price match any of the prices on their climbing shoes that are on the web. They also had approach shoes for $25 at their outlet store.  
564,five-ten,camp-four,4.5,   These are my go-to shoes for day hikes. I've done 1 or 2 light overnights (15-20lbs) in these when I knew it'd be dry and I would appreciate the traction due to rocky terrain.    Pros   Cons   I have pretty average feet~ so I'm not sure if that's why I didn't have the sizing problems the other reviewers had or not. These shoes were comfy out of the box with all the sock options I threw at them.    These shoes were also very comfortable during hot Joshua Tree summer days. They vented heat really well  but you sacrifice them being waterproof.    I tend to have weak ankles and opt for a mid cut shoe but the plastic cage around the heal gave these better support than similar height shoes. The tread also gave great traction on all kinds of terrain and excelled on slick granite like what you'd find in the Sierras.
565,five-ten,camp-four,2.5,"   Sturdy shoe and comfortable to wear straight out of the box. No break-in period. Had to go up one full shoe size to get a pair to fit properly. Soft rubber sole wears down quickly at heel contact point.   Pros   Cons   I bought this shoe from a retail store 15 months ago for $230 Australian. (Why do we seem to pay so much down here). I chose the Five Ten Camp Four as it looked like a good quality sturdy shoe to use on my Sunday 5 km walk~ mostly on bitumen road surfaces.   I don't use them for rock climbing or rough terrain as such. I had to go up one full shoe size in order to get a pair to fit correctly. They are definitely a comfortable and sturdy shoe for walking.   The only problem I have had to date is the quick wear down rate of the soft rubber sole. The thickness of the black rubber sole at the point where the heel area first makes contact with the ground is very minimal leading to a fast wear down rate right through to the grey under lining of the sole. The balance of the sole area is only showing minimal wear. They really have not had a great deal of use to date.   Ok~ I understand that the soft rubber sole is designed for ""off road"" grip and as a consequence will wear down faster than normal. However~ for the advertised quality and price I paid for this shoe I would expect the thickness of rubber at the heel area to be significantly more than what is actually there.   My next purchase will definitely not be Five Ten."
566,five-ten,camp-four,2.0,   They're very comfy~ extremely good grip~ but for the money they just aren't made very well. FiveTen really need to address this.       3 out of 4 pairs of these shoes I've owned have been faulty. This really isn't what I expect for this level of product.   Pros   Cons   I'm now on my fourth pair of these.   1st pair: After 7 months started splitting where the toe guard rubber material stated coming away from the leather of the shoe.   2nd pair: Shop replaced previous pair. These lasted fine~ based on which I bought a third pair.   3rd pair: Developed a squeak with two months of light use. I could feel layers of rubber within the sole rubbing against each other as they were coming apart.   4th pair: Shop replaced previous pair. This pair now squelch if exposed to moisture.   They're very comfy~ extremely good grip but for the money they just aren't made very well. FiveTen really need to address these. 3 out of 4 pairs of these shoes have been faulty. This really isn't what I expect for this level of product.
567,five-ten,camp-four,4.0,   Sturdy shoe~ however the toe box is very short. I normally wear a 8.5 shoe and had to reorder a whole size up to 9.5 and the toe box is still short. Took out the insoles and they fit much better.   Pros   Cons   Bought these shoes to wear on approach for rock climbing last year. Originally ordered 8.5 my regular size for all shoes. Had to reorder 9.5 for a halfway comfortable fit. Still found the toe box too short to wear these comfortably. Had to remove the insole in order to wear the shoe at all. Could have gone up to a size 10 probably and then maybe been able to use the insoles. Definitely order at least one size up or one and a half up would be my suggestion.   I was disappointed as I would have liked to wear these more often with the insoles for more comfort and support. The shoes have great support with the insoles and sticky traction on the rocks. I love the look and durability of these shoes.   I am going to try and cut the insole down and use the heel part of the insole to see if I can get some comfort and support out of the shoes.
568,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   My first pair of Camp Fours I wore for over a year almost everyday in all kinds of weather in the Adirondacks. I wore them trail running~ rock hopping~ dry terrain~ wet/muddy terrain~ snowy/cold conditions~ out to dinner~ roofing/residential construction~ with and without backpack.   Cons-a little warm in hot weather~ below freezing the rubber gets a little hard~ they only come in one color (wish they had all black and all brown).   Pros(for me that is)- fit perfect out of the box~ athletic.jungle cat look~ great heel support (feels like you stand straighter)~ feel light to me~ great traction overall (wet logs don't count).   I'm on my second pair and ready for my third (just for casual wear).   As a former Navy Seal I wish they would have had these when I was on active duty (nothing I wore on active duty compares). They are overall tactical and practical and good to go.
569,five-ten,camp-four,4.0,   Took these on a 6 night trip in the Grand Canyon.  Pack weight before  water 30-35 lbs~ my weight 194. This was a very rough rocky trip (aren't  they all) and they held up  pretty well with a small separation between  sole and upper that I'll fix  and live with.   They did well for  the first part of the trip but toward the end their flexibility in the  forefoot and underfoot lead to sore feet.  They do fit like a glove~ and  very sticky.  Best used for approach hiking or shorter backpacking  trips with light loads.
570,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   A good approach shoe. A legend. Stealth rubber is very ok. After a long day climbing the Camp Four gives enough support + stability + security on the way down. Behaves well in scree.   As Michael Chiu points in his review it is not water proof. I am not a Goretex lover~ getting sweaty feet. And Gandolf says in his review it is good for walking Grand Canyon with a pack. I have attached a picky of the Camp Four in GC.   For scrambling and climbing (lower grades) I prefer the Guide Tenni (especially when the dots are faded).   For trail and fell running without a pack I use the lighter version like the Progody/Insight etc or Inov shoes (less sticky rubber~ but lighter).   Hope this is of any help. Happy trails.
571,five-ten,camp-four,4.0,   After reading reviews on-line~ I bought Camp Four for recreational outdoor activities. My foot size is US 9 and usually shoes (Adidas~ LL Bean~ Timberland) with US 9.5 would fit me fine because I wear Midweight SmartWool. I find Camp Four at US 9.5 to be a bit tighter than others. However~ when I want to use them for some rock climbing~ I need them tight. So~ I would stick with US 9.5 when I have to buy another pair (Yes! I would buy another pair if this one wears out).   I broke-in this pair with casual walking and cycling~ but I could not tell if it's necessary. They felt comfortable out-of-the-box. My first big trip with Camp Four is a 3-Day trip to Taiwan's Chi-Lai South (3358m/11017ft.) in January. My pack weighed 17kb/37lb.. The trail was mixed with rough trail~ rocky trail~ sliding rocks and wet logs. At summit day~ it was snowing the night before. So the trail was full of snow slush and sliding mud.   Bad things first: Camp Four isn't waterproof (by design). And my feet got plenty wet and plenty cold at summit. However~ my feet quickly warmed up once they left snow. It is not waterproof so they can provide better breathability and they do.   Good things: Traction and load support. On this trip~ Camp Four faced everything besides climbing. And Camp Four provided good traction at almost all conditions. Mud was a tad slippery but that only meant that I had to slow down a bit. On this trip~ I was carrying 17kg and Camp Four held up fine. I only felt the rocks a few time at the really rocky portion. Since it's a low-cut~ there is little ankle support by design.   Overall~ I give Camp Four 4-star. I really want to give 5-star~ but I'm not experienced enough and my time with Camp Four isn't long enough to give Camp Four 5-star. Five Ten Camp Four is a really excellent do-it-all outdoor shoes.   P.S. I have since bought a pair of Rocky Gore-Tex Socks to provide waterproofness when necessary.
572,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   I needed a very comfortable all around hiking~ packing~ and light climbing shoe. I am in my second pair~ hope they never stop making this one!!!
573,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   Great trail walker~ hiker. Very comfortable and with toe to ankle lacing quick adjustments are a breeze.    The sticky stealth soles are amazing; especially on wet rocks. Other hikers were slipping all over the place and I was walking with suction cups on my feet.    The shoes are also amazingly waterproof? Don't ask me how. We spent three days in constant rain and my socks never even got damp.    If you're looking for a great hybrid shoe I would challenge anyone to find something that works better. Five-Ten Camp-Fours are great.
574,five-ten,camp-four,5.0,   I bought these shoes because I wanted something that was lighter than a boot and offered more support than a tennis/running shoe. This shoe fit that bill perfectly.     After several trips into the Grand Canyon (with pack weight around 25 - 30 lbs.)~ 100s of miles of day hikes in the mountains around my house~ and numerous backcountry rock climbing forays these shoes are still holding up great.  The sole is super sticky~ but is not too slick when it gets wet. I have not had any problems with these shoes.     I think they are great for backpacking~ day hikes~ or just walks in the neighborhood. I don't wear them too much around town because I don't want to wear the sole down. I bought them for trail use and they are great for that.
575,salewa,wildfire-pro,5.0,"   The Salewa Wildfire Pro is~ as its name implies~ an approach shoe. As such it bridges the gap between a hiking shoe and a climbing shoe. This shoe is the latest iteration of the Wildfire and it truly does hike like a hiking shoe and climb like a climbing shoe.       This shoe is designed to go climbing when you get into an area where you need to go scrambling. It will take you from the parking lot to the summit. Salewa nailed it on this shoe!        Pros   Cons      Recommended Use:  Salewa recommends the Wildfire Pro for use on rocky~ technical path and I would concur with that assessment. They are excellent hikers~ excellent climbers~ and work extremely well for backpacking (tested with pack loads up to 25#).    They do not recommend it for mixed mountain environment (snow~ ice).    Design:  The Wildfire Pro is the second generation of the Wildfire. It comes in a standard version~ a Goretex version~ a mesh version~ and women's version of all three. It features a spherical heel pocket and sculpted arch that were built on a climbing shoe last. From the arch forward it has all the room you’ll need for general hiking performance.   Climbing lacing goes all the way to the toe and allows for more support and performance adjustment. The upper has very little stitching combining midsole~ rand~ EVO Y frame~ and Exa shell together in an injection molded process eliminating glue and stitching and thus weight. It is also equipped with the MFF+ a 3-part multi fit foot bed providing for a customized fit by removing/adding layers to adjust length~ width~ and height.   The tongue is a sturdy~ single piece that allows for reliable~ comfortable closure. The Exashell 3D grid enhances containment of the upper and improves forefoot balance. The 3F EVO system provides for precise heel cradling and hold and a guaranteed blister free fit. The sole is Vibram Megagrip~ which features 25% more grip without compromising durability and flexibility.    Performance:  I wear a size 9 ½ D street shoe and most of my hiking/climbing boots are size 10. The Wildfire in size 10 fits me perfectly. As a reference~ I wear Darn Tough full cushion socks but I’ve also used the Darn Toughs in the light cushion and was able to adjust the boot with the lacing system and MFF for a great fit.   The advertised weight is 15.15 oz on one website and 16 oz on a second. My shoes weighed in at 32 ounces for the pair.   The 3F EVO system is common to all Salewa hiking shoes but I’m not sure exactly how the 3F EVO system is supposed to work on these shoes as the vertical leg of the “Y” is sown down to the shoe. Pulling the laces tight merely narrows the gap between the top laces.    This system is supposed to enhance flexibility without hindering support; I don’t find that particularly relevant in a low cut shoe where ankles are already fully free to move and forward flex doesn’t apply.  That said~ these shoes fit my heel like a glove and there has been absolutely no heel lift the usual cause of blistering.      This photo shows the 3F EVO System~ the Exashell 3D grid~ and the sticky rubber rand protecting the toe of the shoe   Perhaps my favorite feature is the overlapping one-piece tongue~ which is affixed to the inner side of the shoe and overlaps to the outside.  It never bunches nor shifts in use and makes for a hassle free lacing/adjusting experience   The climbing lacing system characteristic of approach and climbing shoes runs all the way to the toe and there is a noticeable “V” cutout on the outside aspect of the lacing system between the second and third lace. This ingenious little feature creates a natural break in the shoe when walking at that precise point and allows a nice flex in the forefoot. I wear the laces snug on the forefoot when climbing and considerably looser when on level and uphill trail. I tighten them up significantly for downhill work to avoid the dreaded black toenail.       Climbing Lacing (note the “V” notch in the green portion)   Approach shoes~ by design~ are a compromise between a hiking shoe and a climbing shoe.  These seem to lean a little more to the hiking side of that spectrum with their slightly wider toe boxes but that fits my use for them to a “T.”    I’ve not tried jamming them into cracks to aid in climbing but I have used them to edge while doing third and fourth class climbs using the “climbing zone” of the shoe and they work well for that purpose.    The MFF+ system consists of three parts. The upper part is common to both the wide and narrow settings and is attached with Velcro to either of the selected bottom beds. I prefer the narrow size~ which is interesting in that most “alpine” style climbing/approach shoes are quite narrow.    As mentioned above these shoes have fairly wide~ comfortable toe box when compared to a lot of approach shoes and that allow for swelling on long hikes. There are no instructions for this system included with shoe – only some small pictures on the foot bed itself. Sales personnel at a local mountain shop had not a clue as to how they were supposed to be setup either. I usually use aftermarket footbeds in my shoes~ but in these I much prefer the MFF+ system.      Multi Fit Foot Bed System (MFF+)      MFF+ System in the wide foot (thin sock) configuration      MFF+ System in the narrow foot (thick sock) configuration   The sole is interesting. It is quite sticky but doesn’t seem to wear appreciably more than any other hiking boot.  It has a “climbing” edge on the toe and inner aspect of the sole and also contains tread through the arch.  It also extends up about an inch to protect the toe of the shoe from wear.  It offers tremendous traction on all surfaces.    The only boot I own with better traction is the Salewa Snow Mountain trainer. I suspect the tread on the arch is why these are recommended also for Via Ferrata climbs. (Via Ferrata climbs offer ""aids"" such as steps~ ladders~ etc on preset routes). We have some Via Ferrata type stuff at my Fire Department Training Tower and these were quite comfy on those obstacles/aids.        Vibram Megagrip Sole depicting climbing edge and tread in the arch (This is after ~100 miles)      This photo shows the climbing laces~ the overlapping (continuous) tongue~ and the MFF+ footbed   Testing Conditions:  Since these were out of the box comfortable I took them for about a six-mile test drive.  The next hike was an 18 mile through hike of the Enchantment Lakes in Washington which consisted of large boulder hopping~ scree fields~ talus fields~ steep ascents~ steep descents (some on snow)~ and lots of tree roots.     I also completed a side trip up McClellen Peak which entailed a good deal of third class and some fourth class climbing~ a scree filled gully~ a vast field of very large boulders~ and a lot of walking/climbing on talus. They proved to be awesome hikers and the best climbing shoes I own – period.     This spring I wore them up to Colchuk Lake on an icy trail carrying a 25# pack and found them to be very stable on wet~ slippery rocks and even a wet log or two.     I’ve logged about 300 miles with them and they are still going great showing little signs of serious wear on the soles or uppers. I did no technical rock climbing with these shoes and don’t plan any such climbs in these shoes.  For what its worth here's my take on Gortex. Why would you pay almost $40 extra for Gortex shoes that are only 3"" tall?     I treated these with Tectron Water Repellant and it works very well to have the shoe shed water but eventually you're going to have water come in over the top. But that's personal opinion. Some people swear by Gortex even in low top shoes~ I just don't happen to be one of them.     Conclusion:  These have become my go-to shoe for anything not involving deep snow. (When I get into the mixed mountain stuff requiring crampons~ gaiters~ etc.  I switch to La Sportiva Trango Cubes that I’ll review shortly) or Salewa Snow Mountain Trainers.   I highly recommend the Salewa Wildfire Pro for general hiking and backpacking. Their forte however~ is scramble hiking and peak bagging. These really shine when the trail ends and scrambling and/or climbing begins.   Their neon blue~ red~ and yellow color is a turn off to some – I love it. The color is a great conversation starter at Starbucks après climb/hike!  I highly recommend these without any reservations!"
576,salewa,wildfire-pro,5.0,   Pros   Cons   This shoe is very comfortable~ provides good support and traction~ while maintaining an attractive appearance.
577,asolo,distance,3.5,   Shoes fit well but run a bit large. Order 1/2 size smaller when ordering.     I like the shoe but my only complaint is that the sole of the heel is very narrow and has caused me to roll my foot when crossing over uneven surfaces.  If you look at photos you can notice that the heel is much narrower than the upper.  This can cause your foot to roll over the sole edge.     Prefer the Scarpa Zen or Garmont Sticky Spin or Sticky Cat. Those two are much more stable. The Asolos have worn well and the quality seems to be great.
578,asolo,distance,5.0,   Very stiff for the first week~ but well worth breaking in. Also needed to get 1/2 size smaller than my other pair of Asolo hiking boots. Found them for $70 at Scheels in Reno~ NV~ but still worth full price.
579,asolo,distance,5.0,   Where have you been all my life? I have tried a few different approach shoes and trail running shoes~ but this one is above and beyond all of those.    The construction is sturdy but comfortable materials that I can actually see lasting for a while. I have used them to hike long distances on very rocky terrain in Death Valley. They were great for gravelly washes~ scrambles up steep loose terrain~ and navigating dry falls. The grip on these shoes is great and I would have been in deep trouble without them. Some of the short climbing situations I get into while hiking can be faced with more confidence using these shoes.     They have a snug fit and a nice toe grip to help with the tricky spots. I am a size 11.5 and these fit true to size for me. I have found all the Asolo products seem to fit my feet very well though.     Head down to a retail shop and give a pair a try!
580,asolo,distance,5.0,   Great shoe~ very stiff~ needs time to break in. Order a half to one size smaller than any other Asolo... I had to send mine back for a half size smaller because they need to fit tight.  
581,five-ten,insight,3.0,   When these were intact for the first few months~ I considered them the best shoes I have ever had. The soft climbing rubber on the tips of the sole made me feel like Spiderman scrambling up rock. They were comfy~ with ankle support and are light weight.   My biggest gripe is the fact that dirt would get into my toes incessantly. The marks were on my socks between my big and next toes. I use low gaiters to keep out the scree from the top~ but the soil was getting in from the beginning of the laces. Also these shoes are not even vaguely water resistant.   I abused these these with garden work and long hikes and eventually the sides of the soles disintegrated~ and they were turfed.   I would suggest trying the 5.10 Camp 4's. They look a bit less leaky.   I look forward to a solid breathable 5.10 shoe that maintains the Insight's sole~ with an impenetrable waterproof upper. It would be perfect.   Some day.
582,five-ten,insight,5.0,   Bought to go on short day hikes in Moab~ the Wasatch~ and Unitas. They are so comfortable I wear them as my everyday shoe. Best hiking shoe/boot I have ever purchased! They have the best grip of any shoe I have ever had. Only complaint is that they are a little warm for Moab~ but on the flip side of that you don’t get all that fine red sand stuck between your toes at the end of the day. I’m interested in trying the Five Ten Camp Fours next.   
583,five-ten,insight,5.0,   I have a 4e width! To find a shoe that fits out of the box is an event of near epic perportions. The lacing on the Insight allows you to really fine tune the shoe. Two 2-3rd class climbing trips to the Eastern Sierra without a single glitch... I ordered two more pairs. The durability issues with 5-10 do not seem to be popping up with the Insight. Believe it or not~ the shoes are almost too grippy.     
584,five-ten,exum-guide,4.5,"   Great boot that fills the gap between Burly Backpacking Tank and Wispy Barely there Trailrunner.    Pros   Cons   I'm going to get this out of the way first since it's ultimately not very important. My pair is a light gray~ almost white color. The first time I wore them on a hike (16 miles up Icebox Canyon in the summer so lots of dust) they looked beat all to heck. This in no way effected their performance but it looked like they were old and beat up.    I've worn them for a little bit of everything~ backpacking on the Buffalo River (35lbs load) where one shares dirt trails with horses~ hiking and scrambling on Sierra granite~ climbing SoCal mountains in winter. Worked really well for all of them. The soles are nice and sticky for climbing and scrambling (not sensitive enough for serious climbing or bouldering) and the tread itself is deep enough for great traction on dirt and trails.   The only thing I don't understand is that they made these boots crampon compatible but not waterproof. Kinda limits their winter use~ but they were fine on my day trips.    These boots are very comfortable~ good support even with good sized overnight loads of 30-ish pounds. I've never had a problem with sweaty feet but these boots seem to breath well but also never got cold in the winter.    In winter I paired them with REI wool liner sock and Expedition weight Smartwool socks~ summer I would go with Coolmax liners and lightweight wool socks. The fact that they lace down to the toes made it so that with both of these systems the boot was never too tight or loose.    On one winter trip I put a 2"" gash in the leather on this inside ankle just below the cuff~ but a little duct tape fixed it right up and hasn't effected the performance in any way.    I also own a pair of 5.10 Camp 4's and these are essentially the same shoe with more ankle support. "
585,five-ten,exum-guide,4.5,   trés bonne chaussure polyvalente a tout niveau que ce soit en rendonnée ou en via ferata. Trés confortable doté d'une exélente adérance. un trés bon priduit.   
586,la-sportiva,gandalf,5.0,   I have been looking for 10 years for shoes like this. These are NOT for long hikes on established trails. They feel like climbing shoes that you can walk around in.   I tried them on an indoor wall and they felt like stiff climbers. They did much better that all the other approach shoes~ which are basically light hiking shoes w/ sticky rubber.   I hope more companies make shoes like this. I have bouldered in 5-10 Camp 4s~ and they are really only good for friction or very large footholds. I think these Gandalfs will be much better on rock than all the other approach shoes.   I like to get to a bouldering area and walk around and do a little of this and a little of that and keep moving without changing shoes 5 times a day.   The main difference is in the front half of the shoe. It feels very much like a climbing shoe. And the whole shoe has a tighter fit than a hiker. Which is better for climbing more vertical than friction and worse for hiking.   These are not for long hikes. When you take long strides on flat ground~ your feet will not like it.   But when you are walking around amongst boulder problems~ they are great. Not quite as good as climbing shoes for dime edges and tiny toe pockets~ but fine for all else.   They blow away all other approach shoes for climbing.   These are great to put on at the car and wear for a few hours as long as you are not doing any long distance hiking.   Note: You can loosen the laces to make hiking more comfortable and you can buy a bigger size for more comfortable hiking~ but you will lose what makes them good climbers.   These are made to be fit tight to your feet~ but not too tight.   Standing~ scrambling~ easy walking~ climbing -> you can do it all day and never want to take them off~ but lengthen your stride and pick up the pace on flat ground and you will see that they were not made for long distance hiking.
587,la-sportiva,ganda,5.0,   Super-capable neo-approach shoes that climb “the gnar” and last 5000 miles of hiking. Put the Gandas on and do things you want to do. Forget about them until it’s time to take them off.   Pros   Cons   Best For: Those who guide on peaks~ climbing under their limit~ wanting a multi-season shoe. Rock rats. Anyone who lives at Camp 4~ Joshua Tree~ or Hueco Tanks for part of the year. Anyone who likes durable~ multipurpose things. Parkour enthusiasts.   The Backstory: Getting the La Sportiva Gandas was a process in itself. I had read reviews online and heard accounts (side note: these are the same shoes as the Gandalf model; I assume a few people had a problem with that name being used...) but it wasn’t until I stood in front of the clearance table at my local climbing shop that I actually held a pair in my hands. I had read that they tend to run on the small side~ so I was holding the only pair that might remotely fit me~ a pair of size 45s~ in my hands. A sales associate stood in the wings…   Me: Any chance I can return these if they end up too small?   Her: Sorry~ not on clearance items…   Me: Of course not…   Trying them on in the store~ I thought right off the bat that they might be a bit tight for longer walks. After a break to accost myself for whining about the long-term walking comfort of an approach shoe~ I got back to the specifics: The forefoot~ while being just barely wide enough~ didn’t have the length I liked to see in the toebox~ especially considering it was quite a low-volume~ climbing-purposed toebox.   The one saving grace was that the shape of the shoe fit my foot very well~ almost seeming to be made for those having a longer second toe~ as I do. The tongue was lightly padded~ and the lacing extended down to the very tips of my toes~ so I knew I had a bit of give there…   Walking around the store with them on felt good: my heel was locked down with every step~ and for an approach shoe they felt very comfortable. I was especially surprised with the ample under-foot cushion and ergonomically-designed last that allowed my toes to splay and crunch while keeping my mid-foot secure. I’ve worn a few approach shoes in my day (La Sportiva Cirque Pros~ 5.10 Guide Tennies~ 5.10 Exum Guides~ Patagonia Finns~ to name the last few I can remember…) and so I know that a “true” approach shoe is one that inherently makes a compromise~ right? Either it hikes well (which makes it a mislabeled trail runner~ or worse~ a mislabeled hiking shoe) or it climbs well~ and you often don’t even get that.   So~ I was kinda pleasantly surprised~ if wary~ to find the Gandas seemed to hike well. I did notice a decided lack of rocker in the sole—likely on account of their other duty as climbing shoes~ I thought—but found that the soles flexed well enough to compensate.   There's never an adequate-enough rock wall at climbing shops to properly test climbing shoes. For my impromptu test~ at this store they have a small incline with some rock-like things glued to it~ and a small section of climbing wall about 8 feet high~ so I was also able to test the shoe’s vertical abilities if only a very little bit.   Out of the box I could tell that they were going to be an effective climbing shoe: that lack of rocker built into the shoe mentioned earlier does indeed make them rather capable in the steeps. The forefoot is so encased in rubber that the front is formed into a nice little point~ not unlike many full-on climbing shoes.   A full-length Vibram dot rubber sole~ closely-trimmed and fully-sanded for good edging~ is as sticky as all but the fastest-wearing climbing slicks~ while the pointed toe with flush rubber allows one to stand on all but the tiniest ledges. The design is unique~ using a full-length Polyurethane midsole to provide both cushioning and sensitivity. In theory it doesn’t seem like it will work~ like the PU would dampen feel and “give” too much~ but in this instance—with a PU of this density—it does… It works wonderfully in fact~ surely due also in part to the shoe’s unique construction.   Construction: The Ganda is hand made in Italy~ using a very novel assembly method which essentially stitches two shoes together. The front half of the shoe is slip-lasted as a climbing shoe would be~ while the back half is board-lasted like any hiking shoe might. A prominent~ contrasting stitch line runs up both the inner and outer of each shoe~ showing where the halves were united.   This construction allows the shoe to literally have the best of both worlds: edging and pointing like a climbing shoe~ but with the ability to walk like a hiker. In the store~ when I placed my weight on a small chip on the wall~ I could see the midsole conforming to the hold~ but without the sole’s edge flopping over and collapsing like it might in other shoes. The Gandas are~ however impossibly~ an adept climbing shoe in front with a comfortable~ hiking shoe heel and midsole.   This is not to say that the Gandas do not make some compromises; as mentioned~ they do tip the scales quite noticeably towards the climbing side of things. The Gandas employ 11 sets of eyelets per shoe—for a low-top!--giving one myriad options as far as lacing pressure goes. As mentioned earlier~ a beefy rubber rand surrounds the forefoot~ effectively protecting the sole seam when stuffing one’s foot into some impossibly deep crack. The uppers are full leather~ with a thin~ neoprene-like liner around the ankle…very nice stuff.   The shoes really are well put together~ and it shows. They are striking~ sexy shoes~ and yet not as flashy as some of La Sportiva’s offerings. Everything about the Gandas is well-thought-out~ reinforced~ and purpose-built. They are resoleable~ but La Sportiva expects most people will get around 5000 miles of use before the first rebuild. Though I paid a substantially-discounted price for mine~ this is one pair of shoes for which I wouldn’t have minded paying full price; they simply climb better than any other approach shoe I’ve worn.   Me~ pulling on some weak @$$ $h17...   Fit: I usually wear a size 11.5 in most shoes~ so the sizing of the Gandas~ at 45~ was right in there. Again~ sizing an approach shoe is a tricky thing~ for if one tends towards a more precise fit for climbing~ long-term comfort will suffer~ and it one sizes them too loose~ they will climb sloppily. Of course in the end I pulled the trigger on them for $140~ and the Gandas have worked out beautifully in the long run.   The leather has stretched just a bit in the right areas~ which allows me to lace them loose when hiking and cinch them up for climbing. The Gandas come from the factory with a removable insole that La Sportiva suggests is best left out while hiking~ and put in when climbing to take up volume~ but I have left it out altogether. The foot-bed and forefoot of the shoe is lined in sueded leather~ working perfectly with a single sock. The PU midsole molds wonderfully to my feet~ and I find that I appreciate the extra volume.   I’ve seen a lot of reviews online dogging this shoe due to fit issues and general sizing problems~ and I think it really is unfortunate~ because the Ganda is a great shoe. In many cases I think what has happened is that~ with the Ganda~ La Sportiva has designed a shoe for a niche market~ though they have employed a foot last very typical throughout their product line. Thusly~ especially here~ as in so many of La Sportiva’s shoes~ if your foot doesn’t fit~ your foot doesn’t fit. If you’re not lucky enough to have a foot that fits the shape of the Ganda~ don’t blame the shoe.   Whole shoe manufacturers are off-limits to me because their last doesn’t fit my foot; La Sportiva’s do~ and I’m quite glad because we work well together. For reference~ I have a very low-volume foot~ a high arch~ a normal-width forefoot and a very skinny heel. I do have Morton’s Foot~ with my second toes being about ¼” longer than my big toes.   La Sportiva Ganda toebox close-up...   Performance: Though they did start out a little on the small side~ they have turned out to be the finest approach shoe I have worn. I had already told myself that if they did end up too small I’d relegate them to off-day climbing gym duty~ but now that they are broken in I wouldn’t want them any other size; any bigger and they wouldn’t climb as well as they do~ and yet my toes never hit the end of the shoe.   I’ve climbed some really fairly difficult routes in these shoes—up to 5.10a—which is something to say for a pair of approach shoes. On the other hand~ they provide all-day walking comfort. Really~ they almost force you to think differently of all approach shoes altogether; gone are the days when an approach shoe had to be either a clunky trail runner or a board-stiff wannabe trad shoe.   Go with your normal street-shoe size if you plan on wearing just one pair of socks with them and enjoy a fit more suited to climbing~ and size up one full EU size if you’re a two-sock person~ or like more room in the toebox.   Me~ in a~ like~ totally BS static shot...   The above wall~ to show overhang angle...   (Note: All these shots of me climbing are not meant to suggest that you could also climb like that while wearing the Gandas~ nor should they suggest that I'm a badass at climbing and thus~ have found the limit to these shoes. Meaning~ if you can climb a given 5.13 blah blah blah...~ or V8 crimper thingie in your chosen rock shoe~ then you can probably also do it in the Gandas~ if only with a bit more difficulty.)    The limitations of this shoe are few indeed. Firstly~ the design of the dot sole does not provide much traction in wet~ off-trail areas where a block lug sole would be more appropriate. Simply put~ the depth of tread on the dot sole is no more than 1/4”~ making the Gandas dreadfully slick in mud or wet leaves.   Also~ due to the quantity and quality of the leather used there is a lack of ventilation throughout the shoe. While this helps to keep fine dust and sand out of the shoe~ the lack of synthetic mesh or perforations in the leather can make them~ at times~ much less breathable when compared to a trail runner. On the plus side~ these qualities help make the Gandas remarkably water-resistant.   Additionally~ due to their low-cut nature most~ if not all~ universal crampons will not work with them (without some modification)~ though something like Katoola Mircospikes will work. At any rate~ long glacier crossings might be better addressed with another pair of shoes.   Conclusion: If you climb hard and want an approach shoe that can keep up~ the Gandas have the ability to climb at a higher level than maybe any other approach shoe out there. These are not the shoes for an all-day-woods-romp with a little bit of scrambling. These are not the shoes for a summertime~ sunup-to-sundown slickrock trot through The Maze. These are for every 5-mile-approach-leading-to-the-5.10-stuff anywhere. These are for getting to the hidden spots at Squamish~ for finding geocaches in the Tetons~ for the choss up on the Maroon Bells. Feed ‘em a little blood~ sweat~ and rock a few times a week and they’ll keep your feet very~ very happy.   Like all truly good gear~ one can undoubtedly trust in the La Sportiva Gandas~ thereby forgetting about them and eliminating one more variable in the ever-growing equation; in this respect the Gandas can allow one to do things that would be much more difficult to do otherwise. La Sportiva may have designed this shoe for a very small market~ but that market would do very well to take a hard look at the Ganda.

588,scarpa,zen,3.5,   Comfortable shoe. Nice on the trail and look good with jeans.   Pros   Cons   I wear these from trail to everyday. Nice for everyday hikes~ but a little light for me for backpacking. I live in these. The only downside for me was the thin insoles. I went with an athletic insole and love them. 
589,scarpa,zen,1.5,   Highly uncomfortable but durable.   Pros   Cons   I have these shoes for a couple of years now.   I've used them for long approaches in the mountains and easy climbing. I have a high volume foot and they feel very uncomfortable. Tried them with heel pads~ thin shock absorbers~ different types of socks~ different types of lacing. No comfort improvement.   I feel pressure on the toes after walking for a while and then the discomfort only grows. When I scrambled or climbed easy rock sections I discovered they have no precision for edging. I wouldn't call them technical shoes.   Their only plus seems to be durability.   Not recommendable.
590,scarpa,zen,4.5,   Well~ I’ve banged these shoes around for several years now. Bought them originally for a trip to Yellowstone and have loved them ever since. Since then~ they’ve accompanied me to Yosemite~ on numerous treks to the Sierras~ around town~ out to dinner and just about everywhere in between.   Out of the box~ these approach shoes deliver Italian style in spades. The rubber toe cap provides rugged protection when scrambling up the trail. The two-tone suede upper is understated and natty – all at the same time. The crisscrossed stitching adds to the durability and stylishness. This could pass for an upscale sneaker that you can wear with jeans around town as well as a credible piece of technical gear.   The sole is a special Vibram compound that is both sticky and hard wearing. The Scarpa Zen hits everything just about right IMHO.   I have a more complete review and photo at GearGuide.
591,scarpa,zen,5.0,   I just purchased my third pair of these shoes. They are great. I used them to summit various peaks in the Tetons without any problems.     These shoes fit me like a glove~ are stiff enough for technical scrambles~ but comfortable enough for walking around town. They have held up well to the abuse that has been thrown at them. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a technical approach shoe.
592,scarpa,zen,5.0,   For an all rounder this shoe is perfect. Although I guess that depends on your perception of 'all rounder'. I took these shoes to the Himalayas with me~ and put them through their paces around Annapurna. They were a welcome relief in the evenings (when the boots came off to dry out). If it wasn’t so wet I may have been tempted to try them on a trek and really test them out.    I would use them as an approach shoe and have used them for scrambling above Annapurna Base Camp~ (about 4200m). I didn't stumble or slip once~ and I was trying to find a hard route~ so I guess the 'spyder sole' is as sticky and grippy as Scarpa say it is. Since coming back to the UK I have hardly taken them off~ they're that comfortable. Shame I have to go back to work next week and get back into steel toes.
593,scarpa,rapid-lt,4.5,   A real challenger. Lightweight with minimalist comfort~ and modern design. An excellent light trail shoe with good traction and good foot protection.   Pros   Cons         Introduction   Part of Scarpa's planet-friendly product line~ the Scarpa Rapid LT is first and foremost a light and nimble alpine shoe. Like its cousin~ the award-winning Spark trail runner~ the Rapid LT offers a minimalist design for hiking~ approach~ and general trail use without sacrificing comfort or foot protection. It's a suede and fabric combination~ with recycled rubber and synthetic components.   While I've had concerns with the narrow European lasts in that past~ I found the shoe to be true to size and the toebox to be much wider than expected. Lots of wiggle-room for my toes~ and the shoes were flexible and comfortable right out of the box. No break-in needed~ always a plus. As general-purpose 'around town' shoes the Rapid LTs were good on pavement~ gravel or grass and they were even nice for driving! Mine came in 'anthracite (dark gray)/orange'~ a stylish colour combination that looked great.   Performance Below Treeline   But the Scarpa Rapid LT is a light trail shoe (640 gms/1.4 lbs~ Men's size 11) and the first step was to try them out on a few of the more interesting trails in the Edmonton area. As a hiker~ I'm used to a heavy sole~ high ankle and a solid feel to my footwear~ so I was concerned about the apparent lack of protection offered by the light shoe. I've known for a while~ though~ that my big boots (Salomon MegaTrek 6) were overkill for many situations~ and the weight penalty (1.7 kg/3.75 lbs per pair) gets to be a nuisance much of the time.   The first trail I hit was a mix of dirt and gravel on an Edmonton river valley trail used by runners and walkers.       As expected~ they did well on that kind of surface~ so I headed out for something a bit more challenging at the Chickakoo recreation area. Some minor bushwhacking and a bit of puddle-jumping near the lake.            The lugs on the Scarpa Rapid LTs are quite shallow but also quite sticky. Especially on wet roots and rocks~ I was impressed with how well they held and how solid my foot felt. I would be confident wearing these on wet limestone or cedar roots – frankly~ not something I expected.   Made mostly of recycled materials~ the Rapid LT has a low profile EVA midsole made of 25% recycled rubber and with an EcoPure additive to promote landfill disintegration. With 6 mm of drop from heel to the ball of the foot the midsole provides extra stability by keeping the foot closer to the trail. Unlike lighter shoes~ I found no tendency to feel every pebble poking through~ and a rubber toe rand prevented any damage to my toes. The lower foot position took some getting used to~ but after a while I began to enjoy it.   I also tried these both with and without my orthotics. I found the insole that came with them to be much more supportive than what I'd expected~ but I was pleased to find the larger toebox allowed enough room to wear my own if needed.      Performance at Elevation   My next project was a mountain day hike and while I've been leery about risking a new shoe at higher elevations~ the Rapid LTs worked well on a mixed trail. I wore my boots when we hit colder elevations~ but changed into the Scarpas for the approach and the return. A bit of mud and occasional snow patches~ some slippery rocks~ lots of walking and an occasional easy scramble – the Scarpas kept up just fine. They're not waterproof~ of course (the webbed sections on the sides provide excellent ventilation) but the fabrics didn't take long to dry.    One thing I noticed was that there seems to be no stretch in the forefoot even after a soaking. It feels like there's an extra layer inside intended to hold the shape~ a nice bonus. On the flatter portions~ I even tried running a bit~ and I was impressed with how good the shock absorption is; not much impact and a very natural foot position to help control fatigue.          Materials/Design Features   The list of materials is impressive; from 29% recycled mesh to 100% recycled PC lining~ Scarpa has made a serious effort to incorporate environmental-friendly materials. Overall~ the amount of recycled content runs between 30 and 100% in keeping with Scarpa's planet-friendly guideline. Even the laces are Ecosensor recycled polyester~ and Scarpa promises that the use of that kind of materials won't compromise either durability or performance. While it's still early in the game~ so far I've seen no reason to doubt them.   Other design features include a heel that packs flat to fit in a pack and convertible heel pull loops to hang the shoes off a climbing harness. Lacing almost to the toe makes for a perfect fit~ and coupled with the sticky soles~ I could see these being used for scrambles~ as I did~ or even for easy climbs.   Conclusion   Frankly~ I was concerned when I was told I'd be getting a 'Mountain Minimal' shoe to try. There has been a lot of discussion on Trailspace about the new designs and I was worried that the shoes would be too big a change for me. However~ I discovered that not only are they comfortable~ but they make a good compliment to my regular hiking boots.    I can't say they'll be perfect for everybody — people with foot or ankle problems might want to stick with the higher heel of standard trail runners or the ankle support of a boot — but I was surprised by how much I like them.  
594,treksta,granite,4.5,   Approach shoes are trail hikers that are also intended for diversions such as easier rock climbs and scrambling that require good traction~ a secure fit~ and durability. The Granite~ with men's and women's versions~ meets those needs with a comfortable~ stable shoe built on a last that is best for people whose feet are wider at the ball of the foot.       Some useful features include speed laces that run all the way to the toes~ a reinforced toe area~ and sticky high-traction soles. This mostly full-leather shoe runs a little warm~ and the stock laces are a tad slippery; I have to double-knot them.     Pros   Cons   Basic Details   The Granite is a low hiking shoe designed to bridge the gap toward rock climbing. If you like a firm fit~ don't feel the need for lots of cushioning~ and crave a durable shoe with a high-traction (and high wear) sole~ it's a great shoe.   Out of the box~ the pair weighed a hair over two pounds on a digital hand scale. For my size~ that is pretty average for an approach shoe. The outer part of the shoe is almost all rough leather (doesn't look smooth)~ and as you can see~ there is another layer of black leather stitched over the toe~ to protect from wear if you're using them to go uphill on rocks.          The laces go almost all the way to the toe~ through eyes at the bottom and speed lacing through loops of leather on the upper half~ topped with one metal hook. Pretty long laces.        The sole is pretty low-profile~ shallow lugs.        Finally~ the midsole is moderately cushioned with very firm foam. This does not feel like a soft~ cushioned shoe~ but rather a shoe that gives you a good feel of the ground. The sole/midsole combinations also firm in the sense that it will flex as you move~ but not nearly as easily as many trail runners.   The positive side of that is that the firmer combination better protects your feet from hard rocks.        Fit   The relatively thin insole provides limited cushioning~ but that's about it.      I generally get approach shoes a half size larger than normal to limit the risk of banging my toes on steep uphill and downhills. This shoe runs a bit wide in the forefoot~ so I wear them with a pretty thick pair of wool socks.  with laces that go down to the toes~ it's easy to get a very secure fit with these shoes.   I don't happen to like the slipperiness of the laces and have to double-knot them so they don't loosen up. That said~ this is among the most comfortable approach shoes I have worn. Because they are basically an all-leather outer~ they form nicely to your feet as you wear them.       Durability   It's a little too early to tell after about 125 miles in the shoes~ but the leather upper~ laces~ and midsole should have a long life and have virtually no wear. The soles already have some visible wear under the balls of the feet~ at the front edge of the toe~ and along the heel. Most of the trails nearby are dominated by rocks~ so shoes tend to wear relatively quickly. These have worn faster than some due to the high-traction sole.   Traction   Outstanding. I love these on slabs and steep rocks. The price you pay for outstanding traction? As noted above~ these soles are going to wear more quickly than most.        In the Field   I have worn these shoes over the last 2-3 months on a series of local day hikes and occasionally walking on roads. Local hikes here mean rocky trails along the river or in the Shenandoah Mountains in Virginia~ great testing grounds for a shoe like this. I have worn them with backpacks up to about 30 pounds.     On really hot days~ I changed socks in the middle of the day because like virtually all leather shoes~ these don't vent moisture as well as a shoe with panels of nylon. (Note~ the Oboz Teewinot I recently reviewed has an all-leather outer that is perforated with tiny holes~ and I was rewarded by a cooler experience on the hot days in those shoes).    I'm sure I will wear these out~ because the combination of fit~ comfort~ traction~ and durability is near-perfect for a shoe of this style.     Conclusion   Highly recommended. Good luck finding them~ I had a hard time. It's worth the search.
595,evolv,maximus,4.0,   These have been my favorite approach shoes so far. They're super sturdy and comfortable.   Pros   Cons   I purchased these at a gear sale for $35. I have always had a misconception that approach shoes somehow lacked the stability and support of a hiking shoe. At $35 I wanted to try them out myself.   Unlike hiking shoes~ they do not provide the same amount of foot support. However~ I quickly found my solution in custom orthotics I had lying around~ making them the most comfortable boots in the world to me. I'm sure you can find a nice pair of insoles to provide a quick fix for this problem. They also have a slightly larger toe box adding to the comfort.   Next~ I love-hate the lace ups. Lacing prevents your foot from slipping around~ making them hug your feet; however~ they are a pain to take off when trying to put climbing shoes on.   They are sturdier than some hiking boots I've owned~ making them ideal for unmaintained or off beaten trails. The high tops have never bothered me. I've never gotten blisters or rashes from friction. I have worn these on many hikes including Mt. Whitney. Some may argue they aren't hiking shoes~ but I really like the stability and sturdiness of the shoe.   My only real complaint is that I've tried simple V1 traversing on these and sometimes fall due to the shoes' lack of flexibility and larger toe box. I sometimes cannot get my footwork to stick on smaller holds. Therefore~ they are bad bouldering/traversing shoes... but great approach shoes!
596,asolo,cactus-gv,4.0,   Lightweight approach shoe with a Gore-Tex membrane.    Pros   Cons   I'm on my third pair of these and use them daily. I get about a year and half of wear before I start looking to replace them. Their comfort~ looks~ and waterproofness keep me coming back~ but I have to be careful when walking on wet surfaces. Unfortunately they are getting harder to find. I believe that Asolo has stopped making them.    The footbed is fairly thin and flexible and gets more so with wear. Ankle support is good. Laces are great with the top three rows having metal holes making it easy to pull tight. I wear this with Superfeet Orange insoles~ a big improvement over stock.    I would avoid extended use with even light pack loads and I would not recommend them at all for heavier loads.    An approach shoe for dry conditions~ just as described .   Experience   I work outside and play outside. 
597,mad-rock,fury,3.0,   absolutely shameless copy of the 5-10 guide tennie... But so what? It's a nice shoe. Pretty comfy right out of the box. Very sticky rubber. Comfortable for walking~ very good performance for climbing - really (like the guide tennie) probably the best climbing shoes you can get that you can still hike in. Great for alpine rock climbs when you have to hike to get there - Tetons~ etc. Sized very small. I normally wear a street shoe size 8.5. I had to return the 8.5 Fury and get a 9.5 via mail order.   2006-09-18 EDIT to prior review:   The Fury is not a feature-for-feature copy of the FiveTen Guide Tennie as stated in earlier review. That is a typo.   The Mad Rock Fury is a feature-for-feature rip-off of the Five Ten Guide Almighty.   But~ since the Guide Almighty does not appear to be available from FiveTen any more~ I see no reason not to wholeheartedly recommend the MadRock Fury. It's a great shoe for trips on which you only want to bring one shoe for both the hike and climb.   A couple more quick points. I dragged out my beat up~ old Guide tennies for comparison's sake: the FiveTen rubber is a bit stickier than Mad Rock's in my opinion - but it's close. And the Mad Rock fit was a bit nicer (less sloppy) on my feet than the old Guide Almighty's.
598,salewa,firetail-evo,2.5,"   Solid with a good grip~ but not particularly comfortable.   Pros   Cons   I have mixed feelings about these shoes. I have the non-GTX version.   Used them for several years now in the alpine also in lower terrain. But I bought them for alpine approach so that's how I will judge them.   They have a pretty good grip on solid rock also on grassy slopes and scree. They are lightweight also and durable. But that's about the good parts.   These shoes are not the most comfortable when covering long distances with a heavy load. The metallic wire design~ the mighty 3F~ it's a joke. Total fail in my opinion. When you put a wire outside of your shoes and walk through juniper terrain (for example)~ some wooden sticks tend to mess with your metallic wires. And the ""3F system"" becomes the 3 F word system.   Other weak points: despite the long lacing design~ these shoes do not keep their tightness~ laces are difficult to use  and the sizing is very odd.   Overall~ I don't think I will buy Salewa again."
599,scarpa,cinque-terre,5.0,   Superb product of quality and reliability characteristic of all Scarpas. Been using them for 3 years now and they never let me down on or off the trail. Great for hiking~ running~ biking and things. Buy these and sure haven't bought a pig in a poke.
600,scarpa,cinque-terre,5.0,   I have this shoes since six years ago. They have been with me in Nepal~ Himalaya~ Mexico~ Dolomiti~ and several other places. I used it for hiking with heavy pack as well as running (of course they are not the best in this case).   I consider this shoes very comfortable~ strong enough and also nice to see.
601,scarpa,cinque-terre,5.0,   This is not a hiking boot. But the best approach~ lite hike and allround shoe value I've ever had. The Lunana are 2nd. My big Scarpa boots almost never get worn. Though I do love them!!!   The Cinque Terre is like walking barefoot for feel and control. Use green superfeet insoles beveled toes to fit and smartwool medium mountaineering socks (the only insole and socks that perform 100+% I own 1 doz. pr. of these socks and thats all)   These shoes~ insole and sock combo are equally at home long distance driving~ sitting on the couch reading and for excursion hiking~ or when you can't wait to take your boots off and still have the ability to look like Clark Kent go like Superman.   Only complaint after one year of almost continual use material in heal starts to wear. Solution I had a quality shoe repair guy stitch in leather heal pads. It took one week of hiking and four visits back to the store to get the fit perfect again. But now they ARE BETTER and snugger than ever. Toe nail tite never a blister occasional hot spot on demanding terrain when feet have been tenderized by hot springs. I've even jogged 5 miles in these (only twice)   Very hard to find in stores. I'm not sure why this is. An amazing shoe with hiking boot performance (Note: no ankle support for carrying heavy loads but Vibram Tepui sole sits very low and stable to the ground and grips wet surfaces almost as good as 5.10 while providing incredible longterm durability. The sole will outlast the uppers.)   Max
602,garmont,sticky-weekend,4.5,   These shoes~ purchased from REI~ were considerably cheaper than comparable products at the time. I took great care to get the optimum size that would allow me to do an approach of several miles while still providing an above average climbing capability.     I used them for the walk in to Grand Teton twice~ among other uses~ although in the end opted for rock shoes for the Complete Exum Direct. I would now be happy to do the climb in these~ as they have good sticky rubber Vibram soles and rand with stiff~ flat inside edge (important) - but alpinism was new to me at the time.     They have lasted years although I tend to save them for climbing related activities as they are such a perfect fit (the large number of eyelets allow very precise lacing~ and I vary the tightness for walking/climbing.  I bought them close fitting and the sides have bedded in nicely~ molding to my feet even as I gained weight~ which widened my feet).   I recently wore them on holiday while scrambling on seaside rocks~ bass plugging - they were outstandingly secure. Far superior to waders or wellington boots - which generally lead to heavy~ painful falls (saw a fishing legend fall flat on his back in waders).
603,garmont,sticky-weekend,5.0,   This is the best shoe for big walls hands down. the pair i have now has been up el capitan three times~ whitney twice~ and i wear them almost everyday around town. they still have a wall or two left. i have never know of a shoe that could withstand such abuse. in addition they free climb/edge very well for an approach shoe.
604,garmont,sticky-weekend,5.0,   I bought my Sticky Weekends in 1998. It's now time for another pair. Man~ do they last! These comfy shoes fit well and have a semi-stiff Vibram® sole that works perfectly for hang gliding~ biking and casual walking/hiking.
605,garmont,sticky-weekend,5.0,   The most durable comfortable shoe I have owned. And they last forever.
606,garmont,sticky-weekend,5.0,   They are awsome they have been great. I've climbed 5.10 in these and bouldered v5. They are great~ well worth the 89 bucks and I think they still have some on sale at REI for $9.99~ damn cheap.
607,garmont,sticky-weekend,3.0,   I just recently bought these shoes and although I can't comment on their durability~ I can comment on their function and fit.   The leather upper breathes well and the toe has a full rubber rand... great for avoiding scuffs. The sole is a Vibram design with a flat section around the big toe to allow for precise edging (this is a great idea and is used on my Sportiva Trango Plus boots also).   I think there is a full length nylon shank to provide for some stiffness.  This makes the shoe feel a bit like a hiker... and in fact I would say this is exactly like a hiking boot without the ankle support. It's a little heavier than your regular approach shoe and just a little lighter than most day hikers.   My biggest problem with the shoe is that my ankle is a little too narrow for it. I replaced the insoles and it helped a lot~ but not quite enough. After my first long trip (13 hours) my heels were pretty raw and I honestly don't know if it will get any better. It's hard for me to believe that they felt all right in the store and then changed so much on the trail...   So~ people with narrow feet beware!! This shoe is probably not for you. Otherwise~ if you are in the market for something between an approach shoe and a day-hiker this would be it.
608,garmont,sticky-weekend,4.0,   These boots felt comfortable right out of the box. The old style skywalk rubber soles gripped everything but they wore out way too fast. The company has since changed the soles~ but I like the old ones better. They gave good feel of the terrain without feeling skimpy. If you can find a pair of last year's model~ i.e. non vibram~ I highly recommend these shoes.
609,montrail,d7,5.0,   Great shoe~ get them while you can. Never fails that companies always stop making products that sell and work... I own several pair of Montrails. I can only hope they don't stop making the Vitesse.
610,montrail,d7,2.0,   Where's the sticky? These are some of the slickest shoes I have ever owned. Vibram is not all that much~ as is Mad Rubber #5. Not recommended by the big Teton guide outfits~ vetoed them and they were right - no staying power where it counts; I slipped right off the rock. These are OK for hiking~ ascent and descent~ but that's about it.
611,montrail,d7,5.0,   We've used and wore out our Sportivas in one season~ but our D7 are still looking brand new~ great shoe. I'm also one my second pair of Vitessas also a great shoe. I hope Montrail keeps making them...
612,montrail,d7,4.0,   Great shoe for approaches and scrambling. I wish the tread (rubber toe material) would wrap all the way around the toe down to the tread~ that would increase the shoe's technical climbing ability.   I have had the shoes for seven months and I wear them three to four times a week for approaching climbs and the sole has worn through to the cushining at the toe and heel. So overall I have had a lot of fun with these shoes but I wished I could have got a little more life out of them. 
613,montrail,d7,5.0,   Simply awesome shoes! Wore them up Longs Peak in class 5 conditions to the summit. Stuck like Spider Man on the homestretch~ and practically ran down Green Mountain Trail at the Flatirons over boulder. They watch your back~ and make you look like you know what you're doing ~- can you ask more from gear? 
614,montrail,d7,4.0,   These shoes are Natural Born Illers!! I love 'em like fat kids love cake.      - Chamone!
615,montrail,d7,5.0,   Sickest shoe I have owned! I had four pairs of 5.10 Mt. Masters but they can't touch the D7! I've done day hikes~ rock scrambles~ backpacking trips~ mt. biked and some trail running. Even did some bouldering. Gotta get em!!
616,la-sportiva,b5,4.5,   As with all the Sportiva shoes I've tried~ I love the fit. If you have narrow feet and want a snug fit~ it's a very comfortable shoe. They feel very poised~ a good combination of stiff and flexible~ with great traction for approaches~ light hikes~ and trail running.    I've used them in dry~ wet~ flat~ and vertical conditions~ and liked the comfort so much that I used them as street shoes for a while. They have enough support for multi-day hikes in most conditions~ if you like traveling fast and light.    I agree with the other reviewers that they're not very durable. Almost immediately the top eyes came unriveted~ but the upper leather has held up despite this. After a year of walking an average of 20 miles a week in them~ parts of the soles are worn through~ and there are genuine holes in the toes. I haven't had problems with delamination so much as the soles just getting worn away. Naturally the traction decreased after a while~ though it is still reasonably good.    So yeah~ not the most durable shoe. But if I can keep replacing them (just ordered my second pair)~ the price is low enough that it's worth it. I hope that La Sportiva keeps this model around so I can continue to replace them. Maybe I should just get a stockpile.  
617,la-sportiva,b5,4.0,   I'm a huge fan of La Sportiva shoes and when I saw these on closeout at EMS (in my size!)~ I couldn't resist. I've done about 50 miles and 15~000 vertical gain~ so review time.    Bottom line~ I like the Cirque Pro's better than these. The Cirque is a little bit lighter~ the Cirque's tread is sticker~ and these B5's have a nasty habit of rubbing my heel on the uphill and the top of one of my toes on the downhill. I should probably be wearing a half size smaller.   These shoes have a stiffer sole than most approach shoes~ which is great for climbing if you're trying to catch a toe hold. As noted in the product description~ you really can climb some small features in these shoes. I got up a 5.7 crack with little difficulty.    One thing these shoes do not like is water. Like snow or streams. They seem to hold the water and weight down the shoe. Also~ I feel like the insole loses its padding (this also happens with the Cirque's~ btw).    If you're doing a lot of friction climbing~ I would definitely go with Cirques. If you're climbing features like small holds~ etc.~ the toe on this B5 is a bit better.    I don't notice any effects the downhill shock absorber (impact break system) than the description talks about. My knees still hurt like they always do.   About durability~ I found myself on a sharp slate rock slide and was very thankful for these leather uppers. Literally the sharpest rock I've ever been on (the backside of Sheep Mountain in the Gros Vente range). The front rubber at the toe has a few shallow scratches from being jammed into the rock~ but no signs of wear on the leather.    I wear a half size up in Sportiva shoes~ but now I wish that I had bought my actual size because of the rubbing.    All in all~ a good pair of shoes (as expected from Sportiva). I've dinged them one star for not being as comfortable as the Cirques~ esp. when wet. Still much better than anything from 5-10 (yes~ I'm biased).
618,la-sportiva,b5,3.0,   I'm not sold. Love the fit but the shoe is not durable. The leather upper near the toe lacing (outside edge) on both shoes ripped exposing a hole about an half inch to an inch in length~ which allows dirt and gravel to enter. I didn't subject these shoes to much abuse at all~ mostly boulder hoping and casual wear.     In addition to the lack of durability in the leather upper I wasn't pleased with the way the sole began to break down. The impact brake system strips delaminated prematurely and I had to remove the front two or you are left with floppy rubber strips to deal with.  I think the IBS is gimmicky on an approach shoe.    Thirdly~ I could never get the tongue to stay in place~ it would constantly wander to the side (I'd like to see a bellows tongue which would help to keep gravel out of the foot area).    With that said I have never had an issue with La Sportiva products before. I believe this shoe would definitely be a winner if they addressed the above issues. I recently purchased a pair of the Cirque Pro's and from my initial observations it is superior to the B5. Although I do like the fit of the B5 a little better. I'll post a review of the Cirques once I've given them a go around.  
619,la-sportiva,b5,5.0,   I have had the shoes for a few months now. I love these shoes. They are semi stiff~ with very sticky rubber that seems to be wearing well for how much I use the shoes. I adore the lacing system on these~ to the toe so you can get a precise fit. I used these to climb the grand this summer~ worked great. My only complaint is I wish I had a smaller pair for precise climbing footwork on 5.6-5.7. 
620,la-sportiva,b5,5.0,   I got my B5's yesterday (5/5/06)~ tried them out today on a rocky hike~ and found that I love these shoes! On dry days~ I think I prefer these over my boots!
621,the-north-face,buildering,5.0,   Great approach shoe! Worked really well in the Black Hills and held up to the sharp granite really well. The Vibram sole is super sticky and rand on the toe and heel allow for better grip and a few more technical moves. Extra low cut allows for a better range of motion.    Doesn't make a good trail shoe because of the shallow tread and little support. Then again they're not really made for hiking so if you're wanting a hiking shoe~ look elsewhere. They're ok for light hikes unless you have problem feet~ they seem to put a lot of pressure on my heels. They're showing a little bit of wear but I've had them for well over a year and they've seen some hard use so it's understandable. Overall a very good and well crafted approach shoe.
622,the-north-face,buildering,4.0,   This is a great shoe for scrambling and approach hikes! It's not that great for typical hiking on trails because it doesn't have much tread on the sole~ and has no ankle support. But I didn't buy it for trail hiking.     I have found this shoe more durable than the Montrail D7 which I destoyed in only a few months of use (wore the tread through to the sole in the heel and toe). The North Face shoe has more tread on the bottom of the shoe than the Montrail. It also has more durable upper fabrics. After one week of wearing the Montrail D7~ I had ripped out the linning in the heel! I have had the North Face shoe for 4 months and it is still intact~ the tread is getting thin~ but it should hold awhile longer. As far as fit is concerned~ the North Face shoe fits my narrow foot well when I have it laced down.     My main problem with the North Face shoe~ as well as the Montrail D7~ is neither shoe had a full rubber toe. What I mean is a rubber toe that wraps around the top of the shoe and connects all the way to the tread~ like a climbing shoe. Instead~ the rubber toe rand only goes to the midsole cushining and stops.  If they would have brought the rubber down to the sole on the toe of these shoes it would have opened more technical climbing possibilities.
623,nike,air-teewinot-ii,5.0,   I have never had a better all-weather approach shoe then that of the Nike Teewinot II. Price vs. Proformance no other shoe comes close. In fact I only stumbled on this web site review looking for another low price pair of these great shoes.
624,nike,air-teewinot-ii,4.0,   A very nice approach shoe from the folks at Nike. They are relatively ligthweight~ have nice sticky soles~ are very comfortable and seem like good value for money. Frankly I've been a bit put off lately by some of the 'climbing shoe' companies asking upwards of $100 for a pair of approach shoes; then~ running into quality problems with them!   To get a comfortable fit~ I went up half a size with mine. They are super comfortable now; but~ maybe a bit loose for serious climbing. So~ for me~ I'll use these more for approach hikes and kicking around in than I will for actual 5th class climbing. I've played around a little bit with these -- doing some easy bouldering -- and they aren't bad. Definitely not as good as my old guide tennies for actual climbing. But~ my guide tennies aren't very good for the long hike in...   Teewinots offer a double lace system that lets you cinch down the toe area separately from the rest of the foot. It's kind of an interesting idea~ but I didn't find it to be a big deal in actual usage.    Overall~ a very nice shoe for getting you to the cliff~ easy scrambling and kicking around.
625,la-sportiva,exum-ridge,5.0,   This is the best approach shoe out there.
626,la-sportiva,exum-ridge,4.0,   Because I have narrow feet~ it has been very difficult for me to find trail shoes that don't feel like loose-fitting concrete blocks. I had used La Sportiva climbing shoes in the past and really liked their good fit and construction. So when I spotted a pair of Exum Ridges on sale~ I grabbed 'em.    The Exum Ridges have~ so far~ been terrific. They fit snuggly and craddle your feet; are very cool (lots of mesh); are very supportive without feeling blocky; and have a stick-to-the-wall sole much like rock-climbing shoes. Unlike other trail runners I've used~ they don't seem overally tall in the sole. I don't feel like I'm going to tip over. Although they are slip-lasted~ they have a full-length plate in the sole to armor your feet from punches and gouges from rocks. I have yet to take them on real steep stuff (5.7 or above)~ but I'm convined they will work well for scrambling and peak-bagging with a light load.   One note: buy them large. For some reason~ they fit small~ so try at least a 1/2 larger than normal.
627,patagonia,finn,5.0,   As an ultralight backpacker for the last five years~ I have found the Finn shoes to be probably the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever hiked in. I wear a size 15~ and Patagonia was among the very few manufacturers that supplied anything in a size 15 that met my preferences for weight~ breathability and flexibility without being ridiculously expensive.     I completed a twelve-hour and nearly twenty mile day hike to the summit of Long's Peak in the Rocky Mountains wearing the Finn shoes and had nothing but sure-footedness between me and the boulder field.  That was in late July 2007~ when the shoes were relatively new.     Over a year and probably 500 trail miles later (plus everyday use) they are still in good enough condition to use for backpacking here at home in the Appalachians.     As is typical of everything I have bought from Patagonia~ the Finn shoes are a top-quality and ecologically sensitive product that has exceeded my very high expectations in every respect.  
628,vasque,talus-mid-gtx,5.0,"   Great shoe for light hiking~ walking~ and trail running.    Performance: the outsole provides great traction on almost every surface. It's stiff enough to provide support and protection and flexible enough to break in to a running motion in the trails. Superb waterproofing~ stream crossing has never been so easy. Absolutely dry feet. Remember that the shoe is only 4"" high~ so if water comes from the top~ nothing you can do about it.    Fit: fits like a climbing shoe. Snugs the entire torso of your feet and with the lacing system I was able to custom fit my shoes based on my preference. It holds the ankle securely and allows plenty of room for my toes.     Gore-Tex: perfectly waterproof. Breathes well too.    Upper: the colors are not that exciting. Combination of synthetic and leather is durable and abrasion resistant but styling is average.    Midsole: I like the tri-densit EVA. It provides nice cushioning~ but exposed surface of the EVA shoes wrinkles after few days use~ don't know if that is a mark of shrinking or not. If it is EVA compression~ it is a serious durability issue.    Outsole: stealth is superbly sticky. Going up and down the hill is fun. I carried a medium back pack to climb a 400m slope (almost 45° incline)~ and I felt surefooted and very confident. The way the shoes hug the heel makes a huge difference. The marking outsole is not appropriate for indoor use.    Bottom line: great light hiking~ fast packing~ trail running shoe that is also waterproof. Unique traction and comfort. You will use this shoe for your every outdoor adventure and more.    "
629,scarpa,north-route,5.0,   These are the stiffest footbed approach shoes I have ever encountered-a positive. Uppers are the classiest and most durable I have known. I wore them into the ground.   Over time the fabric will fray on the edges where it's stitched to leather in the flex zones. The look is fuzzy~ but there was ZERO structural failure for the life of the shoe. The all-metal lace eyelets are a bit sharp-edged and will chafe laces.    To me it's a fair trade for cheesy fabric eyelets. I sliced one of those in two~ with a misplaced trekking pole on a different pair...   Service life ended after nearly three years when the impressively hard rubber compound Scarpa by Skywalk soles' lugs finally wore down to nearly smooth. Critically~ the midsole had become deformed from high mileage. I'd still use them but for this issue.   These were tough~ comfortable~ and stylish shoes. I wouldn't recommend them for carrying a full pack~ but for everything else they were first-class. The uppers are still just fine.   I use 3/4 length Birkenstock insole/orthotics for metatarsil  support~ beneath the original footbed liner. My feet are low-volume. Scarpa products tend to fit me well. These shoes were replaced with Scarpa Heliums.  
630,lowa,triolet,5.0,   Excellent boot!   This is a leather boot designed for the hikes that take you to the cliffs (approaches) -- and~ doing some of the climbing as well.    It does require some break-in. It is made of substantial~ high-quality leather. It is not very heavy though. The sole is vibram and the midsole is pretty stiff. This makes for comfortable travel on long~ rough trails~ even with a pack full of climbing hardware and ropes. The Vibram sole is some type of hiking/climbing hybrid. For the most part it is a standard vibram lugged sole; however~ under the big toe area~ it is flattened (like a climbing shoe) so that when you're edging or trying to smear~ you get a bigger contact patch on the rock. The lacing extends far down the foot towards the toes so you can really crank them tight if you actually plan to rock-climb with them.   Downside: mine came in a vicious lime green color - yow! hard on the eyes. Should be fine once they get good and dirty.   These are on sale for a fantastic price at REI.com in fall of 2000. Also check lowaboots.com -- they may have them on sale as well.
631,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,0.5,   These were by far the most disappointing pair of shoes I have ever owned.  After one trip to northern Patagonia (within 2 months) they were totally trashed.  They have a great fit and are very agile and precise on rock but that's about all they have going for them.   The design and construction of these shoes is total garbage.  The lack of gusseted tongues is a large oversight that results in you having to dump out your shoes of debris quite often~ the soles wear down to nothing and peel away faster than you would believe~ not to mention every single seam on the things blew and I had to field stitch them constantly.   In conclusion these are not a good pair of shoes to say the least~ unless you are strolling about town in them and even then you should probably minimize your use so they will last more than a couple months.   If you are not in the habit of wasting upwards of $100 for fun then DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES.  Don't get me wrong~ I love La Sportiva but these shoes suck!
632,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,5.0,   Took these to the top of the Matterhorn last weekend in Yosemite NP--performed flawlessly! Even when ascending & descending the SW slope in sand & talus the shoes performed better than expected.    I was afraid I'd be stopping frequently and emptying the gravel & sand but that was not the case. Summitted at noon and was eating lunch when I decided to empty less than a tablespoon of sand from each shoe. My climbing mates had ankle high Vasque and Asolo and they had as much or more sand in their boots.  Asolo soles were a bit chewed up after making it back to camp...DON'T leave home without them! 
633,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,0.0,   Here's the truth. I climbed three peaks in these shoes and there is nothing left of them. They started falling apart the first trip and by the third trip they couldn't be worn. All the seams completely blew out.   I tried to return them to La Sportiva and they blew me off.
634,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,5.0,"   These are excellent shoes for mountaineering and hiking over rocks. I can easily climb 5.6+ in these shoes. About half of the Exum guides in Jackson Hole wear these for Teton climbs and general hiking. The lacing cinches the toe pocket nicely and the even pressure makes this a very comfortable shoe. The sticky rubber soles provide excellent adhesion to rock~ although (as with all ""sticky"" shoes) this adhesion is significantly less when the soles or rock are wet.    Comparing these with La Sportiva's B5~ the B5 has a slightly stiffer sole~ better for sticking toe holds. But the B5's tread has a middle strip of non-sticky rubber~ so friction climbing is a bit harder. The B5's have more defined tread~ better if you expect a lot of mud. But in almost all cases I'd go with the Cirque.    These shoes are not waterproof and the leather takes a while to dry. They also feel heavier when they are wet~ and the insole looses some of it's padding. They're fine to kick steps in snow~ but expect wet feet at the end.   All in all~ a great pair of approach shoes. More durable than some of 5-10's products and more comfortable too. Can't beat the weight.   The leather uppers won't stretch like the Mythos climbing shoes. Buy the correct size to start. I bought a half size up (the shoes run a bit small)."
635,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,5.0,   We women don't have much to chose from~ but this shoe fits very well! I'm a women's 9~ and the men's 7.5 seems to work. I've been a runner for over a decade and a half~ so I'm used to very comfortable shoes. Combine that with having long toes and a wide foot at the toe end makes me hate just about any climbing shoe.     The Cirque Pro fit is half-way between a running shoe and climbing shoe. A tad tighter in the toes than I'd prefer~ but I suspect anything looser would decrease functionality. The only time I tend to really notice that is in the car~ though - hiking seems just fine. Nice and snug in the heel~ which is good~ and my high arches don't seem to mind them~ either. I've had them for about 5 months~ and they have yet to give me any blisters. They were nice to me right out of the box.   The rubber is sticky enough for a good grip~ but not so much as to pick up lots of dirt~ making 3rd and 4th class scrambles way easier than they would be with hiking boots. (Specifically~ my first experience with the Catacombs at Sam's Throne AK in boots was miserable~ but it's a snap in the Cirque Pros.) Excellent control. Not fantastic in the mud~ but they're not really made for that.   So far I've used them mostly for cragging with a light pack. Haven't done any extended hikes with them yet~ but I wouldn't hesitate to do so. They feel reasonably light on my feet~ and haven't slid out from under me yet! Worth every penny!
636,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,4.5,   I bought this shoe to bridge the gap between my old hiking boots and climbing shoes. I do plenty of hiking and a good amount of bouldering and scrambling around on rocks~ but didn't feel like spending the money to buy rock climbing shoes AND new boots - so I got these.    Pros: very strong shank~ excellent upper durability.   Cons: you'll need strong ankles because of the narrow design. While this is helpful for climbing and edging~ it is a little unstable on uneven ground if you have weak ankles.    Also~ if you are hiking on wet leaves or mud~ these shoes have not so hot traction - less than most hiking boots. This is just because the treads are designed for rock~ not wet trail.   However~ I've gone on several wet and dry hiking and backpacking trips in them~ and done some medium difficulty climbs~ and they are holding up very well~ except for a few spots on the sole which are wearing down - though there is still at least 3/4 of the tread left. The uppers and toe bumpers look like new~ and the laces are very durable as well.   Overall: don't buy these shoes if you just want a good hiking boot~ unless you do all your hiking on and around rock. If you want a cross-over boot good for some climbing and hiking~ theses are great. BTW~ I encourage you to buy them from Oregon Mountain Community.com. 
637,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,5.0,   I've owned the shoes for about a month and used them for an ascent of Grand Teton. They served me very well.   They're almost suspiciously comfortable~ and feel more like slippers than shoes.
638,la-sportiva,cirque-pro,5.0,   What an awesome pair of shoes. I wear these for normal street life. They are extremely comfortable. The rubber is perfectly sticky and works great for scrambling and class 3 hiking. I have yet to try them on any class 5 climbs but I feel comfortable enough in them to climb up to 5.7. My only problem has been the lace~ they tend to loosen up after a while and need to be retied.
639,five-ten,mountain-master,5.0,   I've had a pair of these for 10 years now~ and they have only just fallen apart after wearing them around the world a couple times. I am definitely going to buy another pair.
640,five-ten,mountain-master,2.0,   Sloppy fit due to bulky padding. Actually climbing in these is pretty laughable. Pretty comfortable around town though. Reports of durability problems abound. I haven't had problems with mine; although~ I don't wear them very much...  I can't really recommend these. Try the FiveTen Guide Tennies if you really need a sneaker that you can climb in. Or the Montrail D7. 
641,five-ten,mountain-master,2.0,   They are not totally useless if you want something to go to the store in. I had the shoes for just a little while. Did some crinoid research (well~ I just found the little guys) in the Tetons. They fell apart after only one trip in the scree field. The tongue slips all over the place. My foot does not like the feel anymore.    Not a good pair of shoes. The craftmanship is horrible. Stitching came out after a few uses. I have had K-Mart shoes outlast these pieces. Really just cheap construction. Five Ten cut corners now that I look at them. Maybe their other shoes are good. But~ I wouldn't get these guys.   
642,five-ten,mountain-master,4.0,   Not for backpacking. Great grip. Did I say not for backpacking?   Long lasting ''shoe''.   Great shoe for a trail shag!
643,five-ten,mountain-master,5.0,   The shoes are chunky~ with a thick Stealth rubber sole~ toe cap and rand. I have used them in the Northeast for day hiking and bouldering. They are very good on Adirondack slides as well as rocky trails.     I added a Spenco foot pad to the boot~ in addition to the one supplied with the shoe. I have a pinched nerve in my right foot and require the use of an orthotic. With all the additions~ this is the most comfortable day hiker I have owned in years.      I own the 1999 model (orange trim); purchased from REI mail order.
644,five-ten,mountain-master,5.0,   I was fortunate enough to pro-deal a pair of these approach shoes and let me tell you...I like 'em alot!!!   Some of the approach shoes I've tried on in the past have either felt too much like a boot or wimpy like a lightweight running shoe. This shoe is a happy medium. It's beefy yet it doesn't feel clunky. Would make a great addition to anyone's collection.   I highly recommend using a pair of Thorlos or similiar type of sock. Also~ because these shoes are made out of leather~ your feet will get warm quick. But other than that a great shoe!
645,garmont,dragontail,2.0,   A great shoe that is brought down by a small but crucial design flaw in the fancy pants lacing system. Exposed webbing gets ground through if you're actually out in the mountains in them. Customer service was willing to fix them if I shipped~ but urged me to fix myself....on a design flaw that is sadly going to fail again.   Pros   Cons   Too~ too bad. Had these for 6 mos~ did five alpine peaks in them~ fair amount of hiking and approaches. Loved them until they failed~ as well as Garmont's customer service.   The yellow webbing that locks the heel down has ground through as it's exposed below the ankle~ ruining proper lacing via the design flaw that exposes this webbing to lots of abrasion. Now that they are properly broken in~ they have failed.   Otherwise~ these perform great~ just like my old Sticky Weekends that I had for over 10 years. Cust svc at Garmont~ though speedy with their reply~ told me to get some webbing from a gear shop and they would tell me how to snake it back through there.....mmmm~ nope guys~ you should be fixing it for me. They said they would if I sent them~ but seemed to imply that they preferred I fix it. The design flaw means that they will just blow out again. Back to La Sportiva for the exum's replacement.   It's just too bad~ I was way stoked on these as I spend lots of time in the High Sierra climbing peaks and such. Ive led 5.9 in them~ carried over 50lb packs~ hiked thru snow~ etc. Their performance is let down by that one small but crucial design flaw.
646,garmont,dragontail,5.0,   Best approach shoe I've ever used.   Pros   Cons   I wore these on a trekking trip around the world: desert~ swamp~ forest~ beach and mountains. They were once wet for six days straight after walking in rivers. I took them instead of heavy ankle-support boots and they were perfect the whole trip. Great traction on rock.   Only one flaw – the laces kept coming undone so I cut them short. I've just bought a new pair for the next adventure.
647,garmont,dragontail,5.0,   Fantastic build quality. The best approach show I have worn to date.   Pros   Cons   I had been suffering with Plantar Fasciitis for a few months. Once I worked out that I needed some Superfeet insoles the combination of these with the Dragontails has worked wonders. The shoes are fantastic in terms of support~ grip~ comfort and quality.   I have tried many approach type shoes over the years but these are by far the best. Within the first few weeks of ownership I took them for a week in the peaks and they proved their worth all week.
648,garmont,dragontail,5.0,   Excellent shoe.  Takes on varied terrain.  Very light and no break in needed.    I ordered a half size larger.
649,garmont,dragontail,4.0,   When I bought these shoes I was looking for a trail runner that wouldn't wear out in one season. After searching long and hard I came across these. They are listed as approach shoes but could be used for everything from running to carrying a loaded pack on moderate terrain. I would recommend these shoe to anyone interested. 
650,montrail,tamarack,4.0,   This is kind of a follow up of my previous review. This review is to focus on the durability and long term comfort of the shoes.   my Tamarack is still going strong. I like the shoes much more than during my first review. It has become my daily gear - whether I am going for a day hike~ weekend backpacking trip~ or walk around the park.    I have fine tuned the shoes to my preference by replacing the original insole (footbed) with a shock doctor ultra insole. And got a different set of laces for tighter lacing. I like my shoes a bit snug and want to feel the trail response along the foot torso.    The deep heel cup and strategic padding of the insole made a huge positive difference. So I would recommend it.    This is how the different parts are functioning or have been functioning....    Upper: the upper is soft and confirms to the feet very nicely. Even when I tighten the laces hard I don't feel any pressure point or hot spot in my feet. They have resisted abrasion very well. The toe and heel rands are very effective on rugged trails.    The only problem is that the nubuck leather soaks water in moderate to heavy rain. So~ waterproofing treatment is a must and should be done pretty frequently (once a month) during rainy seasons.    Midsole: one of the best features of the shoe. They are a soft PU~ so they provide exceptional comfort and support. Also~ they are very durable. Midsole of my shoes looks exactly like when it was new. Not a sign of fatigue or wrinkles. I had my Asolo and Vasque shoe midsoles wrinked up in a month or so. I like the construction of Tamaracks' midsole.    Outsole: very grippy and protective. The lug pattern allowes me to move fast and maintain superb control and stability on variable terrains (except from the most challenging ones). With moderate loads up to 30lbs~ I dont really feel anything underfoot. Thick midsole and substential outsole (along with the protective plate) soakes it all up and provides long term comfort.    Because the outsole is grippy it gets eaten up by pavements~ roads~ and any type of urban useage fairly quickly. Or on dry rock for that matter. Because I use it mostly on the trails~ they are holding up pretty well.    Bottom line: Tamarack hits a sweet spot just in the middle of the spectrum between heavy-duty high cut hiking/backpacking boots and flimsy trail runners that can cause serious damage to your feet. On top of everything~ it can also be used in a wide range of weather spring~ summer~ and fall...provided you apply waterproofing treatment...     You can tell I am happy with my tamarack...sorry for bragging... 
651,montrail,tamarack,4.0,   Pros:     -EXCELLENT grip~ even on hardpack with sand.      -Great cushioning.      -The best fit possible due to supple nubuck.      -Available in 12.5.      -Like all things from Montrail~ superb build quality.      -The old gray color was very stylish.   Cons:   -Too flexible for any substantial hiking.      -Not ventilated enough.      -Soles wear out fast~ but this is to be expected with grippy soles.         I love these shoes.
652,montrail,tamarack,4.0,   Great trail and approach shoe. Comfortable and supportive.    Pros:       - fits great. the upper nubak leather is soft and confirms to the feet to give a great snug fit necessary for these kind of shoes.       - PU midsole provides great cushion and does not compress like EVA midsoles. I carried my 25lb son in a Kelty backpack (total weight 30lbs) for several 2-3 hour hikes in moderately rugged trails -- no discomfort~ fatigue~ or blister      - wicks moisture quickly       - breathes well      - great looks      - tow and heel rands handle the bumps and extend the life of the shoes      - light weight      - true multi purpose shoes   Cons:       - no ankle support~ but it's a low cut so I did not expect it      - little too flexy      - no shank in the sole   Overall a great shoe for doing it all. And it's really comfortable. I used a Vasque Catalyst and an Asolo Fuego before this shoe for the same purpose. But~ the Tamarack provided me much better protection~ support and comfort than any of those shoes.    You cannot go wrong with it if you use it for the right purpose.    Enjoy
653,vasque,catalyst,4.5,   I have both versions of this shoe. The one pictured is somewhat lower and lighter (non-Gore-tex) while the other version not pictured is a bit higher~ has Gore-tex and has a somewhat thicker sole.   I like both very much and hike a lot in them. Their best feature is the stealth rubber sole which gives terrific traction and stickiness.  People in our hiking group tended to use Montrails before we got into these and whenever it was wet they fell. You could predict who would fall by their shoes. No one falls in these though they are so sticky you can accidentally hit a rock and have it stick a bit when you don't expect it.   Other than that they are good all around shoes. Not fantastically comfortable or cushy--I added new insoles which helped a lot--but I also never get blisters or other injuries from them. And unlike Five Tennies~ which also have stealth rubber soles~ these hold together.   Did I say Five Tennies fall apart--delaminate--and the company refuses to do much about it? Sorry~ I liked them once~ but after several pairs fell apart and the company failed to respond I'm no longer pleased. Vasques are infinitely better that way.
654,vasque,catalyst,4.0,   Good tough all rounder~ very comfortable and the lace to the toe will make sure you are secured in it.   I have the cheaper non-Gore-Tex ones~ so they are not waterproof at all~ but they don't pretend to be. So stick on dry land with these~ even in the rain you will get wet feet.   
655,la-sportiva,trango-guide,4.0,   These are pretty good shoes - enough support to carry a heavy load~ but sensitive enough to scramble pretty well.     The fit is narrow and especially so on the toes. I have a wide toebox~ and the Guide tends to squash my little toe inward.   They don't have any waterproof liner~ and after a few miles in a sort-of-unexpected snowstorm~ my feet were soaked.   They climb rock decently~ but it's also obvious that they're an aid shoe with the support under the arch rather than the toe. So~ they grease off small edges if I toe in~ and I have to remember to edge with my mid-foot.     They're also pretty supportive - my ankles don't feel wobbly and naked when I'm carrying a 60-lb climbing load in.     The break-in period was pretty fast for me~ maybe 15 field days.   There are a few reasons I gave them 4 stars rather than 5...    First~ the rear side of the hightop rubs against my achillies and results in...near instant blisters without liner socks. I think that stiffness of the dip in the back which creates the friction is pretty unnecessary~ so I wish La Sportiva would make it more heel-friendly.   And second~ the rubber is pretty darn sticky~ but only in ideal situations. When wet~ or gritty~ the rubber can be downright slick. I've had other shoe rubbers stick great in similarly bad conditions (for example: 5.10 stealth~ FriXion~ etc)~ but not this shoe rubber (Vibram something-or-other). And on ice~ forget it. My mountaineering boot soles offer at least some remote ghost of grip~ but these boot land me flat on my butt if I so much as lean forward or backward on icy spots.   When all is said and done~ these boots are great~ but they're pretty specialized. For me~ they're too narrow and squashed in the toe for backpacking~ too soft to kick snow steps~ and have too wide a range of frictional results to hike in variable terrain. The best application I've found is long summer scrambles in the Sierra (short backpack in~ lots of easy climbing~ durability for off-trail hiking).   Hope this helps.   
656,kayland,crux-grip,4.0,   The Kayland Crux Grip is an approach shoe that in my opinion is better suited to the hike in than to actual technical climbing. They are primarily leather with some nylon (tongue area). They are not lined with any kind of waterproof/breathable membrane (GTX~ eVent~ etc).   The fit~ in my opinion is just a but generous. I'm usually a size 8.5 or size 9 (US). Most often I order size 9. I ordered size 9 for these and they are just a tiny bit bigger than I'd like - especially for technical climbing. For hiking~ they're fine for me with mid-weight wool socks. Materials quality and construction seem excellent (at first impression).   A couple of very minor nitpicks: The tongue is not gusseted~ so it is possible for dirt and debris to get into the shoe under the laces. The toe rand is not sticky rubber. And~ the provided laces are almost as thin as dental floss~ and are way longer than needed. This at least is easy enough to fix.   For me~ I have found them very comfortable for trail hikes. In fact~ I find the miles seem to fly by in these shoes. Carrying a standard set of climbing gear in my pack (rope~ rack~ lunch~ water)~ long approaches to cliffs are a breeze in these shoes.   The sole has a nice bit of stiffness that provides nice hiking support even over longer distances. The sole is very sticky vibram rubber~ and the tread pattern strikes a nice balance between flat friction areas and knobby areas to provide traction on dirt~ gravel~ talus~ pine needles~ leaves~ etc. Nicely secure on steep descents as well.   They breath well and are not too hot on summer days. The shoes are not waterproof; but they're mainly leather~ so I put some nikwax on them and they now shed water/snow well enough (within reason). I love these as hiking shoes.   The other thing that 'approach' shoes are supposed to provide is support for easy technical climbing. For me~ I was not as happy with these as climbing shoes as I've been with other approach shoes in the past (mainly FiveTen shoes — I thought those climbed well~ but were pretty cr#ppy as hiking shoes).   For these Kaylands~ perhaps because the fit is a bit generous for me~ or perhaps because the sole is a bit stiff~ they do not inspire me with great confidence when the terrain gets more vertical. They're not horrible by any means. Just not great. The rubber sole compound is sticky enough for good smearing~ but the sole is too stiff for good slab climbing. Yet~ there is not really enough lateral stiffness for serious edging. And the toe is a bit too boxy for effective jamming into cracks.   So~ I would definitely recommend these as great hiking shoes that can handle a bit of climbing. If you are looking for better climbing performance~ you might want to look elsewhere.
657,garmont,sticky-spin,3.0,   They are fine as a hiker~ but not nearly as good on rock as the 5.10 camp 4.
658,garmont,sticky-spin,3.0,   Overall an average approach shoe. Pros - nicely padded midsole for longer approaches~ vibram sole is fairly sticky (though miles behind FiveTen's Stealth)~ and the lacing stretches towards the toe for a nice fit.    Cons - POOR durability throughout. After half a season the rubber rand surrounding the toebox started to separate. After a full season (late May thru late summer) the shoe was trash~ huge separation on the rands~ holes in the leather~ and the vibram sole was separating from the midsole. The arches had collapsed.    Granted I wore these almost everyday but shit~ it's a 100 dollar shoe~ it should last more than a season. Even my previous FiveTen Mountain Masters outlasted these. Again~ it was a decent shoe while it lasted but it just didn't last. I am looking into the FiveTen Insight for my next approach shoe.  
659,garmont,sticky-spin,4.0,   Way cool.   Stiff base give this shoe tons of support.   Not the best for shock~ but it's not a running shoe. The sole is the best in the business.   Good shoe for fast tracking and jumping rocks~ but not trail running.   They look pretty good also.
660,montrail,stratos-xcr,3.5,   I have a high volume wide foot. Montrails classically run narrow~ from what I can tell yet this shoe in a 1/2 size larger fits me great. I love it for everything~ it's really lightweight~ really stable~ really comfortable. I have put about 350 miles on them though and can sense they are starting to go. I had a bit too much faith in them and took 'em off trail up some scree on a wet day. The liner gave way and now I have wet feet. They don't have the stiff sole and lugs for a cross country shoe.    I have taken them on some loops in Yosemite with up to 35 lbs on and they did the job right. They are also great for any trail hike as they are very lightweight. I don't think a gore-tex shoe exists that doesn't eventually spring a leak and so can't be too mad at  them for that. The mesh part of the upper is starting to fray~ it's not a performance piece by any means and so say don't worry about that.    Also I put some Superfeet in them early on as the stock insole gave out and they began to pulverize my feet. I think all my off-trail side-hilling has stretched them out and they feel really roomy now. It makes me wonder if a 9 1/2 would have done the job after a break-in. All in all I am happy with their performance and wide range of uses. Again they are very light. The ones I own are the men's version~ different from the picture up right now.
661,montrail,stratos-xcr,4.0,   Great lightweight trail shoe. Have put over 500 hard miles on my pair so far and they seem to be holding up fairly well. This shoe is by far best on trails. The sole is not very aggressive and mine have suffered from cross country travel in both Glacier and the Grand Canyon. Plenty of support with a pack under 40 pounds and a set of hiking poles. Would recommend them for any day hikes~ most multi day backpacking on trails~ and wet weather. Not great on scree~ wet vegitation~ or lava fields. Cool to wear.
662,montrail,stratos-xcr,3.0,   Bought the Stratos XCR for a Grand Canyon Loop Hike Tuna/Shinumo. Have tried various other hiking boots for other GC Loop Hikes. Have done other GC hikes in Vasque sundowners~ sundowners GTX~ Montrail Torre GTX.  Was looking for something lighter~ waterproof~ breathable~ full length shank type of protection~ and good tread on the soles.     These shoes come about 1/2 to 1 full size too small. I knew from other reviews they come about 1/2 size too small so I got a 12 1/2 vs. normal 12.  The Stratos do not fit on the same last size as say the Leona Divide or Hurricane Ridge. Should have gotten a size 13 in this model. Toes took a beating on the downhill.     Also difficult was the lacing system. Could not get the boots tight enough to prevent my feet from slipping forward. The eyelets and laces on these boots really suck. The cushioning however was execellent and my feet were not as sore as they usually are in heavier boots. The full length plastic shank was good. My feet did not get as hot as they normally do even though we had 100 degree days.     The tread was trashed after this hike and since the canyon is a reverse mountain getting up the scree slopes the last few days took a few more steps than if the tread had worn better.  
663,salomon,excentrek,4.0,   Superb shoe with many capabilities. Hard wearing X-hiking shoe with long life if kept out of water
664,salomon,excentrek,3.0,   Leather and mesh upper.       Padded tongue.       Quick-drying lining.       Molded foam footbed.       Super Texon® insole for stability.       Full foot shock absorbing PU midsole.       Contagrip® CX outsole for traction.       Wt. 2lbs. 12oz.    I bought this shoe hoping it would make for good approach footwear with moderate rock climbing ability. After looking at the Exit Low~ I decided the Exentric had better overall support (probably due to the leather upper). The Exit felt too much like a runner.   I've had a heck of a time finding a decent lightweight approach shoe due to my narrow heel. But the Exentrics fit very well. Unfortunately~ the roomy toe-box makes for sloppy climbing (particulary edging). Also~ the outsole lends itself more to dirt and mud than rock. This aside~ I managed to do a grade II 5.4 rock climb in them.   For those with narrow heels who expect to spend most of their time on dirt with a light to moderate (20-25 lbs) load~ this may be a good shoe.  Note that it is not waterproof (and cannot be made so).   For those expecting any kind of rock performance~ look elsewhere.
665,five-ten,access,3.5,"   The Five Ten Access is a lightweight~ low cut approach shoe that offers superior traction~ support and durability. The Access would be best for someone looking for an all around Access shoe (get it?)~ whether that is an approach for climbing~ hopping on a flat pedal bike for the day or light duty scrambling (maybe up to low fifth class). They could make some improvements by adding a heel loop to clip them to your harness and extend the lacing to the toe.   Pros   Cons      PREAMBLE   First we need to address the question of what is an approach shoe~ and what should it do? Quite simply an approach shoe is anything you wear to get to your climbing destination—boots~ shoes~ runner~ etc. To me an approach shoe must be primarily three things—lightweight~ grippy~ and supportive. I want something that isn’t going to tire my feet out before a day of cramming them into climbing shoes~ provide solid footing for hiking or scrambling~ and provide support from twisting an ankle or sharp rocks under foot. If they can climb a little~ and keep you from having to cram on your climbing shoes till a little later~ I guess that's a bonus as well.    To be honest~ a standard old trail runner often meets two of those three criteria. So why do I need a whole new pair of shoes? Well you don’t NEED them. Honestly~ before testing these shoes I just wore whatever the oldest~ most beat up pair of runners I currently owned was. After testing~ I reach for these~ every time~ even with the few flaws I’ve found in them. Here’s why….   FIT/COMFORT   I have a very narrow heel through to the ball of my foot with average toe splay and a medium arch. I have found the Access to be too wide both in the heel and the mid foot. The toe box is nice and roomy~ which is especially helpful on downhills as I’ve never experienced any banging. It certainly aids in the approach but the lack of “to the toe lacing” definitely hinders its climbing ability.    Don’t get me wrong~ mild climbing is still no problem but compared to something like the Guide Tennie with lacing running right to the toe and the narrower toe box~ it certainly won’t match.   The arch support is great and I’ve found my feet aren’t tired even after wearing these upwards of six hours a day. The lacing system is well designed and tightening the laces pulls in the back of the heel through a rubber exoskeleton. I’ve found it helps to take up some of the volume of the heel but I have to wear them really cranked down. From reading others opinions on these I am in the minority. As I’ve said I have the classic “La Sportiva"" last of a foot so if your anywhere near a slightly narrow to medium heel these would fit great.   (The Access comes with two pairs of laces~ nice touch. I quickly switched out of this colour...)   I wore these out of the box on a light hike the day after I received them. No blisters at all even though the fit wasn’t spot on. The tongue is nicely padded to even tightening the laces up hard doesn’t amount to a lot of pressure over the top of the foot.   A toe cap comes up nice and high to prevent you from getting overzealous while jumping rock to rock. Well~ maybe not prevent~ but at least minimize the pain.   At only a little over 14 oz they certainly aren’t the lightest option you could pick but are far from bruisers and are a welcome comfort after a day of climbing.      WEATHER RESISTANCE   I was hoping that this nubuck upper model would add some weather resistance on top of the added durability (as compared to the Access Mesh model (see my review). Spoiler alert...it doesn’t. Unless you count staying dry for roughly another minute or two. There’s no membrane keeping the water out so the leather quickly wets out. That water weight that is absorbed can be less than enjoyable if your dragging these shoes up behind you (see: wet butt and legs from hanging them off your harness)~ and the extra weight of the leather~ over the mesh model~ is amplified.   I’ve had no issues with the mesh model tearing after abrasion with granite so I’m inclined to recommend them~ over the nubuck upper~ as the added breathability is welcomed.   (You can see the progression of wetness over a relatively short time.)   (Mesh and Nubuck models shown)       TRACTION   Now we’re into the meat and potatoes of where this shoes makes its living. The Stealth S1 rubber. Originally designed for the Five Ten climbing shoes its been adapted and put into a dotted pattern sole to give you confidence you’ve never had before. These things stick like glue (especially if you’re cheap like me and are used to wearing old~ worn down running shoes).    Taking inspiration from their climbing shoes the ability of the the Access to smear and edge is something often not found on approach shoes. The midsole is stiff enough to support the weight without a lot of foot fatigue all the while not sacrificing the ground feel or sensitivity. These are certainly not running shoes~ and you’d be foolish to mistake them as such. There is very little rebound to the midsole. The dot pattern and the quality rubber make even the most polished limestone~ shale~ and granite that I’ve had the chance to use them on seem like I’m walking on a boardwalk.   I do wish there was a flat area on the toe instead of continuing the dot pattern. It is a thicker rubber across the toe to add some durability.    The mid foot is fairly flexible which aids in the shoe's ability to smear and to provide a wide~ stable grippy area of friction against rock. The sole is a little stiffer~ and thicker~ than I would like but I think that’s to compensate for the softness and (relatively) quicker wearing of the rubber. You can read about that below.      CONSTRUCTION AND DURABILITY   The Access is offered in two different models~ this one with a nubuck leather upper and one with a mesh upper~ the Access Mesh. As you can imagine they have a significant gap in terms of abrasion resistance. Climbing a lot of granite cracks? Get the leather version. More open~ exposed approaches and can sacrifice some durability for breathability? Get the mesh uppers. The leather model used for this review shows little signs of abuse even after being jammed in cracks and sharp edges.   The Stealth S1 rubber wears down. You can’t really have your cake and eat it too. I don’t think this is necessarily a negative. Softer rubbers are stickier. If you want that added grip you're going to have to give up some long-term durability. I have around 100 miles on each pair (probably more on the mesh pair) and the tread is (in my best estimation) at most~ maybe 20 percent worn down. Depending on the type of rock and the frequency used I could see them lasting at least three or four more seasons of climbing. That said I do believe this was the right choice in rubber as it meets a happy medium of durability and grip.      Last thought… Please put a loop on the heel for hauling them. It’s a blatant oversight on an approach shoe with the reputation of Five Ten. You have to use the laces (or the lace loops) and it just doesn’t work as well.   (Photo is of the mesh model~ but neither pair has a heel loop)   CONDITIONS   I have a size 11 or 11.5 foot dependant on the manufacturer and ordered a size 11. I feel like they fit true to length although I’m wondering if I should have gone half a size smaller to get a more performance fit. They have been worn for over three months and travelled with me from my home in Canada as well as on trips to New Hampshire and South Carolina.    My preference (certainly during the summer testing period) was to favour the mesh model. While I prefer the leather model~ visually they just don’t add enough weather resistance to overcome the superior breathability of the mesh. I probably have around 130 miles on the mesh and 90 on the nubuck through a range of activities—hiking~ approaching climbs~ biking~ traveling~ and around town.      (This lovely tall~ grass runway look is sponsored by ""Ticks"". Ticks—They bloody suck.)"
666,garmont,sticky-cat,3.0,   These are much more comfortable comfortable but less sticky than my other/previous approach shoes (La Sportiva Cirque Pro~ Montrail CTC~ Merrell Jam).   I was attracted to how light yet cushiony they were.
667,garmont,sticky-cat,4.5,   I just got back from my first climbing trip of the season and am really pleased with these shoes. I also have to say that they are really burly. Comfy to stand in for long periods of time while on belay. The narrow toe combined with the great rubber sole allows for easy access on the rock - Heck~ I would even use these to climb 5.8 if need be! The only fault I could find is that the toe box may be too narrow for those with a wide forefoot~ but it grips well around the heel.
668,garmont,sticky-cat,4.0,   Contrary to the other reviewer I have to say that these shoes perform really well on rocky terrain. I have used them a lot in our rugged limestone mountains for easy climbing and have always been satisfied with their grip. You have to consider that these are fairly lightweight shoes and that they cannot be compared with heavy duty boots. They would not be my choice for very long hikes over mixed terrain. The materials show marked signs of usage after a short period~ therefore only 4 stars.
669,garmont,sticky-cat,1.0,   Sticky what????   I'm the unfortunate owner of a pair of those shoes~ which I bought thinking mainly in their scrambling aptitudes. Well I was wrong. The sole doesn't stick at all~ plus the mesh lining on the side punctured after just one day out. They are confortable to hike on~ but you will have to look out for good footholds when it gets steep.
670,five-ten,guide-almighty,1.0,   These are~ by far~ the worst boots I have ever bought. I purchased these a few months before travelling to Wyoming to climb the Grand Teton last year. The shoes were extremely comfortable out of the box~ and the stealth soles gripped very well during a break-in climb.   Unfortunately~ during the approach to the Grand~ both heels started to separate from the shoe. Within about six hours~ the left sole had separated to the middle of the shoe and was just flopping around.  While boulder hopping~ I landed and the heel slid out to the side~ causing me to fall and sprain my knee.   We made it to the camp near the Lower Saddle~ but our trip was over.  The guides from Jackson Hole Mountain Guides tried to duct tape the shoe together~ but it was still unstable and now~ very slippery due to the tape covering the sole.   These shoes had only been worn twice before and cost three of us a trip we had been planning for six months. The guides could not believe how quickly these shoes fell apart~ although one guide said he had the very same problem a few months earlier. Everyone we met on the way down~ including Exxum guides~ said Five Ten should reimburse us for our trip. After many unanswered phone calls and emails~ I could barley get them to reimburse me for the shoes~ even though they had admitted that there were defects in early runs of the shoes.   I will never buy Five Ten shoes again. I understand that there are probably many stories of people who haven't had problems with their Guide Almighties~ but I have never had shoes that became so useless (and dangerous!) so fast~ and their customer service was horrible.
671,five-ten,guide-almighty,5.0,   I've always been a fan of Five-Ten shoes and these new boots have reaffirmed that status.   They can be hard to find. While Five-Ten's climbing shoes are pretty well distributed in climbing shops~ their impressive line of approach shoes and boots are almost impossible to locate. However~ your efforts to find a pair will be well rewarded. (try www.mgear.com)   The Guide Almighty is a high-top approach boot that can also be used for light-duty technical climbing. It has a nice soft leather upper that is well padded around the ankles. The lacing goes all the way down to the toes~ so you can crank them down really tight when/if you actually want to rock climb in them.   The sole is a 'dot-pattern' of highly sticky climbing rubber. The dot-pattern means that you'll have some traction in dirt and leaves on the trail; but don't expect them to give you much traction in mud. Where the soles really shine is on rock - where they stick as if glued. There is also a sticky rubber rand up over the toe and around the front half of the boot for wedging in cracks.   They were extremely comfortable out of the box and required no break-in at all.   I have done mid-length approaches in these (not carrying too much weight -- climbing gear~ lunch~ clothes) and used them on technical rock climbs up to about 5.7 or easy 5.8. They are most especially excellent if your approaches involve hiking up low-angle rock or doing a lot of talus hopping. What I would NOT recommend these for is standard hiking with a heavy pack in wet weather. They are also great around town since they are so comfy.
672,vasque,talus-gtx-xcr,3.0,   Overall: I should give this a rating of 3.5 instead of a 3. Vasque makes quality footwear. This one is also pretty close.    Upper: Above average styling. Nice combination of leather and fabric. Tongue too prominant. I could use a little less of the tongue exposure. Toe and heel rands are excellent.    Midsole: This EVA midsole gives only adequate cushioning. I personally thought that the midsole could use a little more cushioning~ specially around heel areas and under the arches. I have a feeling that the EVA midsole will compress prematurely~ there are some signs even after few months.    Outsole: Vasques Stealth outsole is A++. Great for trail running and approach. It provides good protection and grips anything that's underneath. The lugs are also very nicely designed so they are not too much or too little. It is not the best for indoor useage.    Gore-Tex XCR: Pretty good breathability. Although~ my feet were really hot when I used these shoes for trail running in 85-90 degree F temperature. But~ they provide great protection against wet condition.    It's a pretty durable and study shoe for its build (running last). I use it for everything~ from light hiking~ trail running~ to go around town~ office~ weekends in the parks~ etc.    Great value for the price I paid.   
673,nike,air-cinder-cone,1.0,   These shoes may be by Nike~ they even look sweet~ but in reality they are so badly designed the only place for them is in the trash can~ Seriously!   The boots fit well and are supportive~ unfortunately they are made from a poor choice of materials including rubber~ polyeurthane and foam. The combination of these leads to one thing HEAT~ HEAT and more HEAT. I swear that your feet would feel cooler by walking through molten lava. Even on a cool day~ the heat build up in these shoes is unbearable.    The weather in England is fairly cool most of the year round. I'd hate to think what would happen to you feet in the Mowaab Desert?   The problem lies in the fact that about 25% of the upper is heavy duty rubber~ 15% is canvas and the last 60% is heavily padded plastic.   Although the tongue and the foam have small ventilation holes~ these do nothing to actually take the heat out of the shoe.   Unless you are a penguin and have ultra cool feet I would avoid these shoes.
674,la-sportiva,miura-vs,5.0,   Great shoe that is sure to help improve your climbing experience. I would never think of wearing any other climbing shoe for technical routes.   Pros   Cons   Even though it's a matter of personal preference I'd suggest wearing them smaller than your regular climbing shoe to get the most out of the toeing and edging capabilities. They are somewhat narrow so people with wide feet might have problems finding a comfortable side~ but they do stretch after a few days of use so take that into consideration when selecting a size. Also~ the snug fit helps improve toeing and edging accuracy.    The rubber on the soles has great grip even out of the box. Also~ they smear great once you get used to the more curved shape. The narrow heel on the shoe allow for heel hooking even on tiny holds.    The most notable~ yet easily ignored feature are the Velcro straps. Not only do they help to quickly put them on and take them off~ they help maintain a snug fit even during a long route without having to worry about them loosening along the way.    Finally~ the leather/textile combination make them comfortable enough for long continuous use while still remaining durable and able to withstand continuous use in less than ideal conditions.
675,la-sportiva,miura-vs,5.0,   If I had to pick only one shoe for hard climbing~ this would be it.   Pros   This shoe does it all for face climbing/bouldering. Of course~ shoes fit feet differently~ depending on foot type. I have a wider~ high-volume foot~ and this shoes is excellent. The toe box is perfect for getting my weight on my big toe.   Size this one down~ and let it break in for a month. I've heard of too many people claiming they got them too tight.  If you give them time~ they will break in like a glove. I wear 11.5 street~ and I wear these in 41. I've also worn them in 40.5 with a much longer break-in time. 
676,la-sportiva,miura-vs,4.5,   Hi all. I have been using Miura VS (size 38.5) for about 4 months (near 3  trainings per week). Overall they are great~ but I become confused with  the next thing: my shoes are 1/2 inch smaller than the same Miuras  (37.5) of one guy. I tried his shoes and i should say~ that they are  more comfortable with the same performance. We have bought them in the  same shop~ and have been using them for nearly the same period of time.  So i have a question - is there a chance~ that my shoes will get  stretched 1/2 inch in the future? Thanks.
677,la-sportiva,miura-vs,5.0,   I bought these shoes extra small 42.5 when I usually wear a 44.   Edging and smearing is superb and give exceptional control on small holds. Works extremely well on small edges both in and outdoor. Heel hooks are very natural and when adjusted tight feel solid with no slippage. On overhangs it works particularly well.   Can be worn for about 1/2 hour before it will require loosening up to give feet a rest. The shoes will stretch minimally after a few weeks~ about 0.5 sizes at most. They will stain your feet as most La Sportiva's  with bright colors will do but that does not affect performance.   Overall an excellent high performance aggressive shoe with reasonable comfort when sized for high performance.
678,la-sportiva,miura-vs,4.5,   In short~ these are the best shoes I have ever owned. The edging is incredible and like all Sportiva shoes I love the rubber. Basically~ put your foot on the rock and as long as you trust your feet like you should~ they'll stick.    I have some what of a large~ but skinny foot. I normally wear a size 12- 12 1/2. I got these in a 44 and they have a little bit of excess material over the knuckles of my toes but strap them down tight and it does not seem to matter much. They stretch about a 1/2 size max in my experience~ so make sure to compensate if you need too.    Great shoes for sport climbing but if your into long trad climbs~ might want to go with something a little less aggressive because after awhile~ your foot gets a little sore.
679,la-sportiva,miura-vs,4.5,   La Sportiva has done it again. This shoe is ultra aggressive~ with a firm but comfortable fit. they make a huge difference when i climb tough routes~ i can stand on tiny jibs and i don't have to worry about slipping off. It has a really solid heel that i can depend on 100%. I can climb harder than ever before with these on. They are great for gyms and outdoor.   If your feet are still growing~ i would recommend getting a 1/2 a size larger than your normal climbing shoe size~ because these are pretty tight. they loosen up after a month of moderate use in a gym (once-twice a week). but they're still tight.   They keep their arches for a long time~ and you don't have to worry about replacing the rubber.   if i am climbing something really long (or climbing different routes for more than 2 hours)~ i have to take them off to let my feet stretch out.   Overall~ these are great shoes for someone who is ready to step up their level of performance. Dependable~ solid~ and aggressive.
680,la-sportiva,miura-vs,5.0,   I'm very critical of shoes~ but these are the best out. The edging is sweet and the heal is perfect. On every one of my hardest bouldering sends last fall~ I was working on them in my Anazasis~ then tried later after I got the Miuras~ and got the send. 
681,la-sportiva,testarossa,5.0,   Awesome rubber! I've used this shoes for 6 months and it seems new!    Pros   Awesome rubber! I've used this shoes for 6 months and it seems new! 
682,la-sportiva,testarossa,5.0,   I climbed in these shoes all last summer. I originally bought these as a second pair for more difficult climbing~ but they work so well I use them on all class 5 climbing~ despite how tight they fit. This is an excellent pro shoe. It hugs from heal to toe giving great feel for the rock. I have been able to toe and use my feet like never before. A must have for high class climbing!!!:) Important to give a half size stretch room~ It took about 3-6 months of climbing with really tight shoes but they have stretched a bit.
683,la-sportiva,testarossa,5.0,   I have used these shoes since their first year on the market and I have yet to find a shoe at the same level since the Dragons left the market. Right out of the box these shoes fit like a glove~ the heel is like another layer of skin. A perfect shoe for my foot.
684,la-sportiva,testarossa,5.0,   I've only owned these for a couple trips now but so far I love them. I upgraded from zens and the difference is phenomenal. I can smear like none other. I haven't used them on a roof yet and anticipate doing so soon but they grip so well I doubt they will have trouble.    They are very comfortable and in my opinion more comfortable than Anazazi's. The difference is night and day. Don't get this if you aren't serious about climbing~ it's truly an advanced climber's shoe. Would do well bouldering. Keep your less radical shoes for those longer trad and multipitch routes. But if you have the endurance you could do a four or five pitch route without much trouble. After that you'd be taking them off on belays.     By the way I have a wider foot but I think if you tightened the shoe it would work well for a narrow foor also. Look for them on sale.
685,la-sportiva,miura,4.0,   I'm a woman but have long~ narrow feet~ and find that the men's Miuras are great for me. The laces allow for me to cinch them up tightly enough for my narrow feet~ and they fit them like a glove.       I use these solely for gym climbing and they stick super well to plastic. They do take a while to break in and the toes are pretty pointy~ though~ so they get a little sore (but that's fine for gym~ cragging~ etc.).   Pros   Cons   Fit: Fits the foot itself like a glove~ but toes are a little cramped and can get sore/bruised.   Comfort: Takes a while to break in... probably about 10 climbs for me.   Traction: Sticks great to plastic — never tried on rock.   Construction: The shoe has held up really well over the last year and a half~ but the laces disintegrate pretty quickly with crack climbing (easy fix).   Conditions: Purchased around January 2013~ used a couple times a week in the gym since then.
686,la-sportiva,miura,5.0,   These shoes are just great for sport-climbing~ boulder and even trad climbing. I've used these guys overall and have no regrets. It's comfortable~ sticky and efficient.       Since a reliable edging on routes from a powerful heel job~ this shoes~ if fitted correctly~ can be your number one shoes. I'd recommend for every kind of climb. Seriously.   Pros   Cons   I felt that rubber stretched a lot~ so I'd recommend down sizing. How much? Depends on your style and your use. I wear a 9.5 street size and bought the Miuras on 39.5 (7 US) for precise use. It is still comfortable~ making me able to use at some routes (max. on 30' - 45'). When bouldering~ I use to take'em off.   The sole is a Vibram and super sticky. Try to maintain it clean and you won't regret. Idk about how much time it will last~ but for sure one year with intense use will be the minimum.    I've used on sandstone~ granite~ limestone and quartzito (at Brazil) and it last long very good. The Brazilian granite is so much more rough and they could still work good. Never had any contact with water or moisture~ and it didn't stink.   Conclusion: Great shoes. If you have the money~ it is worthwhile. You pay and will not bother yourself.
687,la-sportiva,miura,5.0,   Great climbing shoes for difficult routes. It is suitable for beginners also.   Pros   Cons   I use these climbing shoes for over two years now and I am very satisfied.    I use 1~5 size smaller than my actual size for shoes and are still quite comfortable (up to 20~ 25 min or so).   It gives user great and precise grip for small footholds~ allowing user to climb difficult routes.    Beside I just got a new rubber (worn out)~ shoes are still in good shape.    
688,la-sportiva,miura,5.0,   This shoe is perfect!! I was cautious about getting a velcro shoe~ but this holds just as tight as laces and is much easier to take off/on.   It took me from climbing a shaky 5.8 to a comfortable 5.9/10. I couldn't believe how much more confidence it gave my footing. It can smear and edge without any issues.   I use it indoor and outdoor. Mostly outdoor.   I have owned three different types of shoes and these are by far the best. Just buy these!!! You will be so glad you did.
689,la-sportiva,miura,4.0,   Pretty comfortable for an aggressive shoe. Great toeing & edging~ good for boulder problems~ overhangs~ toe-hooks.    Not impressed with the stickiness of the rubber; I've blown quite a few feet on technical slab problems. The back of the shoe can produce some pain on the achilles tendon. Mine lasted me a year and some change.    Overall~ I recommend them!
690,la-sportiva,miura,4.5,   I have been on the hunt for a shoe that fits my heel and so far the Miura is as close as it gets.    My first pair of climbing shoes was the Red Chili X Cube which had a heel that fitted me quite nicely but the shoe was 1-2 sizes too big. I later tried a Chilis again but super tight and due to the arch in your foot~ the heel wasn't as effective anymore.   The DENTEX material the Miuras are lined with are real rough on your toes especially if you fit them super tight and lead to calluses.   The vibram rubber is no way as sticky as stealth C4 or stealth Onyx but the Miuras have a stiff sole which gives you confidence on little edges.   I'm a street size 9US and my Miuras are 37 EUR.   The break-in period was painful and long. Took a solid 2 weeks with plastic freezer bags on before they didn't hurt as much but I still have to take them off between problems.   They are a great all rounder shoe.
691,la-sportiva,miura,5.0,   LaSportiva makes the highest quality of climbing shoes. The Miuras are no exception to this. This is my favorite shoe when I need surgical prescion for scary pull downs. It is extremely comfortable after break in. They will stretch 1/2 size~ buy them smaller to accommodate this. The edging of this shoe is unbeliaviable. Also the new XS grip rubber is the best all around rubber~ even better the stealth c4. I have never had problems with friction in this shoes. If they feet your feet proper~ and you want to take your climbing to the next level buy them.
692,la-sportiva,miura,5.0,   I've been climbing in Miuras for three years now. They are absolutely the best edgeing shoe I've found! As far as an all around~ there's nothing better that I've tried. Miuras are comfy~ clingy~ and an all around high performing shoe.
693,la-sportiva,miura,5.0,   They are a precise shoe~ which edge very well. They fit a narrow-medium width foot. The rubber is not as soft as C4. However~ I wear them on all routes unless the rock has poor friction or it is consistently steep. For lower friction rock and past vertical routes~ I prefer Scarpa slippers.  
694,la-sportiva,miura,3.0,   I haven't found them to be all that sticky. They do however edge superbly~ toe hook like my middle finger. And they are pretty comfy~ mine are breaking in after only a few climbs. They do stretch a half size to a size. Buy 'em good and snug and than buy them a half size smaller or you will be disappointed! Overall I am looking forward to working some more sport and trad routes in them.
695,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,5.0,   Since it's been a couple years between reviews I though I'd throw my opinion into the ring.   I agree with the other comments that this is a soft-shoe. Sized right there should be no concern regarding the heel slipping during heel hooks and whatnot~ and that you can expect some stretching. What I found in terms of this more than the length was the width~ which I was very glad for. Every foot's different I suppose.   What I think it's important to know about this shoe is that in addition to it being a great quiver shoe~ if you are starting out I feel that it's a great first shoe to purchase. Fit is essential~ but the sym's general-purpose performance carries into bouldering~ top rope~ even multi-pitch~ and the new climber's feet will not be killing them~ in turn they climb longer and more frequently.   I love these shoes and will probably always have a pair either on my feet or in the bag; provided Adidas doesn't ruin how Five Ten have been doing things.
696,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,4.0,   This has been my main climbing shoe for two years now. I have used it extensively in bouldering~ and sport routes in the gym and outside.     Pros   Cons   The leather and elastic perfectly formed to my feet and I never felt the shoes come off if I rarely did any heel-hooking. From plenty of climbing~ the first part of the shoe was the tip and the leather is soft so I can feel the holds under the rubber which boosted my confidence on small holds. 
697,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,4.0,   I've been using this shoe as my lap running shoe/comfort shoe in the gym and its been working pretty well. This is a very sensitive soft soled shoe so know that if your feet are not strong(aka a beginner) you will feel small sharp jibs through the shoe.   I bought the shoe about 1 1/2- 2 sizes down which I think is going to be about right. This shoe will stretch a lot but that break in period is a pain. Once you get through the break in period though it really is a very comfortable shoe.   Cant say much more then everyone else on all the other review sites have said so I'll cliff note my review   -very sensitive shoe      -stretches a lot keep that in mind when you buy id say down size 2 sizes for boulders 1-1 1/2 for comfort      -will dye your feet red first few times      -can and has been used to climb everything from 5.14c to v14 boulder problems      -very versatile shoe I suggest everyone have a pair of slippers in there shoe arsenal      -if you have a high volume foot the shoe can feel a little shallow
698,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,4.0,   The Five Ten Anasazi Mocs were the first bouldering shoes I had. They are not easy for a beginner~ but I learned to love them. I bought them because they were all that was in stock at my rock gym and I wanted them fast.     At first I felt stupid for buying them~ they were horrifically uncomfy. But trust me~ after 2 weeks of hard climbing~ they totally conformed to my foot. Now i love these shoes.    I wear a size 11 street and size 9.5 rock shoe.   Other than the fact they turn your feet red from the dye in the leather~ I love them.
699,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,5.0,   Great all around shoe. Super comfortable for many uses from bouldering to sport to multipitch. Suede upper fit like a glove after two weeks and it still does one year later. Heel fit is especailly nice b/c the rubber wrap doesn't open up around the heel like some other shoes (like when the suede streches out and is baggy around the heel on some shoes). Its preformance has been great without being a super aggressive shoe.
700,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,4.0,   These are the first pair of shoes that I owned. As said in the other reviews~ they are not the best for edging~ but smearing they work great. They are also super comfortable~ at least when it comes to climbing for long periods and comparitively to other shoes.
701,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,4.0,"   Like the other post by Grant~ they are not the perfect edging shoe. If you have strong toes~ then they'll be fine~ but not much support. Great for the gym and fine outside~ just remember if your feet sweat these shoes will stretch a good amount (one full size?). I didn't buy mine small enough. I was climbing ""Party in your mind"" at the New (about 100 foot climb) and about halfway through they started to stretch to the point where my big toe would slide in the shoe. Pobably wouldn't have happened if I bought a size or half size smaller. Overall great shoe and could be like Grant said~ the good ol' standby."
702,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,4.0,"   A beautiful standby. Comfortable. Although their personality changes after they break in. When you buy them they are really good edging shoes~ but after about two weeks of solid climbing they slowly retire into smearing beauties. Buy them though. They are a really good shoe to have. If you only climb in a gym~ which most ""climbers"" do these days~ these are the only shoes you need.   P.S. If you are a climber living in southern california/orange county area you should email me to go do some bouldering. "
703,five-ten,anasazi-moccasym,5.0,"   What can I say--they are THE BEST SHOES YOU""LL EVER OWN--period! The stealth rubber is the stickiest I've ever used~ in fact it could be considered cheating to use these shoes~ I love 'em. Get them a tad small~ but not too tight cos they're lined and don't stretch too much~ but they do conform to your foot shape. Other great thing about them is you can throw them into the washing machine as they're not made of leather at all (which should please other vegans out there too! ). DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ANY OTHER SHOE--IN THE END YOU'LL GET THE ANASAZIS ANYWAY!!!:)"
704,la-sportiva,otaki,5.0,   The La Sportiva Otakis climbed very well on the sandstone of Castle Rock and on the volcanic conglomerate of Pinnacles. They work well for experienced rock climbers. While I did not get a chance to climb on quartzite or limestone during the review period~ the bit of foot-scuffing I did on our home quartzite front entry indicated that the Otakis will also work well on quartzite.       As with all technical rock shoes~ you should get them fitted by a boot and shoe fitter who is well trained in the peculiarities of high tech rock shoes.   Pros   Cons   Background   At the top of the list of gear for anyone climbing on technical routes is what you wear on your feet. In my many decades of outdoor activities~ I have had footwear that ranged from miserable to wonderful. I have climbed technical rock in everything from mountaineering boots to running shoes to PAs and EBs to purpose-made rock shoes~ and modern approach shoes that make provision for edging and smearing (see my review of La Sportiva’s TX4 approach shoe). Much of that footwear~ like these specialized Otaki rock shoes~ has been single purpose~ designed for a very narrow range of activities.   Most specialized shoes for technical rock climbing are very uncomfortable to wear on a long approach trail. So now we wear shoes designed for approach to the climb~ carrying the technical shoes which we change into at the start of the technical part of the climb~ then carrying the approach shoes on a carabiner along with the other technical gear. When doing extended multi-pitch climbs~ we loosen the straps or shoestrings at belay stances~ or even take the shoes off to rest our cramped feet.   Although modern approach shoes have seen some significant improvements~ enabling their use on moderately technical climbs~ the higher grades and certain types of rock formations call for shoes with a significant down-turn in the sole and provisions for heel-hooking.     I have certain expectations for any gear I am going to use. For technical rock shoes~ I expect the following:   First Impressions   Trailspace had arranged for a pair of La Sportiva’s new Otaki shoes~ Euro size 42 (US size 9). Although the box did not appear on my doorstep for several months~ when the box appeared~ I opened it to find the “Blue and Flame” colored shoes (that is what the description in the box says the color is).   The design of the shoe is a new development in the La Sportiva line of technical shoes. My first impression on opening the box was that the Otakis are a lot like ballet toe shoes — something my sister complained about a lot when taking the ballet lessons that every little girl took while she was growing up (in those days boys didn’t do sissy things like ballet — or was it that we weren’t capable of enduring the pain). They are light~ as expected for technical shoes (1p 5.5 oz/612 gm)   According to La Sportiva’s web site:   “Otaki in Japanese Samurai slang is the oldest single wire sword: extremely sharp and precise also on small targets. A concept perfectly applicable to climbing: Otaki is a precise~ supportive and structured climbing shoe~ ideal for climbing in crags~ on walls and boulders thanks to features that meet the requirements of today’s modern climbers.”   A Samurai sword on my feet??? Hmmm …. Does this forbode pain???   I had not used the high-tech shoes with the drastic down-turn shape before the Otakis. Based on comments from many friends and acquaintances who have used this type of shoe~ I was dreading the extreme tightness and forced bending of the foot they described. I put on a pair of Injinji toe socks~ then inserted my feet into the shoes and tightened the two velcro straps across the top of the foot (unlike many rock climbers~ I find that a pair of liner socks is far more comfortable than going barefoot for my rock shoes).   As expected~ they were very close-fitting~ though the downturn was not as re-forming of my foot as I had feared (my Evolv and 5-10 rock shoes have fairly flat~ stiff soles for edging). I will have to say~ though~ that the color scheme does not thrill me. But then~ the last couple of trail running shoes I have bought now are offered only in colors that also do not thrill me.   The shoe bottom of “sticky rubber” is made by Vibram (as are the soles of most of the hiking and climbing shoes and boots I own these days). I have not used the shoes enough to determine the wear rate~ although I have ascended several hundred feet of various rock types in climbing areas (mostly sandstone in the Santa Cruz Mountains and volcanic conglomerate~ both in hot dry weather and in cold rainy weather).   Recently~ a climbing partner who does much more technical climbs than I do at this stage~ told me a way to keep the sticky rubber stickier after a lot of climbing smooths the soles~ and that is to use a wire brush to refresh the grip of the sticky rubber (there is a technique to using the brush so you do not reduce the lifespan).   This image is a side view of the Otakis on the quartzite entry to our house. During the testing~ I did not get a chance to try the Otakis on quartzite~ though I did use them on sandstone and volcanic conglomerate. I did some scuffing on the quartzite to get an idea of how well it would grip on that rock.The image is the Otakis with my feet in them and standing on the quartzite entry to our house.   The pointy toes and significant downturn of the soles had me a bit worried   Despite my worries~ the “last” that La Sportiva uses (PD 75) is close enough to my foot for comfort (the “last” is the foot-shaped block that a boot or shoe is designed and built around by the manufacturer for each size). I should not have been so worried~ since I have found over the years that La Sportiva’s climbing boots~ approach shoes~ and ski boots fit my feet very well. Everyone’s feet are different~ of course. So just because they fit me well does not mean they fit other people well. Another manufacturer that fits me well is Scarpa~ another Italian brand.   I did a bit of walking around the house and yard before heading for the rocks. I did find that~ while the Otakis work well on the rock~ they are very tight for walking for any distance. So while I wore the Otakis almost exclusively when climbing on technical routes~ I used approach shoes to get to the base of the rocks~ plus loosening the Velcro straps when belaying my partner at stances~.   Details of Testing   My intention was to quickly do a few climbs at a couple of local climbing areas. Here in California~ we are blessed with a wide variety of rock types within a short distance. As it turned out~ a large number of tasks were waiting for my attention~ including several distant trips and teaching a couple of climbing instructor courses (you don’t get to climb much yourself when training other people to become instructors)~ along with a series of El Niño storms.   Despite those demands~ I managed to do a bit of bouldering and climbing on both sandstone at Castle Rock State Park and on volcanic conglomerate at Pinnacles National Park (both~ well-known for producing a number of famous climbers).   Castle Rock is very close to being on the San Andreas Rift. The rock there is coastal sandstone. This means that during dry spells~ some sections of rock are well cemented~ while others are very friable~ and brushing the surface with your hand or shoe scrapes off sand particles. The climbing is mostly bouldering~ and in most of the park is very enjoyable. Since coastal sandstone is even more friable when wet~ El Niño precluded several weekends.   Pinnacles National Park sits directly on the San Andreas Fault Rift. The rock is a volcanic conglomerate with pieces of a wide variety of minerals embedded in the solidified magma. Some of the minerals are in the form of large crystals that would provide large steps~ if the crystals were not highly polished slopers and did not from time to time simply lift out in your hand~ plus being located in widely spaced random patterns. In some places the climbing requires long reaches and/or big steps if you stick to the large holds. The surface between the larger inclusions works well for smearing and the smaller inclusions provide plenty of crimps .   I did get to try the Otakis in connection with the Climbing Instructor course I taught during the latter half of 2016. The indoor session was at the very nice climbing wall at the headquarters of the San Francisco Bay Area Boy Scout Council. I have been told that the “Rock”~ as it is named~ was made from a casting of a real bouldering rock. There are a number of routes that are molded into The Rock~ featuring natural holds~ an overhang that is passed via a jam crack or heel hook~ and a chimney.   The surface of The Rock is similar to sandstone~ allowing me to test the grip of the shoes. In addition~ there is the usual plethora of artificial holds bolted all over The Rock. I have used this for over 15 years in training instructors and in helping troops hold introductory climbing sessions~ some of which were of Boy Scout units of underprivileged youth.   Usually~ during the courses~ as Climbing Director~ I get little to no climbing in myself. Since the class was small~ and I had only one assistant~ I had to do some of the demonstrations of edging~ smearing~ mantling~ and other techniques myself. Below are several images of me trying out the Otakis on both natural holds and artificial bolt-on holds.     The Rock at San Francisco Bay Area Council officeBypassing the overhang next to the chimney   The next session was at Castle Rock. However~ because of a series of rainstorms~ we had to delay the session there. When we finally got a four-day break to get the rock completely dried~ we had the Castle Rock session for the student instructors. The following photo shows the shoes on one of the sloping surfaces to give an idea of the grippiness of the shoes. I was well pleased with the performance both on the volcanic conglomerate and on the sandstone at Castle Rock.      The rest of the photos were taken at Pinnacles National Park.      The video in Pinnacles NP~ is on a formation named the Sisters~ in particular on First Sister. Many of the routes in Pinnacles are run-out~ as you might note in the video where I clipped the first bolt. My high point in the video is at the first chain~ from which I rappelled.      Conclusions   The La Sportiva Otaki shoe met all my listed expectations for a rock shoe. So I gave the shoe a full 5-star rating. However~ I will remind readers that everyone’s feet differ~ especially when it comes to rock shoes.   In summary~ the Otaki climbed very well on the sandstone of Castle Rock and on the volcanic conglomerate of Pinnacles. While I did not get a chance to climb on quartzite or limestone during the review period~ the bit of foot-scuffing I did on our home quartzite front entry indicated that the grip on quartzite will work well with the Otakis..
705,la-sportiva,otaki,5.0,   Great overall shoe for sport climbing. Nice sticky rubber really helps on slab.   Pros   Cons   Shoe fits well. Definitely one of the wider Sportivas. I would recommend if you have a wider foot. Breaks in very nicely and very quickly. It does not stretch much but it molds to your foot.  Super comfortable from the get-go and I can wear them for two-three routes before I have to take them off even when I first got them.   Great sticky rubber makes it excellent for slab work and a stiff edge makes it great for the razor blade edges. Strong heel makes it great for hooks and the stiff toe really helps it dig into pockets.   Might not be the best for sloped ledges (it slips a bit on these for some reason) though that might be personal technique.    Rubber looks like it can hold up to quite a bit of abuse. Taken it outdoors a few times and they are holding up okay so far. I also use them at the gym.   Great overall shoe that excels at sport (in my experience). It's great at feeling out edges and sticking to them. Definitely recommend this shoe if you are looking for something more aggressive~ but not insanely so. 
706,five-ten,siren,4.5,   Rad low-volume shoe!   Pros   Cons   I'm on my second pair of Sirens. As with all aspiring climbers~ your first pair is never tight enough~ and these stretched so that my laces were maxed out in tightness. I dropped a whole size~ and have been pleased ever since.   The heel is tight enough that I can't possibly slip out when heel hooking~ but doesn't press on my achilles tendon~ like a lot of other shoes do. It could use thicker rubber~ though — I HURT when I'm really putting my weight on that heel. They also don't seem to develop that crease at the rubber/leather boundary at the toe~ so the top of my toes don't get rubbed raw.   They've held up well to heavy gym climbing (3-4x/week)~ and light outdoor bouldering (2x/ summer month). While tight~ they are much more comfortable than my other shoes~ since they aren't terribly aggressive. Another plus is that the dye doesn't bleed onto your feet~ like some other shoes do.
707,five-ten,siren,5.0,   This shoe is awesome! I have a really narrow foot and it's hard to find any shoe that will fit my foot. As soon as I tried these on in the store I knew I couldn't leave without them. These seem to be a really good all around shoe but so far I've only taken them to the gym to boulder and climb routs. I'm rating this shoe 5 stars mostly because I'm impressed with how comfortable the shoe is and it seems to excel in what fiveten says it should. This shoe is awesome and I really hope it lasts outside!
708,la-sportiva,solution,5.0,   The name is not meant in jest~ these are by far the best performance shoe I've come across. I tried Katanas and found there was far too much space in the heel — not so with Solutions. I went down 3 shoes sizes~ still snug and not too painful! The strap is great and the smell is not too funky.      Pros   Cons   The name is not meant in jest~ these are by far the best performance shoe I've come across.   I tried Katanas a while ago and found there was far too much space in the heel - not so with Solutions. I went down 3 shoes sizes~ still snug and not too painful!   The strap is great and with the two finger loops — these are very easy to get on and off.   After a whole day at the crag~ you may cramp a bit — just try to remember to slide them off for a break every now and then.
709,la-sportiva,solution,5.0,   This is an overall amazing shoe. For everyone who complains about them wearing out~ that's your fault for wearing them in training. Use a cheaper shoe for training (I use the Red Chili Corona)~ it saves your best shoes for comps.
710,la-sportiva,solution,4.5,   The rubber is very sticky and as long as you care for the shoes it remains so. If you have good footwork then they will not wear out quickly. The fit is like a glove because of the elastic material that on the inside of the shoe.     I get shoes cheap because of my pro deal so I have tried many of the brands out there. For my foot the Solutions come in close second to the Jet7. When you size these shoes it should be a fight to get them on and they should be uncomfortable~ they are one of the most aggressive shoes on the market. For long rope climbs I suggest the Cobra or Miura over these.
711,la-sportiva,solution,4.0,   Gone through two pairs of this shoe in 7 months climbing 3-4 times a week at local gym. Took 3 sizes down from shoe size and still moderately comfortable. Feels incredibly powerful on roof problems and edging~ some difficulty with smearing compared with a less technical shoe. Supportive on the arches of my feet like no other shoe I have tried.     Only concern is the rate at which the material deteriorates. The metal strap holes rust very quickly and cut away at the straps~ all my straps snapped after around 3 1/2 months use and the material in the heel wears away and leaves your heel exposed to blisters from the less comfortable material. In about the same time as it takes for the rubber to wear at the toe. So there is no point getting the rubber recapped.   If you can afford to replace every 3 months then this is the shoe for you. Otherwise get something more hard wearing that can take a resoling and still survive a for another 3 months.
712,five-ten,anasazi-lace,5.0,   I have the old pink version.   Extremely precise shoe with very sticky rubber. Excels on very small footholds but not only.   They are not comfortable~ so shouldn't be normally used in multi-pitch routes. I have 1/2 size down compared to street size.   I find these shoes superior to other models I tried. So I imagine the current Anasazi Blanco is only better than the pink one. Maybe improved on the comfort side also.
713,five-ten,anasazi-lace,5.0,   This shoe is the ferrari of 5.10. Along with the Anasazi velcro version~ these two shoes dominate in terms of precision. I prefer the lace-up as it stays on my foot better when heel hooking. The lined leather insures minimum stretch~ and the toebox is very aggressive~ though not downturned. Combined with stealth rubber~ these shoes are about as high performance as shoes get.    Size down 1/2 - 1 full size for a tight~ bouldery fit. I have used two pairs so far~ the same size as my street shoe (10.5) and find them very precise~ yet comfortable enough for a few pitches in a row or a lengthy bouldering session. They are excellent in cracks as well~ but not if your toes are curled and squished! Entirely worth the price.
714,five-ten,anasazi-lace,4.0,   This is an excellent shoe~ but is not suggested for beginners. I have had this shoe a bit now and know~ and know: they hurt. I wear a size 10.5 street shoe~ and I have these in 9.5~ so that of course factors in~ but regardless... The shoe is very good for heel hooking~ smearing~ anything you could imagine~ but by the end of the climb you will be desperately trying to unlace them. If you simply unlace them~ with half of your foot in~ it is still a very good shoe~ and equivalent to a beginner's shoe perhaps.   Overall~ the shoe is a very good one; however~ the downside is the pain.
715,scarpa,origin,5.0,   Fantastic beginner shoe for anyone looking to get started.      Fit tapers a little from a slightly narrowed heel to a medium-wide toebox.   Pros   Cons   These were my first pair of shoes I bought. I normally wear 12-12.5 and got a size 46~ I found this too tight so I also got a pair size 47 and used those until my feet got conditioned and then I went back to size 46.   What can I say about this shoe? They've stuck with me since the beginning and I've gone from climbing 5.9 to 5.11 in about nine months. They're good at pretty much everything up until 5.11s I would say.   Now~ all that said~ that's in comparison to more expensive shoes. These have the best fit~ stick~ and precision of all the beginner shoes I've tried (Sportiva Tarantulace and a few different styles of rental shoes)~ in addition to being super durable so they'll last long enough for you to learn the basics and then some.   Overall I would recommend these to any beginner (provided the shoe fits well)~ or anyone looking for a comfortable and easy to use gym shoe. If you want more performance but don't want to sacrifice comfort~ I would highly suggest taking a look at Scarpa's Force V shoes.   I also love these for climbing outdoors as they're comfortable enough when I'm stuck standing on a move for what feels like infinity² that I don't feel like my toes are going to be sausages at the end of the day~ and they do well enough on slab.
716,scarpa,origin,4.0,   This is an excellent introductory climbing shoe. They blend comfort with technical power and durability quite well for a beginner shoe.    Pros   Cons   I climbed in them for two years~ about once a week~ and they held up well. They are comfortable~ but still allow you to climb moderate difficulty. Excellent edge and moderate curve. The fit was excellent~ with the leather upper shoe stretching slightly to match my foot. 
717,scarpa,force-x,5.0,"   This shoe is the most comfortable shoe that I've tried on and/or used. I got it for an inexpensive price and it fits like a glove without being painful. Sticky and light. I couldn't be happier.   Pros   Cons   I am a beginner climber and had a hard time finding a comfortable shoe. The ""experts"" at the climbing stores kept telling me that the shoes had to be tight and uncomfortable because your feet had to feel the edges~ nooks~ and crannies of the climbing wall and needed to be responsive. Trying on shoes and having my toes knuckle under was a good way to dissuade me from continuing in the sport.   Finally~ at one of the small outdoor gear stores here locally~ the salesman~ who was a climber~ told me that the concept of tight fitting was old and that for a beginner comfort was paramount. He recommended the Scarpa Force X~ telling me that although it wouldn't be as responsive as some more ""aggressive"" shoes~ that as a beginner that it didn't matter because I wouldn't be doing any technical climbing where sensitivity was needed. He also indicated that the shoe would serve me well because I could use it as an intermediate shoe when I advanced in skills.   So I tried it on and was more than just pleasantly surprised. I was impressed. It was comfortable and it was on sale for 50% off. So I took the chance~ bought it~ and it has been terrific. Comfortable and padded in the heel.  I don't know about technical climbing~ but I do know the shoe has performed great and still remains comfortable.   Many of the more skilled climbers that I go out with will take a breather and remove their shoes to get a break from the discomfort. Not me. I just keep on going. Many have asked me what the heck is wrong with me and I tell them that the Force X fits great and my feet don't get tired from the fit. In fact~ a couple of my fellow climbers have gone out and purchased them and thanked me for the recommendation.   I know that they aren't sensitive and that the heel padding isn't good for heel locking. But I'm not at that level yet. They aren't as sensitive for feel and you have to be aware of that for the pockets~ crags~ edging~ and cracks.  But I think it improves my skill because I have to concentrate on my technique and they have made me a better climber."
718,scarpa,force-x,4.0,   Great entry level to intermediate shoe~ as well as a wonderful all-day multi-pitch choice for the more experienced climbers. Very comfortable out of the box~ ample padding and support~ flat last provides all day comfort~ Velcro makes entry and exit a snap~ perforated tongue breathes well and the movement from the previous lorica upper to suede assures a glove like fit. Vibram xs Edge Rubber edges well~ while allowing you to smear on shallow scoops and depressions. A well built product that will provide you will several seasons of comfort. I would recommend this shoe to anyone that values comfort~ good performance and quality.   Pros   Cons   So I pulled my Force x's out of the box yesterday...literally 30 minutes before heading out to the local crag~ shoved my feet in them~ cinched them up and climbed!   First impressions are these:     This is an extremely well built shoe. Totally lined throughout...including the heel cup and around the ankle. A generously padded perforated tongue keeps the top of the foot protected and comfortable~ velcro (hook and loop) system (opposing straps) is easy on easy off on those hot days.    I am not a fan of the xs edge rubber~ but even on the steep slab that I tested them on yesterday~ they seemed to hold quite well on small depressions~ nubbins and thin cracks. They smeared quite a bit better than I expected...a happy bonus for sure. They also held an edge quite nicely~ again...much better than anticipated.    I got these shoes for all day guiding and long routes...I needed something comfortable but not so big and sloppy that they were useless to climb in. I have found that these shoes do a nice job bridging the gap and are extremely comfortable right out of the box.    I did size these shoes up considerably from my Instincts. The Instincts are a 44.5 and I went up a full size to a 45.5 and am psyched. I probably could have gotten away with a 45~ but at close to 50 years old...why? lol. My dogs have suffered enough...(think 80's). Toe rand is good and has nice coverage.    These are not a real technical shoe by any stretch and probably not a great choice for steep overhanging sport or bouldering~ and they were a bit painful in the cracks (more like a slipper or even an Anasazi/Galileo). Despite the flat last and stiffer rubber the forefoot was pinched in the fist to hand jamb wide cracks. Still~ they do provide good torsional support which allows you to edge for hours without foot fatigue or pain.   So...first impressions are very good. I put 6 pitches under these puppies..starting at 5.8+ and moving up to  to 5.10 and never once reached for the velcro tabs or ibuprofin!! These would be a great beginner to intermediate shoe~ but you guys in the higher number range may want to consider this shoe for those moderate all day outings and long routes (I am thinking Winds~ etc...).   Ultimately~ these are a wonderful intermediate~ jack of all trades~ climbing shoe made with quality materials and a great deal of thought in the design. If you are in the market for a comfortable~ all day shoe for those long trad routes~ single pitch moderates or padding around on the slabs~ these should be at the top of your list!
719,la-sportiva,oxygym,5.0,   This is an excellent versatile climbing shoe for a beginner. Comfortable and as good outside the gym as it is in the gym. Excellent fit.   Pros   I tried on various hiking shoes that were beginner shoes and they were all extremely uncomfortable. All the salespeople were telling me that the shoe had to fit small or tight in order to climb properly and that the shoes would break in and stretch and eventually stretch and fit my foot like a glove. I thought that was nonsense.   Finally a salesperson told me that the belief that smaller was better was now fiction especially since I was a beginner and not going to be doing overhangs or technical climbing. So he recommended several shoes including the Oxygyms for me to try on. All of the shoes were comfortable but the Oxygym felt the best for my feet. I knew they were supposedly gym shoes but the salesperson told me they could easily be used outdoors without any problem.   I am so glad I bought a pair. They are comfortable to the point that I can wear them all day without having to remove them for a break for my feet. I bought a pair true to size and have had no problem with slippage or stretching since they are synthetic. Good rubber for smearing. A big bonus is that they are washable to get rid of the stench from multiple uses.   I have used them for crack climbing in the gym and while not designed for that purpose~ they have held up reasonably well to the challenge.
720,scarpa,vapor,5.0,   I have a wider women's foot~ this shoe fits my forefoot like a second skin. The edging is tremendous in the steeps. Due to the downturned sole~ smearing is not as effective on friction. They aren't an all day wear~ but after the break from belaying~ I can put them on again without concern. The heel cup fits snugly. I wear the same as my street shoe.    Pros   Cons   I have a wider women's foot and this shoe fits my forefoot like a second skin. Not without a lengthy break-in period. It requires wearing them for a pitch~ then taking them off for belay~ then wearing again. They're now my favorites.   They aren't an all day wear~ but they are great when the conditions are right. Due to the downturned sole~ smearing is not effective on friction. The edging is tremendous in the steeps. The heel cup fits snugly and the lacing allows a custom fit. I wear the same as my street shoe.   It's a great shoe; I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little wider women's shoe than most that is available.
721,tenaya,oasi,5.0,   The Oasis are a versatile slipper that can handle pretty much anything you can throw at it. I have been heavily using my pair for a few months now~ and so far nothing about them has disappointed me.       I've spent long days bouldering (outdoors and in) with them~ used them on slabby and steep sport climbs~ and even spent some time in them on longer trad routes. They have shone in all scenarios.   Pros   Cons   FIT.    These fit me perfectly~ but make sure when sizing for yourself you get a size down. Once you dial in the size~ they are incredibly glovelike. Unlike other downturned shoes I have tried~ these are very ergonomic.   I have a fairly wide forefoot~ and a regular heel. The Oasis have a funny looking swedge on the outside part of the heel that actually does an excellent job of grabbing your foot and still providing room.   COMFORT.   Absurdly comfortable. You have to consider how incredibly technical these are~ and even despite a fairly aggressive downturn~ they manage to achieve an all-day-wear feel. A break-in period was pretty much nonexistent~ as I went climbing for a long session in Tahoe the day I got them.   Most climbing shoes I have owned let in tons of debris in any situation~ but I put these through the wringer running between boulders in a pine forest~ and got next to nothing inside the shoes. They have a mesh sock/liner that extends up a bit past the leather and rubber portions~ and acts as a perfect barrier.   TRACTION.   Friction that rivals 5.10s~ but also performs on absurdly hot slab. Nothing more to say on that.   TEMPERATURE CONTROL.   I find myself to be a moderately sweaty person~ but even indoors in crazy heat these haven't felt slick or wet inside. The leather is a lifesaver~ and the mech spots are well placed. I have not felt any hotspots with these~ and as I said earlier~ I've worn them for long strenuous sessions.   EASE OF USE.   Yes. The strap system is the best I've ever used~ and it seems like you could effectively climb in them without the straps at all. They are incredibly adjustable~ and quick to get on/off.   FEATURES.   They are not overplayed~ and every claim I have seen about them has turned out to be true. You will definitely feel more confident and precise in your footwork~ and your climbing should see an improvement as a result.   Before these~ I had a pair of Evolv Nexxos that I spent nearly 4 months trying to break in. They basically serve the same purpose~ but the Oasis are far more capable in a range of uses. There is no way I could wear the Nexxos longer than 15 minutes~ let alone on a multipitch climb. I now plan to sell the Nexxos~ and basically just use the Oasis for everything.    DURABILITY.   I have only had my pair of Oasis for two months~ but they've been through a lot in that time. In addition to daily climbing and bouldering~ I've used them for scrambling on Sierra granite~ and they show no wear at all. To my continuing surprise~ that is not an exaggeration; whenever I wipe them clean~ the rubber looks factory fresh. The only part of the shoe that is showing wear are the spots with white leather~ and that is only some dirt staining.   I've used them in many different situations~ but have not yet had the chance to climb any vertical cracks in them. I expect them to be capable in that situation~ but maybe not as ideal as something more specialized.   All in all~ if you like shoes that provide ground/rock feel and are adaptable to nearly every situation~ these are for you. Just make sure you find them on sale.
722,la-sportiva,mythos,5.0,"   Great comfort~ perfect multi-pitch and all around shoe—very durable.   Pros   Cons   I had my Mythos for three years and have climbed with it on rock—usually sport climbing~ vertical walls~ slabs~ chimneys~ and multi-pitch. I have found it really comfortable (for me a big plus~ as I cannot endure pain in my feet for climbing. I simply cannot stand shoes that cause me pain in the foot/toes)~ and it does not have any of the new ""plastic in the sole"" P3 technology that La Sportiva does now (which makes your foot not feel the rock at all—I do not like that).   So it is kind of a traditional ""soft"" shoe~ still holding the ankles~ the sole is flat~ not like new aggressive shoes~ but your foot learns the rock that way and your foot arch gets stronger too (compared to the artificial plastic hard lining. I have a pair of Katanas and I cannot use them because of not feeling the rock and pain). I do yoga~ so also a reason why my feet are strong and prefer softer shoes.   I actually can climb 7a-c little edges with these and smear against the rock. The rubber is great. Even though they aren't really for edging~ and with time the original edge has worn off~ but I can still use them for it! I bet your foot learns to work better in such a shoe.   These are my second shoes and they're still in perfect condition after 3 (no need for resoling~ no holes in the rubber yet)~ but i use them in alternance with a boreal. I am really amazed by how well you can climb with these shoes~ how your foot learns the rock~ and you can smear it into little edges.   Regarding size~ my feet are size 39 and the shoes are 37 (in Katana laces~ I bought 38~5).   Sure~ I am thinking of getting a more precise shoe (but not Katanas~ maybe Cobras?) something that's comfy~ holds the ankle well~ all around~ but gives a little more precision on the front for small edges.    All in all~ my favourite shoe~ I really recommend it to those who seek comfort~ traditional old school shoes. I actually have a great climber friend—he's 60~ has put up loads of 7-8c routes in these exact shoes in the late '70s and '80s and he is still using Mythos to climb :) - I was proud to see that we are using the same shoe.    "
723,la-sportiva,mythos,4.5,   Used them since 1997. Comfortable — excellent fit to feet~ can wear all day eg on 400m routes. Can be resoled~ just make sure you don't wear the nose too much and get the 4mm resole.   Pros   Cons   All round fit brilliant. Moulds even to very wide feet. Grip quite OK by me up to grade 22.   Surprisingly good as a crack shoe though larger sizes help. I do have a few sizes though for my size 11 1/2 J feet
724,la-sportiva,mythos,5.0,   I absolutely love these climbing shoes! My biggest surprise with these shoes was how well I was able to smear on the wall with them. I have had difficulty finding a shoe that is better than these.    Pros   I definitely recommend this shoe. It fits perfectly and just molds to your foot. It is very comfortable and doesn't take too long to break in. I can wear these shoes all day if I wanted to and they don't pinch my toes as bad as some shoes do.   Although~ I would love to find a climbing shoe that will give my ankle some support~ these are very nice~ and I never hurt my ankle in them.
725,la-sportiva,mythos,4.0,   I have had these shoes for two years~ and they are pretty good shoes. I was hoping for them to be a little more sticky.   Pros:   Fit is like a glove~ they form to your feet nicely.    Cons:   Not very sticky~ especially on cold days.
726,la-sportiva,mythos,5.0,   I have been climbing for three years and I split my time between trad~ sport~ and bouldering. I bought the Mythos a year ago before a trip out to Indian Creek for the splitter cracks. I sized them a touch big for long days of jamming. Since then these have become my main shoes indoors and out~ performing on vertical to slab to gym bouldering. I have found the rubber to be as sticky as any other La Sportiva shoe and they do smear very well. The lacing allows for great adjustability to ones foot.   A note on sizing: these shoes depending on how you size them can do any type of climbing except steep stuff and micro cracks. Size them small and tight and they are great for edging~ vertical~ and slab. If you size them a touch large they are great all day trad and crack climbing shoes. So it all depends on how you size them.
727,la-sportiva,mythos,3.0,   Comfortable shoe~ very comfortable~ nice for cracks~ multi pitches or long climbs~ but not very sticky~ and not so great for face sport climbs.
728,la-sportiva,mythos,3.0,   I've gone through four pairs of Mythos~ some with 1-2 resoles (with Stealth rubber -- BIG improvement!). They're a good all-day shoe~ great for cracks and decent edging too. Definitely NOT an aggressive sport or bouldering shoe however. The rubber tends to wear out quickly in the front of the toe in particular~ and even new isn't really that sticky. In fact~ the rubber can get very hard and slippery after a while~ worse than most shoes.    They stretch a LOT. My foot is size 9~ my first Mythos were size 8 and they were quickly unusably large. I went to 6.5 which were tight and stretched to be comfortable even for long pitches or sessions. When I got my third pair I got the smallest shoe that I could physically cram my foot into~ size 5~ although initially the pain was too much to even stand on. Nonetheless they ultimately stretched to remain snug even in their old age and they are the ones I still use from time to time.    Moral: get them 2-4 full sizes small. This is not a performance shoe and the rubber is sub-par. But they are well made~ they resole well~ they are comfortable~ and are still my favorites for long days of easy to moderate climbing. But if you're going to push yourself hard~ get a better shoe.
729,la-sportiva,mythos,5.0,   Ahh the Mythos. Perhaps my favorite climbing shoe of all time. By far the most comfortable shoe on the market. If you size it small enough~ it is one of the best performing too.  These are always in my pack for bouldering~ slabs~ cracks~ and moderate face climbs. The sensitivity of these shoes are phenomenal. Also the new XS grip is the best rubber on the market~ I prefer it over stealth c4 because it lasts longer and is stickier. The leather on these is the softest in the climbing shoe world~ giving them the best comfort and break in capabilites.  The soft leather streaches to your foot. It does stretch about a size~ so buy these mothers tight! 
730,la-sportiva,mythos,4.0,   Great for practicing footwork~ felt the best when comparing shoes. I felt like I could really grow into it--my foot's second layer for climbing.  Laces get in the way~ but I double-tie them with no problem~ and for some reason still prefer laces over velcro.
731,la-sportiva,mythos,4.0,   It is a great shoe when you are improving your skills in footwork. I have had them for about two years~ they rock. There are some drawbacks that I have had. When my foot started to sweat heal hocking is out of the question~ my heal slides out. Overall it kicks a**.
732,mad-rock,flash,4.0,   A cheap comfy shoe with a good heel. Not the greatest edging~ but for the price very good value.       Pros   Cons   A cheap comfortable shoe which is very versatile~ good for bouldering~ overhanging sport routes~ multi pitch climbing (if you go up half a size).    Sport climbing it is good for me up to 7C on overhanging and 7A faces.   No problem bouldering up to V5-6.   It does wear out pretty fast~ but for the price it's great. 
733,mad-rock,flash,4.0,   Comfotable shoe~ great design~ and looks cool on my feet.   Pros   Cons   All around awesome fit. I usually wear a 9.5 shoe but decided to go one size smaller. Am wearing the 9.0 size and was the best decision I made when purchasing this shoe.   A bit of break-in time is needed but that goes with any other climbing shoe. One of my cons was the fact that the dye on the inside of the shoe turns my heel and pads of my feet orange   As a climbing shoe~ it does its job. I use it mostly for climbing indoors~ but the Mad Rock Science Friction sole works amazingly on real rock where foot holds are non-existant. The velcro strap allow for a perfect fit~ whether you like your shoe tight or just right.   Bottom line~ I would recommend this shoe as a good indoor climbing shoe. Semi-agressive toe that doesn't leave you looking like a footbound Chinese woman after taking it off.
734,mad-rock,flash,4.5,   I’ve climbed in all-brands of shoes in my years~ and I figured I’d finally give Mad Rock a try. I chose the Flash because of their easy velcro closure~ and not overly-aggressive rand~ I’m glad I did. They fit really well and true to street shoe size (9.5). It’s also nice that they’re unlined (definitely keeps odors down)~ and the padded overlapping toungue is really comfortable so you can really pull the velcro down snug.    The rubber is great. It’s a little softer than what I’m used to~ so I’d stay away from climbing trad and edging~ but I found it to be really great for higher friction climbs. Great shoes for bouldering and sport. It worked perfectly on sandstone~ and gritty conglomerate rock. The heel-cup is really the best part. I believe last time I was out~ a bystanding climber accused me of having the “cheater heel” because it works so well. (Turn that foot out—it works every time!)    So anyway~ for $75~ you really can’t beat the price and performance. Way to go Mad Rock! 
735,mad-rock,flash,4.0,   Great deal for the price! The fit is perfect for me and I love the ease of getting shoes on and off. Edged and smeared well. Used it for many types of climbs: face~ crack~ sport~ multi-pitch trad~ sandstone and granite.... There is stickier rubber around but the madrubber lasts long and gripped sure enough on anything I climbed. Being quite heavy on rubber I appreciated the bit of extra thickness (5.3mm).
736,mad-rock,flash,4.0,   These shoes were my first ever climbing shoes. I bought them mainly for indoor climbing. They seem to be holding up just fine. The rubber has very good grip and seems to smear well. I love the easy on and off velcro straps. Overall a good beginner shoe and the cost is not too bad either.
737,mad-rock,flash,3.0,   My first pair of climbing shoes. Great beginner shoes for limestone and granite alike and a good price. Decent performance on cracks (jams) and good durability. These lasted me 8 months using about 3-4 times/month. Just watch out for orange feet after initial use.
738,mad-rock,flash,4.0,   These shoes were my first ever pair of climbing shoes~ and I used them exclusively in the gym. They edged extremely well and smeared great when I got them~ but three months later the rubber has almost no smearing power~ and I can barely edge. Good thing is I can get them resoled...   However~ that's the extent of the negative stuff. They hook better than every shoe I've ever tried (although I'll admit I've only tried the Anasazi~ Katana~ and Mythos) and the velcro straps do a fairly good job at getting it fit to your foot. Very comfortable~ great beginner shoe. Get them a half to a full size smaller though~ because they'll stretch.    My only real complaints with the shoe are its durability~ although it should be noted that I climbed every day in the gym with them for three months~ and the stretch factor~ as I got my size because it was fairly tight. The rubber isn't as nice as what you'll get in an Anasazi or Katana~ but then those shoes are alot nicer.    It will make your foot very orange. My feet are still very orange every time I take them off three months later~ but the fact that they're the reddish orange that they are (which I think is pretty sweet) makes up for it. Also~ two holds in the heal allow for pulling on and off very quickly and easily.   If you're a more experienced climber I'd suggest going with a sculpted heal as I like it more for all around climbing~ and the top of the Flash's heal begins to get loose when edging and heal hooking~ but for a beginner this shoe is a 5/5.
739,mad-rock,flash,3.0,   These shoes perform well in the gym. I have yet to try them on granite or limestone since I bought them. The price hooked me~ however as with everything else in climbing~ I should have spent a little more for a better product. Wouldn't recommend them for multi-pitch climbs~ comfort level is only so-so. Other Mad Rock shoes around the same price are more comfortable. Better luck next time~ I guess.
740,scarpa,force-v,4.5,"   A perfect step up from the Origin for those looking to increase their performance without getting aggressive.       The fit tapers from a narrowed heel to a medium-wide toebox.   Pros   Cons   Preface: I'm mainly a gym climber~ though I occasionally go outdoors. For rating reference I climb at Stronghold in Los Angeles.   For about six months I climbed mainly using Scarpa Origins. I wanted to get a nicer pair of shoes to see what the fuss was about~ and so I tried a pair of LS Miura Velcros for a while~ but found them to be too uncomfortable and didn't fit my foot profile well. While returning them I saw something new~ something exciting.   In comes the Force V.   I mainly wanted something that's a bit more performance oriented than the Origins~ but I still wanted it to be comfortable enough to walk around the gym in as I'm a lazy bastard. I also found I had little issue climbing 5.11's in the gym using my Origins so I saw no need to move to an aggressive shoe.   I got these a half size down from my Origins as I wanted that tight performance fit~ and it took me about 2-3 weeks of discomfort before they really started breaking in~ but after that it's pretty much perfect.   These are an upgrade to the Origins in pretty much every way. They're more comfortable~ they have better grip~ and they're more precise.   Will they suddenly cause you to send as hard as Adam Ondra? That depends on how hard you shout.   Will they support your journey to climb hard and better? Most definitely.   I would say these are the shoes to get if you want to upgrade from gumby shoes and focus more on developing good technique as their lack of aggressive shape makes them potentially harder to use on higher level climbs~ which will demand better footwork and balance. Is this a kind of backwards logic? Sure~ but it works for me and I don't have to take my shoes off every 5 minutes.   Only downside? I don't like climbing outdoors in these as much as I do in my Origins. Because you spend so much time sitting on your feet while climbing outdoors looking for your next hold (""Is that really the only hold on this slab~ a crimp that's almost worse than my love life? There's gotta be something better..."" *5 eternities later* ""God dammit~ that's the only hold."")~ and because they're more sensitive and so tight my feet get tired and sore way faster then in my Origins~ which in turn causes me to climb worse because now I'm trying to avoid pain~ no bueno.   But if you don't size foot bindingly tight this shouldn't be an issue and in any case~ I'm still climbing mostly moderates outdoors so my Origins work perfectly~ plus they have a longer lasting sole. Gotta save pennies somehow..."
741,evolv,addict,4.5,   If you can climb in slip-ons~ you can do anything in these. They tackle any objective with grace and power. I am sold.   Pros   Cons   FIT:   These shoes fit me perfectly. I have a wider foot~ but my heel is average. They have no dead spaces~ hot spots~ or slippage. I bought exactly to my street shoe size (11.5)~ and they are ideal for all of my pursuits. This is my first pair of slip-ons~ and I may be sold for life.   COMFORT:   These were ready to go pretty much out of the box~ with only two long sessions needed to break them in. I haven't had a single issue with them in terms of comfort~ and I rarely ever take my shoes off when climbing~ even during a belay. If you're used to wearing mildly aggressive climbing shoes~ these will be a dream. They actually fit tight enough around the lower ankle to keep out sand~ pine needles~ etc.   SUPPORT:   These are for people with strong feet. If you are someone who relies on a stiffer last in a shoe~ these will be a major challenge~ and maybe not worth it. I have always preferred a more flexible shoe~ and these are quite so~ especially once broken in. Given~ if you were to size them down a bit~ they would constrict your foot~ making it stiffer.    WATER RESISTANCE:   They're climbing shoes. Made of leather. Don't use them for fly fishing.   TRACTION:   I thought I wasn't a fan of the Trax rubber compound~ then I got the Addicts. They broke in quickly~ and once that happened the rubber softened perfectly. Most say these excel on desert stone (Joshua Tree~ Indian Creek)~ but the first trip I did in them was Yosemite~ where I found them to be perfectly grippy. Given~ anything will perform better on J-Tree's griptastic Monzonite~ but the Addicts hold their own anywhere.    TEMP CONTROL:   Despite being solid leather and rubber~ the Addicts deal fairly well with heat. No matter how cold it is~ my feet eventually sweat when I climb~ and I have done some long multipitch routes in these when it's fairly warm out. The suede is pretty absorbent~ allowing for some wicking. There is no liner~ but as a result~ they dry quickly.   EASE OF USE:   They slip on and off~ which makes for a quick and lovely experience every time you put them on. They are very consistent in their performance~ and don't seem to vary too much with temperature changes.    FEATURES:   The only outstandingly different thing about these feature-wise is the inclusion of a slight downturn~ which is pretty unusual for a slip-on. This is not noticeable when crack climbing or smearing~ but on anything overhanging~ you can just barely get a hook on some holds with some deft footwork. Otherwise~ they follow the classic mold of a moccasin style slip-on~ of course with the small details Evolv chose to change. Nothing unnecessary~ everything works.   CONSTRUCTION & DURABILITY:   They seem to be very well made~ and the simplicity of construction allows few failures. I have put them through the wringer in my time using them~ and they have held up excellently.   I have had these for about two months~ and in that time I've climbed a huge amount in them. I've spent time in Yosemite~ Tahoe~ Bishop~ Phantom Spires~ San Luis Obispo~ and the gym~ and in every single place I've been impressed with their performance. Throughout all those trips I've done long easy multipitch~ both slab and hand/fist crack~ hard technical bouldering~ and seriously tenuous finger crack. Despite a huge variety of situations~ the Addicts were ideal in every one~ and I had a great time using them!    BOTTOM LINE:   If you want one shoe that is easy to pack in anywhere~ has simple and well-considered features~ and kicks ass at climbing~ then the Addicts are a good choice. I've been surprised many times with how great mine are~ and I'm sure that's not a unique perspective.
742,five-ten,rogue,4.5,   Bought this pair while visiting Edinburgh this year. These are my first climbing shoes so I can't compare them to anything else. I must say that for the money you get really good product -- the performance is outstanding if you just start climbing -- they smear great~ heel hook awesome.   They have a little problem with edging though~ despite the fact that i wear them quite tight. Most of the time i use them for bouldering (as i enjoy it more) but they are also great for single pitch routes at your local gym.   Regarding the fit - I bought them a half size smaller than my normal shoes and that is more than enough to have your toes cramped. And they won't stretch much~ so keep it in mind when choosing a size! Usually they are not comfortable the moment i put them on~ but after some 5 minutes as your foot warms the shoe they fit much better and snug.   I can't say that C4 rubber is the best one out there. What is more it feels quite stiff and not that sticky (compered to Vibram)~ so when i am working on overhangs they tend to slip much. But these shoes are the entry-level~ so one can't expect them to work as Solutions or Testarosa i guess.   All in all these are great for pushing your performance further. They last long~ fit tight~ help to develop fundamental skills and even some of a higher level.   I would definitely recommend them as your first PERFORMANCE shoes!   Stay safe and have a great climbing~ folks!
743,boreal,kintaro,4.5,   Supper comfortable aggressive climbing shoe. Amazingly sticky rubber (these shoes literally stick together). The new V2 Rand system keeps an aggressive fit forcing the toe forward and keeping heels tight for heel hooking.   Pros   Cons   After ten years of climbing and trying to find a shoe that performed at the highest level~ while maintaining a comfortable fit~ I have come full circle to the inventors of sticky rubber.   The heel cup fits my narrow heel with no dead space. The forefoot knuckles the toes into a good position of power with out the pain of Chinese foot binding usually associated with high end shoes. I bought them as directed on the Boreal website in my street shoe size.  With this sizing they are great for sport or multipitch sport routes~ they also boulder well and stand on smeary edges wonderfully.   Onlined leather comfortably wraps around the foot with out losing shape over time and does not gain the death sent of synthetic shoes. The V2 rand system works like a charm maintaing positive forward control of the foot~ a secure fit for heel hooking and does not cause pain in the achilles.   Oh~ and the sticky on this rubber smears and smedges better than any other rubber on the market. Boreal has me as a customer for life.
744,scarpa,booster,4.0,   Very specific shoe in my opinion. This shoe was made with 45 degrees and over climbing in mind and that's about it.   Excels at cave bouldering feels like you have hooks on the bottom of your feet but god forbid you try to climb something vertical in them or have to do any kind of smearing.    Now keep in mind that does not I repeat DOES NOT make this a bad shoe it's just a much more specific shoe then an Anazasi or a Moc but if you're looking at a shoe this aggressive you probably already know that.    The heel section while not having and real rubber per say holds very well and I've not felt secure heel hooking with them. Toe hooking is also very nice due to the rubber covered toe box.   As for fit I down sized 1 1/2 from my street shoe and they are a little on the tight side. Even thought they are full leather that have a triangular rubber toe cap that keeps the toe box from stretching too much if I could redo I would probably just go down one size. There is a slight bit of leather near the Achilles tendon that digs in a bit at the beginning but that softens up nice after a few sessions.   Overall great mega aggressive shoe for bouldering and steep sport climbing just know that you're going to need more then one shoe if you like to climb any more than that.   
745,scarpa,booster,4.5,   Too aggressive...as if that's a bad thing. These shoes are great for overhangs! The down-turned toe is a real plus for clinging on to small jigs on ceilings....unfortunately the same cannot be said for completely vertical surfaces.    It took me a while to get used to the Booster in comparison to my Katanas~ but I've grown to love them. Overall~ it's a great shoe for the aggressive climber...but beginners beware. 
746,la-sportiva,tarantulace,4.0,   Very grippy soles. I like that these shoes have laces to stay tight on your feet.    Pros   Cons   I bought these used and was very pleased with the purchase. The shoes fit my feet to a T~ and are a comfortable fit for climbing shoes.   I have used these for both outdoor and indoor climbing~ and the shoes have been great for both. The soles are great for smearing and are very grippy. 
747,la-sportiva,tarantulace,4.0,   It is not amazingly comfortable~ but it's a rock climbing shoe~ so it's not supposed to be. It is great for indoor climbing at the gym.    Pros   Cons   I bought these to go indoor climbing at the YMCA. They are much better than just using normal tennis shoes. I also used the shoes at the Y~ but it's nice to have my own pair. I bought them from REI.   I strongly recommend having an employee help you try them on because they will feel tight~ but they are supposed to be tight~ so they can create a platform with your toes for surfaces without big bumps to step on. I have not yet used them outside~ but I am excited to go on a climbing trip in August to try them out for real climbing.   The only issue I have is that they rub my feet a little~ especially in the heel area~ but that has improved as I broke them in.   I like the fact that it laces up. I feel that laces give the wearer more freedom than velcro when deciding how tight or loose to make the shoe.   I got the Tarantalace in teal blue~ and it's very pretty. Everyone who I have talked to has said that La Sportiva is one of the best brands of climbing shoes~ and the Tarantulace is very durable.
748,la-sportiva,tarantula,4.0,   These are only the second pair of climbing shoes I have owned; the first were a pair of rental castoffs.   It seems like most climbing shoes have this super deep heel cup that my foot doesn't fit into. These fit my heel very well.   I have been climbing on these shoes for three months.   I have pretty poor technique~ so the extra thick rubber sole suits my climbing style well and should last me a while. I am told that when I get better I will want a more sensitive sole.   They edge well and I have climbed slabs with them~ too~ but because I fitted them tight for edging~ they are only okay for slab climbing. I think that if I bought a half size larger they would smear better.   I like the Velcro closure. I feel like it is easier to adjust them throughout the day as comfort dictates.    Fit is a function of how tight you buy them. Tighter shoes work better for edging~ but the tradeoff is that they aren't fun to walk in. These aren't walking shoes.   These are entry shoes that are great for punters like me. Good grip~ and good all-around usability. I am 200 lbs plus some~ and they are stiff enough to grip the rock well for me.
749,evolv,defy,3.5,   Great beginner shoe.   First off the fit. I went with my street size although many go a half size down and be pretty comfortable with it. This is a full synthetic shoe with a nylon mesh liner it will not stretch like a traditional leather shoe~ you may get a half size stretch max but odds are it will be the material breaking in and getting softer as which makes it feel like its stretch as oppose to actually stretching.   This shoe is a pretty decent beginner to intermediate shoe that does everything well but nothing great. It offers enough support through out the sole to allow for decent enough edging for most beginners to intermediates as well as decent smearing.    I wouldn't suggest heal hooking in these shoes as the one area on the shoe that bags is the heel and I have many a scar from it slipping mid problem. That being said this shoe was never designed to be a super aggressive bouldering shoe so one can't really complain.   The older Tx-5 rubber is not as sticky as the newer Eco Tx-5 in my opinion but it is durable as hell probably more so then Vibrams or C4 which is good for people with sloppy footwork.   Finally the smell. Yes it does smell~ yes it smells worse then unlined leather shoes~ yes if you leave them in your car you will know the next time you get into said vehicle. This is just the nature of the beast with a synthetic lined shoe and is not really new. The 5.10 Anasazis have the same problem as well as the Galileos and all other lined synthetic shoes.    Now there are some preventative measure that can be take such as airing out thoroughly after each use don't just throw them in your gym bag wet. Secondly silica gel packs that help to absorb moisture can help as well just chuck a few in each shoe after you wear them. Keeping them dry is the name of the game.    
750,evolv,defy,4.5,   These are my comfy shoes and smearing shoe. Medium last and a small heel. If you have a small heel you will like the fit.   They are extremely comfortable even when fit tight~ which you should do. They do stretch a lot for a synthetic shoe. After stretching an out of the box insane tight fit (you should not even be able to put them on) will become painful tight~ however~ a painful (yet tolerable for 2-3 problems) tight fit out of the box will become sport/bouldering tight for 5-10 routes at a time~ and a comfy yet snug out of the box will will need wool socks to tighten them back up.     Originally I had intended to go with a 8.5 which was a snug but good fit without stretch~ but the rep told me to go smaller and he was absolutely right. I went as small as I could get my feet into and after about 1 week of use they felt great.   In an earlier review someone said that the fit is off. That is absolutely not true~ they just size them U.S.A. style. Five ten also sizes on the same idea.  La Sportiva sizing is based on the actual size of the shoe as are many European shoes~ so you should size down from your street shoe size. In Sportiva I wear a 41.5 (about 8.5 U.S.) in approach~ running~ or casual shoe but a 39 or 39.5 (6.5-7 U.S.).    Evolv sizing is based on the size of your foot. In Evolve I wear an 8.5 approach/hiking shoe and an 8.5 (long route or downturned shoe) and an 8 in a performance flat lasted shoe.     So basically If you wear a 39 Sportiva (or other Italian shoe) and you order that size in a an Evolv shoe you have just ordered a shoe that should fit performance tight on someone who wears a comfortable size 6.5 U.S. street shoe.   Just order your street shoe size or one half size less for a tight fit. If they still don't fit evolve or the online retailer where you bought them will exchange the shoe easily.
751,evolv,defy,2.0,   Don't buy them online or by catalog! Try them on first.   I didn't have a chance to test their climbing qualities. So~ this is not what I am writing about.   The problem is: they are made with wrong size.   I ordered a pair of Evolv Defy climbing shoes over the Internet.   I ordered the size that I always wear. When I received them~ they appeared to be at least 1.5 sizes smaller.  I simply couldn't pull them on.   So~ I had to return them. Manufacturer claimed that the shoes are OK~ so~ I was down $15 -- shipping to me and back.   I have no basis to judge their performance. Because of wrong size~ I wasn't given a chance to do it.
752,evolv,defy,4.5,   I really liked these shoes. They perform very well in the gym and on rock. I really like how quick they go on~ and the fact that they are pretty comfortable~ and still work as well as some shoes that kill your feet. They are very comfortable~ and perform quite well.    My only complaint is they wear out a bit quicker than some of the 5.10's I've had~ as well as they start to smell...
753,evolv,defy,3.0,   All around awesome shoe. The problems that I have run into with it is the heel rubber on the back seperated~ the heel itself ripped at one of the pull tabs~ making any heel hook impossible. Also~ I blew threw the rubber on the toe and I am using my big toe as friction now. For the five months that they lasted they were awesome. The problems that occured to me though~ are most likely due to that fact that I got them in an 8 where I wear 11....
754,evolv,defy,4.0,   Great fit~ good control~ but the rubber is too soft wearing out prematurely.
755,la-sportiva,mythos-eco,3.5,"   The Mythos Eco is a great all-day climbing shoe that has been redesigned~ using 95 percent recycled materials~ without compromising quality and function. This product is designed for both indoor and outdoor use~ and has superior comfort for all day use~ whether working on projects in the gym~ or long multi-pitch routes.       Pros   Cons   After 25 years of being a climber’s favorite~ Las Sportiva has announced a re-edition of their classic shoe. The Mythos Eco looks nearly identical as its predecessor~ however boasts a 95% recycled build. Virtually every aspect of the Mythos Eco is the same as the most recent Mythos shoe~ and the quality of the highly recycled product has not suffered.    The product tester is primarily an indoor climber at the beginner/intermediate level~ aspiring to become an outdoor climber.  The Mythos Eco has been tested mostly for top rope and lead climbing~ with a bit of bouldering sprinkled in.        La Sportiva has been handcrafting handmade products for the outdoor enthusiast since 1929~ based out of northern Italy. The Mythos Eco was awarded a Root Award from REI for its sustainable design.       Specifications:    Note: The regular Mythos shoe is still available~ priced at $140.        Break-In: Initial break-in was a slight surprise~ but these climbing shoes became very comfortable after approximately six sessions of gym climbing. Beyond this point~ the Mythos Eco became a shoe that could stay on for hours~ without the need to be removed.   The Mythos is known for being one of most comfortable climbing shoes made~ however testing showed the shoes need break-in time! Part of the shoe’s comfort has to do with an overall neutral sole~ the other being a very soft leather that molds to the wearer once broken in.    Fit: Generally speaking~ La Sportiva climbing shoes are known to fit ""true to size~"" however the Mythos Eco tested seemed to fit a little larger than expected. Wearing a 10.5-11 street shoe~ the 44 Mythos Eco initially fit with a small amount of free room. With a high arch and narrow foot~ the possible fit concern quickly dissolved once the shoe broke in. Additional adjustments to the lacing system brought a glove-like fit. Overall volume in the shoe feels normal~ without free play in the heel~ or toe box.    The lacing system of the Mythos has both pros and cons. The seemingly limitless fine-tuning allows the wearer to find great precision~ but at a cost~ Taking the time to learn how to perform these adjustments ultimately is well worth the effort. The lacing system wraps from behind the heel~ then down over the top of the foot~ creating the cross-portion of the lace. This torques the lace~ allowing the wearer to individually set then tension up and down the foot.    For those interested to see how La Sportiva’s patented lacing system works:       The sole has tested to be very good~ showing above average edging and ability performing toe/heel hooks. Considering the neutral sole~ edging can be done confidently. Maneuvers like smearing and crack climbing were found to be average; these aren’t the most tacky climbing shoes. Frequent cleaning has been necessary to prevent slipping; proper care must be made to make sure that the rubber is clean in order to perform. It is also critical to store climbing shoes where it doesn’t get too hot~ nor cold~ in order to avoid damage.     Photos of wear after approximately six months of useThe Mythos Eco was used about twice weekly for six monthsConsidering the Mythos Eco is manufactured from 95 percent recycled materials~ this shoe is top-notch construction. No durability concerns have been noted during the approximate six months of testing. It should be stated that this is not an appropriate amount of time to judge the overall lifespan of climbing shoes.    Construction: Per La Sportiva~ ""95% of components come from recycled materials (soles~ laces~ webbing~ tongue padding) and contribute to a reduced environmental impact (metal-free tanning~ biodegradable leather~ water-based adhesives). La Sportiva Eco rubber outsole obtained by recycling rubber used during the production process at the La Sportiva factory with no sacrifice in performance."" The regular Mythos model appears to be identical outside of its mostly recycled nature~ and color choice.      The La Sportiva Mythos Eco has been tested from summer to early winter~ 2018 indoors. A combination of bouldering~ top rope~ and lead climbing has been the upper limits of the tester’s capability; hopefully a more dry year will allow for future outdoor testing.       Many thanks to the people at La Sportiva for the opportunity to test the Mythos Eco for the Trailspace Gear Review Corps.      Experience   The product tester has been climbing on a beginner to intermediate level for approximately three years. Other climbing shoe brands that have been tested are Evolv and Scarpa. This product has been tested in several indoor climbing gyms from summer to early winter 2018. Types of climbing during testing: bouldering~ top rope~ sport lead. Hopefully 2019 will offer opportunities for outdoor climbing!"
756,mad-rock,phoenix,1.0,   Sure you can get an agressive fit out of the box but it streches out in a few days to a running shoe fit. Also there is no rubber on the toe which makes cracks a pain and the places where the rubber overlaps the bottom of the laces seems to be a less than durable spot. You can get a much better shoe for the money like the Mad Rock Flash (no personal experience but I've heard it's awesome). The biggest problem with the Phoenix is the stretching. You will buy the right fit but the shoe will be useless after a few trips. Pay the extra ten bucks or whatever for the Flash or anything else other than this piece of junk that won't stretch out.  
757,mad-rock,phoenix,3.0,   At first~ the rubber seems rather flimsy~ but once you break this shoe in~ the rubber is indeed sticky. As a person who generally relies on stealth rubber~ gryptonite has exceeded all my expectations. Resoling this shoe is also pretty idiot-proof.    For the most part~ this shoe takes time getting comfortable in. The stiff backing causes minor abrasions on the back of your heel. The rubber is a bit thicker than the other shoes I've owned~ leading towards less sensitivity. I found this shoe to be less flexible than other shoes due to the stiff heel and thicker rubber. This shoe has also given me a little problems when crack climbing~ since it's less form fitting than my previous shoe.    As for durability~ these shoes have shown minor wear after perhaps two months of climbing. The stitching has held up well~ but I'm not sure about how long the rubber will last. Already there is a definite marking around the toe-area. 
758,mad-rock,phoenix,3.5,   Pretty good shoe. I liked them for easier routes. The hooker heel is nice for those heel hooks. Aggressive enough for a beginner who is progressing.
759,mad-rock,phoenix,2.5,   Comfortable beginner shoe. This was my first climbing shoe and used it a lot for easy climbs~ and never failed me. I have now more technical shoes~ but these ones were so comfortable~ that I might resole them for the long day climbs outside on easy routes.
760,mad-rock,phoenix,4.0,   This fit my slim foot very well. It also performed admirably the first several times I took it out bouldering. The only problem was that it stretched more than I thought it would~ and I ended up returning it after 2 or 3 weeks because I couldn't hold a small edge well anymore. I ended up with a La Sportiva  Cliff~ which I'm hoping stretches less.     I'd say it's a good beginner shoe~ especially if you don't climb that often. But I'd recommend getting a smaller size than is at all comfortable at first.  
761,mad-rock,phoenix,4.0,   Definately a good beginner shoes with a classy lace-up design. I bring them to any pitch for their comfort and versatility on various rock and gym surfaces. I've had mine for about 9 months now and my only complaint is the toes losing their point a bit. Definitely go for a 1/2 to even a full size smaller than your street shoes to keep your toes and heel firm. 
762,five-ten,anasazi-verde,4.5,   Probably my favorite climbing shoe. Great for trad~ sport~ and even bouldering. They do it all.   Pros   Cons   I bought these shoes about 10 months ago as I was looking something better for long trad routes. I took these out to lone peak on their first day out and the performed flawlessly. Great fit for heel and toes~ and the lacing system makes them fit just right.   Then I was surprised to find out that even though I did not size them down and get a super tight fit~ they work well for difficult sport routes. They easily handle 5.12 climbing. They tend to do well bouldering in the gym as well. I pull out my five-ten team climbing shoes for any boulder problems that are super thin.   I love five ten rubber. It's the stickiest. I have tried every brand~ and I think it's the best.   Get these shoes. They won't disappoint.
763,five-ten,anasazi-verde,5.0,   The Five Ten Anasazi line have always been my favorite climbing shoes~ whether it be the velcro~ moc or the laceup. In particular I love the laceup~ for that extra bit of precision and snug heel fit.    Pros   Cons   Another big pro for me is the stiffness of the footbed~ being a bigger guy~ the stiff rubber really allows me to bear down on the smallest of edges. I would recommend this shoe to anyone~ but remember each foot is different and you may not have the same experience as me!
764,five-ten,anasazi-verde,5.0,"   The meat and potatoes from my review on my site:   Oh Anasazi Verde~ how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:  One - I love thee to the depth and breadth my sole can reach~ And how your laced~ synthetic Cowdura uppers comfortably swaddled my wide foot each.Two - I love thee to climb for eight hour plus days~Oh~ Stealth Onyxx Rubber think of the rocks we'll abrade!Three - I love thee with the passion to put you to good use~And how your slingshot heel seeks sketchy hooks to seduce.And finally~ Four - Look how dope that green color is~ kid!  So fresh~ right!?Seriously though~ I thought these shoes might be a bit much for a beginner climber~ but if you're going to the local crag or gym regularly~ it's an awesome shoe to grow into.I sized these for comfort and opted to go with my normal size 10.  With that said~ they're tight.  My toes~ thanks to the heel design~ fill in the toe box nicely and after a few long sessions~ I'm not detecting any stretch or dead spaces up front~ or out back.  I'm still developing my feel~ but I would say the shoes give me good feedback as to where or what my feet are on or trying to find.  The feel can get a little muted when I try to stand on the very front of the toe box~ but I think this issue is a product of the sizing I prefer.    Edging~ both inside and out~ on the other hand is nice.  I hear the term ""dime"" tossed around a lot~ and well~ I'm not near that type of climbing prowess yet~ so I wouldn't know if they can edge on one.  I can tell you they'll edge easily on a~ say~ pencil eraser?The back of this shoe is what really gets me all giddy.  As you can probably imagine~ my foot work needs work~ but I swear~ if I can get my heel on it in these pups~ the move is going down.  The design of the heel is easily my favorite part of this shoe and if the laces aren't undone~ the shoes aren't coming off.To wrap this up~ I'm sure everyone falls in love with their first pair of climbing shoes~ and I'm no different~ but I really think I made a smart buy. One of the most attractive things about climbing to me is that you seem to get better every time you go and with that in mind~ I'm glad I bought a shoe that will keep up with my progress.    I love you~ my little Verdes~ let me continue to count the ways..."
765,five-ten,anasazi-verde,4.5,"   The Five Ten Anasazi Verde is a great precision climbing shoe. This is to say that when sized correctly to the intended fit~ the Anasazi Verde is very snug~ but definitely not painful nor debilitating by climbing shoe standards. I have no problems staying in them for the 2-3 hours of my usual climbing gym session. That said~ the back of my ankle becomes sore from the slingshot heel.   The toebox of the Anasazi Verde is not the same as that of the Five Ten Galileo~ my prior pair of high-performance shoes. For me~ the Galileo is slightly wider~ and has less of a protrusion for the index-toe. I'd say that the Galileo fits my wide (E) forefoot a little better than the Verde~ especially being that I do not have a particularly pronounced index toe. The Verde leaves a little more space for my index toe~ so I have to make more of an effort to hold a toe-point and when edging on the outside. This is of course all a matter of fit~ so YMMV.   However~ the Anasazi Verde has an undeniably more solid heel. Whereas I can size a pair of Galileos to the point where I'm hating life~ the heel will never feel as secure as the Verde's~ even when the latter is sized comfortably (relatively). This shoe is great for high-and-sketchy heel-hooks.   (Ideal fantasy-shoe-that-doesn't-exist-yet for me would be a Galileo toebox mated to an Anasazi Verde mid/heel.)   As always~ the Steath Onyxx rubber is terrific. That said~ it does have an optimal temperature range. It takes about 10-15 minutes for a pair of cold shoes to come up to the temperature of your feet. When that happens~ the Onyxx is great on most stuff. But it seems to me that it's a little soft for Joshua Tree NP (mostly quartz monzonite~ a very rough and crystalline granite) on a warm day (mid-80s).  I've heard that Mad Rock rubbers work better at those temps.   BTW~ me and another user of higher-end Five Ten shoes w/ Onyxx rubber and synthetic ""Cowdura"" have noticed that aside from not stretching~ these shoes actually get a *little* SMALLER over time. However~ do not size with this observation in mind as the effect is very minimal~ maybe to the tune of a 1/4 size.   If Five Ten would develop an entire line of Anasazis differentiated by different widths and toebox shapes~ then I'll erect an altar to them."
766,five-ten,anasazi-verde,5.0,"   I have been climbing for over 10 years. Most of my climbing style is gym and bouldering/sport climbing. I have owned Five Ten Huecos (the old purple)~ which are a great~ comfortable all-day shoe. I also have the Anasazi velcro style which was my favorite all around shoe. This new Anasazi Verde lace-up is the best of both worlds. It is comfortable and super sticky with the onyx sole. All the ""vacant"" areas in the heel are gone. I have a terror foot to fit (a width heel~ e width front). The tight heel and lace-up closure takes care of both problems. This is the climbing shoe that other companies need to check out.      Thank you~ Five Ten. "
767,five-ten,galileo,5.0,   A great all around shoe. Very durable. I bought this shoe in 2009 and have done countless hours of gym climbing as well as outdoor climbing. I am now sending it in to get resoled since I like the shoe so much.   Pros   Cons   The shoe fits a little wide. The suede will stretch a little after heavy use. Very comfortable fit if fitted properly. Very durable shoe. This is a high quality American made product.
768,five-ten,galileo,5.0,"   Great shoe~ will buy again if these get trashed. This is a relatively stiff/supportive shoe for edging~ but it smears okay. The materials and construction are fairly durable~ and the Stealth Onyx rubber is indeed both stickier and more durable than the industry-reference Stealth C4.    In general~ Five Ten shoes are designed for wider feet than Mad Rock or Italian makes~ and the Galileo is no exception. The designed fit is a good compromise between performance and comfort~ with a straight big toe butting (somewhat tightly) against the end~ and remaining toes curled (not tightly) against the end.  The synthetic upper backed with lining stretches VERY LITTLE~ if at all~ meaning that the fit you get initially is the fit you will keep. (You better make sure that's the fit you want.  Undersize it~ and the pain will never go away as it will NOT ""stretch-to-fit"".) I have found that the Five Ten sizing scheme for this shoe matches your running/tennis shoe size~ assuming you have those fit correctly for performance."
769,five-ten,galileo,5.0,   I absolutely love these shoes. I have the sport/trad model (ones with the roadrunner near the toes). They are a great all around shoe. I've done multi-pitch routes with them and they were still comfortable after five pitchs. They fit great too. The heel cup is perfect. It really holds your heel in there when doing heel hooks and whatnot. The Onyx rubber is incredible you can definitely tell a difference. If you're looking for a high performace shoe that can do it all and still be comfortable the Galileo is your shoe.
770,five-ten,galileo,4.0,   A great shoe!   It will realy help you climb harder routes... You can probably do the 89% but this will make you do the last ten percent (face it~ nothing will help you for the last 1%.
771,five-ten,prima-slipper,5.0,"   This is a great shoe. The Prima~ despite its scant appearance~ is a great performer~ comfortable out of the box~ and I have no problems whatsoever keeping it on my foot. Since it was cheap~ initially I just bought it to be a ""gym shoe"" so I wouldn't tear up my Sportiva Miuras (also a great shoe) indoors at the gym~ but the Primas have become my go-to shoe for bouldering~ because they are so easy to get on and off.    I bought a 1/2 size smaller than my street shoes~ and they fit great.  I'm going to stockpile these so I can keep wearing them after FiveTen no longer has them in stock."
772,five-ten,prima-slipper,5.0,"   WOW! I have to say I was super skeptical when I first saw someone wearing these. I thought~ ""How the heck is THAT going to stay on your foot?"" Well~ surprisingly well!   There was a Five Ten rep at a comp I was at~ so I thought I'd test them out.  I boulder and do a lot of heel hooking~ and I NEVER thought these would be as sweet as they are. They're super light~ very flexible and comfortable~ and somehow they don't slip off my heels even when digging in on a thin edge! Great! I love 'em.  Buy a pair! You won't regret it! I DO feel like a precise little ballerina in these!"
773,five-ten,anasazi-vcs,5.0,   Bottom line--These shoes are god's gift to every climber with narrow feet and a low volume heel (the womens specific model). They're the most versatile shoe I've ever worn; I've worn them bouldering~ sport~ trad~ and multi-pitch climbing.    Once broken in~ they're really comfortable too. I bought these shoes a couple months before I left for a 6 month climbing trip~ and I wore them most days. Now (a year later)~ they are just starting to show signs of needing to be replaced/resoled. And I have to add-- even though the edges are pretty much nonexistent at this point~ they still edge like the day I bought them.   Even though it can be hard to find these shoes for less than $100~ it will probably save you money in the long run to buy them~ because they're so versatile and durable. Enjoy!
774,five-ten,anasazi-vcs,5.0,   This is by far the best climbing shoe ever made. I have more than 10 partners who swear by them. They edge unbelievable well and are extremely comfortable since it molds to your feet. They are better for wider feet.  La Sportiva is known for people with narrower feet.  There is minimal stretch because of the cowdura lining.  I have probably seven pairs that I've gone thru.    The only downside is the cost~ $130. My friends and I have tried cheaper brands that look like the Anasazi~ but the quality in stitching and rubber is unmatched.  5-ten is known to have the best rubber~ stealth. And their new rubber onyx is supposedly more stickier and durable. I don't know this since I haven't tried the rubber. I've climbed for over 10 years and tried all the major brands.
775,la-sportiva,cobra,4.5,   These are my favorite gym climbing shoe. They are super comfortable and work great for mostly everything.      Pros   Cons   These shoes are best when you first get them~ right as you're breaking them in because they are super tight. Super easy to get your feet in and out of even before breaking them in.   The only downfall is sizing is tricky~ as once they break in and stretch out the heel gets loose if you don't go small enough. The rubber is thin enough where they are super responsive~ yet not thin enough where you will blow through them in 2 months.   I think I've had my Cobras for about 6 months at a time before I get a hole in the toe.
776,la-sportiva,cobra,5.0,   I used these shoes in a local climbing comp at which La Sportiva let people try using the shoes for free.  I used a 36.5 which is about 2 full sizes smaller than what I usually wear.  Their performance was every bit worth the pain. The whole point of a demo is to convince people to buy their shoes and it totally worked on me.
777,la-sportiva,cobra,4.0,"   The Cobras are my 7th pair of shoes in the last 3 years~ and by far the best gym~ sport shoe. I thought my foot was wide~ as I have the so called ""foot-gut"" thing~ but La Sportiva seem to fit me better than other brands even though they say it should suit narrow feet. They DO stretch quite a bit and heel hooking after this happens can pull the heel clean off your foot. The Cobras turned down toe is far less painful on toe knuckles than other shoes which is great. Painfully tight shoes detract from performance and the motivation to climb. Not for multipitch~ slab or crack but otherwise sweet."
778,la-sportiva,cobra,5.0,   So far I've had a pair of Boreal Stingers (bought too small — they really don't stretch too much and don't hold a stretch)~ 5.10 Moccasyms (great all around slipper with awesome rubber) and these La Sportiva Cobras.    Gotta love the Cobras--favorite shoe so far. I like the Moccasyms but they stretch too much and the sizing from left to right is weird. These Cobras have plenty of sticky rubber and they fit wonderfully. You can edge on tiny edges~ and they smear well~ they can also be worn on multipitches (2 or 3 at most) but beware of foot pain when doing that. I love them and will  most likely get another pair soon (rubber almost gone) or get them resoled in some C4!!  Look for them on sale and you won't regret the purchase.
779,la-sportiva,cobra,4.0,   This is an excellent technical climbing shoe. Great for the gym~ bouldering and vertical to overhanging sport routes. Probably not a shoe to be worn all day~ or on multipitch routes. It will grab micro edges on face climbs~ smears well and is decent for toe hooks. Heal hooking is ok. It has stretched some~ but not much. Rubber is long lasting and construction is durable in general. 
780,la-sportiva,cobra,5.0,   An excellent shoe that will never let go of your foot. Believe me it will never let go. My feet aren't the most narrow and apparently this shoe favors narrow feet.  I have to lie down on the ground and have a friend pull AS HARD AS HE CAN to get them off. That being said~ they are a great shoe and offer me a more aggresive alternative to my more comfortable Mad Rocks.
781,la-sportiva,cobra,5.0,   I've rented a million different lace-up shoes and was a little concerned about making my first purchase a slipper. However~ this shoe will NEVER slip or cause any concern of slipping. I went two sizes down and at first had some sharp pains.  As soon as I got climbing they went away and after 3 or 4 day trips they are at least a half size bigger and cause little pain if any. The camber does make it a little harder to smear but my wearing a small size might have something to do with that. Utterly perfect for edging. Watch out for needle sharp points tearing into the soft leather.
782,scarpa,feroce,5.0,   You can put your feet anywhere~ no matter how small or bad the hold can be~ it will definitely stick to it as if it had glue on it. Very trustable and comfortable for everything...thin cracks~ limestone~ it's the shoe I'll leave for the hardest projects. The heel is awesome~ and will also grab very tightly on edges and anything you may think about. 
783,scarpa,feroce,3.0,   heavier shoe than 5-10s or sportivas~ which probably helps give a better toe action and durability. What sucks about the shoe is the wierd ridges that are put on the heel. no clue why they where put there~ maybe for looks? they have absolutely no use on a tight/slopey heel hook~ and on a big heel hook~ there is no need for help anyway.    the rubber all over the toe also interferes with toe hooking~ and i've had them 3 months and the rubber on the toe is peeling from toe hooks.    However~ despite climbing and setting 2-4 times a week~ the toe rubber/edging is still going strong~ which is more than I can say for my anasazis. They have also stayed fitted well~ though they broke in enough so that they're not uncomfortable.
784,scarpa,feroce,5.0,   I got these shoes after using the Sportiva Katanas and the first thing I noticed was how easy it was to pull with them. Then the next thing was the funny lump pushing up from underneath my big toe. At first it feels really horrible~ but now it feels weird not to have it there.    The shoe has got tonnes of really sticky rubber on it so there's no complaining. The heel has got a rubber hooking rail and it's really different to a normal heel because it can slip off unexpectedly which is a shame. I mainly boulder with this shoe~ but it is also legendary on sport routes. The Feroce apparently excels on crack climbing~ however I've not tried it yet. It also works well on slabs and a bit better on vertical.   The Scarpa Feroce is a super good all-rounder~ works best steep climbing using edges and pockets~and the rubber is mad. 
785,five-ten,spire,4.5,   Perfect entry shoe. After 4 years of occasional use on easy routes~ mine have finally blown through... so they last pretty well.    Very comfortable~ very sticky rubber. Not an aggressive shoe at all. Everyone should have a pair for easy multi-pitch slabs.
786,five-ten,spire,4.5,   The Five Ten Spire is one of the best all-around comfort shoes there is. It's great for wearing on long sessions. I'd recommend this shoe to any beginner~ in fact my mother~ father~ and myself all have a pair of these (yes~ they work for men and women).    These shoes DO stretch. While you don't want to buy a shoe too tight as a beginner~ the more technical you get the more you'll realize these do end up conforming to your foot and if you don't buy a little tight you might end up getting some pocketing here or there.   I bought mine just over a year ago and have climbed quite often both indoors and outdoors~ so they stand up to a lot of wear.   It is not the most technical shoe in the world but has gotten me through v6/v7 boulder problems and 5.11c climbs. I'll be moving on to a more technical shoe shortly but will always keep a pair of these around for those lazy days when I'm not so worried about performance and would rather something soft and comfortable.
787,five-ten,spire,4.0,   I used these shoes for my rock climbing training class and they were great. After the class I started using 5-10 Anasazi's and I liked those even more. 5-10 makes great shoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
788,mad-rock,contact,4.0,   awesome all around shoe for me.   i have a high volume foot (wide foot) and the shoe fits snug with no gaps in the front of the shoe near the toe box and in the heel.   the power upper portion of it provides the comfort i want and i don't have to take the shoe off after each problem attempt/send. the best way to describe it would be it's the most comfortable..uncomfortable shoe i've worn. if that makes any sense to you.   edging is nice and the rubber is super soft which give me the sensitivity i like so much.   the only thing that leaves me wanting is the Velcro strap near the top of the shoe. it does the trick but i feel like i want something more substantial there.
789,mad-rock,contact,5.0,   I am impressed with the performance of this shoe. At first I was skeptical about the dual density rubber on the sole~ but I have come to realize the benefits of this technology not only face climbing~ but in cracks.  The shoe is very sensitive like a slipper should be and manages to be precise at the same time due to the aggressive toe configuration.     I would recommend this shoe for sport climbing and bouldering with a tight fit and as an all-arounder with a snug fit. Try the ConTact. You won't be disappointed.
790,la-sportiva,speedster,5.0,   Sweet bouldering shoe for the steeps!   Pros   Cons   Fantastic shoe! I wear these for bouldering only. The rubber goes up and over the toe so you have a huge slab of sticky rubber to tweak in any way imaginable covering the front of your foot. This also means you won't blow through the rand or de-laminate the rubber from the rand on the front of the shoe in a hurry like you will with other shoes.   They will last a long time which is great for a gym shoe that gets thrashed frequently. The shoe also has no edge right out of the box and this will take some time to adapt to. It will make you more sensitive to the pressure you apply to foot-holds and it makes quiet climbing easier.   I love what they've done for my climbing~ it changes the way you use your feet. They heel and toe hook VERY well. Not great for slab but anything overhanging they will dominate except for small pockets.   I wear a 40 in these and my street shoe is a 10.5 in most shoes. They are nice and tight and never slip off. The break in is a bit painful but worth it. Hang in there!
791,bufo,shark,5.0,   Good quality shoes for a reasonable price.   Pros   For the budget conscious person that wants to get a quality products with out breaking the savings account check the Bufo products. I bought these climbing shoes back in 2001 and I am still using them today.   I have to say that I don't hit the climbing wall very often anymore~ but this is a good quality product for a fraction of other fancy brands' prices.   Rubber is sticky and it has a good rubber rand in the side. They have a little bit of camber but they are comfortable.   It is easy to hook your heel and that section has tons of rubber for grip. I bought them a little too small for my size~ shoe size 12 and climb size 11. The left shoe seems to have a stiffer heel that always digs in my skin.   Good amount of lace eyelets to customize your fitting. Laces are of good quality and with a nice steel tip end. The leather is of good quality and with good craftsmanship. They are made in Check Republic.
792,la-sportiva,katana,4.0,   I am a novice weekend climber~ who purchased the La Sportiva Katana climbing shoes two years ago. During this time it has given me many opportunities to test them out and provide useful information for prospective buyers.   Uses   I have used the Katana climbing shoes for bouldering and indoor rock walls. They have other uses but these are types of climbing that I have used them for. My review will be based on these types of climbing. Any climbers who are out on the crag~ may have different experiences using these shoes.   Fit   Rock climbing shoes are very unique in their fit and style. If you are from a country that does not use the metric system you will need to do a conversion to find the correct size for you. Once you have completed the conversion the fit seems to be true to size.    One thing to remember about climbing shoes is that they are meant to be snug on your feet. This will be very important for new climbers and people who have not worn climbing shoes to keep in mind. If sized correctly~ they fit well on the heels and do not rub~ cause discomfort~ or blistering. The shoes have straps instead of laces which make them very easy to take off when resting between climbs. The straps also help customize how tight they are on your foot.   Durability   Over the two years that I have owned these shoes they show only very minor wear and tear. The soles are still attached and the leather uppers have held up well. I still use them every weekend when I climb~ so they continue to have life left in them.   Performance   These shoes have allowed me to bring my climbing to the next level. The sticky soles of the shoes allow the use of foot holds that traditional shoes have not allowed me to use. The minimalist design has helped me to be able to maneuver and feel where my feet are at on the wall.   Final Thoughts   The Katanas are quality shoes that have made it through the test of time. In my opinion they were money well spent. Whether you choose these shoes or another pair~ I wish you the best out on the rock. Happy Climbing!
793,la-sportiva,katana,4.5,"   Awesome shoes! If you're doing advanced bouldering (v7+) you may want something a little more sensitive and down-pointing~ but for intermediate bouldering these shoes are fantastic.   The Good: Almost everything! Great for edging~ smearing~ and heel-hooking. Rubber stickiness is excellent and sensitivity is good. These shoes look cool~ fit great~ and have the best Velcro system of any shoe I've ever tried; the wide straps strap down tight and you get some customization in terms of where you want the straps affixed due to the large circular Velcro patches.   Also the opposing-direction straps (one strap pulls one way~ one the other way) provide a balanced fit~ whereas most Velcro shoes feel like they're being pulled to one side. These shoes stretch very little...how they feel in the store is pretty much how they'll feel a couple of months down the road; so don't buy a painfully tight size thinking they'll loosen up a lot...they won't.   Lastly~ the shoes feel very well made and they're made in Italy.   The Bad: The trim around the heel cup digs into your Achilles area somewhat — it's not terrible but definitely noticeable. However~ over time it does soften up and becomes more comfortable (I don't notice the issue at all anymore). Also~ the metal ""rung"" that the lower Velcro strap passes through can be felt on your foot (on the inside of the shoe). I haven't noticed it being a problem/painful while climbing~ but it's still worth noting.   Overall I love these shoes and highly recommend them. When these wear out~ I suspect I will replace them with an identical pair.   For sizing: they are a bit on the narrow side~ but wide enough for me. Prior to these I had the Evolv Pontas which were so narrow that my big toe would tuck under the toe next to it~ even though I only downsized a half size.   The Katanas are about 1/3"" wider than the Pontas and fit my foot just right...but if you have wide feet~ the Katana may be too narrow for you. For sizing~ I would go down one full size from your street-shoe size for comfort. 1 1/2-2 sizes for performance (you can go smaller but they are going to be punishingly tight)."
794,la-sportiva,katana,4.0,   I don't recommend going small in size!   Pros   Cons   Great shoe~ but I wanted to let people know that my personal experience with these is to NOT go smaller!!! I bought a 39.5 originally and had to get a 40.5~ my actual street shoe size! (I am actually an 8.5 or 9!)   I spent an afternoon climbing in the 39.5's two days ago and my feet STILL hurt! My big toe joints all the way up my foot were in pain~ and some old nerve pain from an old Morton's Neuroma is all fired up and hasn't been in ages!   So I just wanted to pass this info along to folks who are boggled about what size to get. Now that I have the 40.5's I feel I can actually wear them without taking them off between every single climb! :)
795,la-sportiva,katana,5.0,   The best pair of rock shoes I've ever owned!   They are extraordinarily comfortable for a pair of technical shoes~ and have performed well on a variety of surfaces~ even out performing (to my delight) my more technical shoes. I would highly recommend these to any level of climber~ for the money (they generally aren't cheap) it really is worth it.   I noticed that some reviews mention there being a problem with their durability. While I am on to my second pair of these~ the first pair lasted a good year (climbing three times a week on various surfaces) without any problems (other than the usual wear down to be expected)~ and the second pair are still going strong...   Love climbing~ hate killing your feet for it? These are the shoes for you...
796,la-sportiva,katana,1.5,"   All my Sportiva shoes have fallen apart. I have a pair of Katanas that ""perform"" very well on the rock. However~ they have delaminated terribly and require constant re-gluing to keep them from falling apart. This also happened on my Sportiva Mythos and Megas.   The resole shop that I frequent says that they get a lot of complaints about Sportiva shoes and that they have problems because they are not cleaned thoroughly before they are assembled. I no longer buy Sportiva products.   Also~ when I sent messages to Sportiva N.A. customer service~ they never responded. How bad is that?! They suck!"
797,la-sportiva,katana,5.0,   I've been climbing for 1.5 years now and own currently seven pairs of climbing shoes. This is by far the best climbing shoe I've had. It is very technical~ but very comfortable. I had a pair of Vipers before and although they had great grip~ taking them off was a pain~ whereas the Katana are easy to put on and remove~ and with the velcro you adjust how tight you want them.   I have used it indoors~ on granite and basalt~ and has always excelled! Great sport climbing shoe.   Down side? After using it 2-3 times a week~ had to resole them after three months.
798,la-sportiva,katana,4.0,   Used these shoes on granite and limestone sport and sometimes in the gym. Great edging and hooking (both toe and heel) abilities! Bought these snug (I'm a size 12 and got a 43) and they took a little breaking in~ about 2-3 wks.   Only drawback was the wear. After three months of regular use (1-2 times/wk) the toe rubber started delaminating.
799,la-sportiva,katana,5.0,   I manage an indoor rock climbing gym and just recently bought a pair of Katanas. I've owned four other brand name shoes~ but have already enjoyed these the most. The dual direction velcro makes for a great fit~ they're extremely comfortable~ they climb awesome~ and on top of all of that~ they look really cool!
800,five-ten,coyote-lace-up,4.0,   They're a good shoe. For someone who has wide feet such as myself~ they're great.    On the downside~ they're pretty cheap. The stitchings on the side has torn on mine~ and these shoes wear away pretty quickly. If you do a massive amount of edging~ you're going to wear away these shoes within 4-5 months~ perhaps 2 times a week.    They're a good beginner shoe. But once you get good enough to do some hard edging/cracking~ these shoes are gone. On the plus side~ these break in pretty quickly. 
801,five-ten,coyote-lace-up,4.0,   I have had these shoes for 3 years now and they have withheld lots of indoor and outdoor climbing. Climbing in them on an average of 4 times a week~ they have been excellent gym climbing shoes. They are very comfortable and great for beginners.     A downfall is that the heel pops off easily when doing heel hooks and the edging wears off fairly quickly. They withstood great for outdoor crack climbing and top roping. I would recommend them.
802,five-ten,coyote-lace-up,4.5,   I've had these shoes for about 5 months and they're still in good shape. They're used on average two or three times a week. The rubber is still in good shape and still sticks well. Can't really ask for much more from a shoe for this price
803,five-ten,coyote-lace-up,3.0,   I've owned these shoes for a little less than a year and they're pretty much shot. They were used on average once a week. They were good beginner shoes and they were cheap~ but you get what you pay for. The rubber wore really quickly~ especially at the toe. Before I knew it~ the whole toe (on both shoes!) was blown out and I was shredding my toe skin on the rocks. My girlfriend has the same shoes and the same thing happened to her. That's what you get for 75 bucks I guess...
804,five-ten,coyote-lace-up,4.0,   Just bought these kicks at my local EMS. I plan to use them at an indoor rock gym. I'll post more about their fit/function after the break-in period! Initially the fit is comfortable and snug. I recommend buying a half-size smaller~ as the folks at EMS told me these shoes will stretch a bit.
805,five-ten,stonelands-slipper,4.5,   A great~ comfortable~ yet stiff slipper. Great for cracks and slabs! Not for overhangs.   Pros   Cons   Back story: Well~ my La Sportiva Barracudas finally bit the dust. I searched desperately for a new crack climbing shoe~ namely~ one with rubber over the toes. To my dismay~ most shoes with rubber over the toes are aggressive and downturned~ not ideal candidates for a crack climbing shoe.   The decision came down to the Five Ten MocAssym (a favorite of many crack climbers) or the Five Ten Stonelands Slipper~ a new addition to the Five Ten family. Apart from key words like “thin crack~” “Firsten Last~” and “lined leather~” it was difficult to otherwise characterize the shoe. With no stores nearby that carried them~ I called Five Ten to get their take on sizing and then purchased the shoes.   Fit: If you climb in and enjoy the Five Ten Anasazi~ you will likely be pleased with this shoe. The major difference is in the toe box. It is boxier which allows your smaller toes to lie flat. The only toe which is bent is the big toe. The shoes fit comfortably now that they’ve been broken in. I am a street size 11/11.5~ wear my Anasazis at 10.5~ and the Stonelands at 10.5. The Stonelands are now significantly more comfortable than the Anasazis but fit well~ the goal of a crack climbing shoe.   My recommendation would be to size the Stonelands the same as your Anasazis for crack climbing applications.   Why the Stonelands over the MocAssym? Because there was more rubber over the top of the toe.   My first trip out with these shoes proved to be a success. I onsighted my first 5.11a~ Gunsoke~ in Long Canyon near Moab~ UT. This particular climb goes through a myriad of crack sizes from big hands down to fingers layback.   Performance: Sticky C4 rubber. They come with a great edge (until you wear it down). These shoes also double as a great slab climbing shoe. They stuck well until the sun came out on a 5.11a slab (Punany) in Little Cottonwood Canyon~ UT.   You will have problems with back-stepping small edges (compared to the Anasazi). But most importantly~ these shoes become socks at anything over 10 degrees overhanging. Small pockets and edges which need to be pulled in to with your feet will prove to be a difficult task. Also~ I found my feet slipping off of holds instead of staying firmly planted.   Durability: After using these for a number of months and several trips to Indian Creek~ they are indeed durable. I wanted to switch to a slipper to avoid laces and lace wear on crack climbs. These have outperformed the Barracudas by a long shot.
806,five-ten,team-vxi,4.5,   The Five Ten Team VXi’s are a highly specialized~ performance climbing shoe. If you’re at a place in your climbing where you need a little boost to crack that latest project~ these are like having a cheat code in your bag. Boosting a full 360 degrees of the Stealth Mi6 makes these shoes excel at steep or overhanging routes. I’ve got very few constructive critiques. Other than a small break-in period~ these are~ in every aspect~ a top performer.   Pros   Cons      PREAMBLE   This entire shoe is built around the incredible Stealth Mi6 rubber which Five Ten originally developed for the Mission Impossible movie series. No~ that’s not a typo. Tasked with designing a shoe that could stick to glass~ you can probably think of the scene from Ghost Protocol~ they started with their Stealth C4 rubber and had to reinvent the wheel. Softer and stickier than any rubber ever developed~ the entire idea of a climbing shoe had to be revisited.      FIT/COMFORT   As I mentioned earlier the Stealth Mi6 rubber is extremely soft and flexible. So rather than having to jam your feet into~ and wrestle with~ your shoes~ these feel more like your favourite pair of broken-in leather boots. They mould around your feet and are able to take the shape of your foot rather than the other way around.   (Look at how flexibly these fold up!)   These things weigh 10 ounces per pair! Again? 10. Oz. Per pair. Most climbing shoes (as a general average) are only slightly less than that~ per shoe. My La Sportiva Katanas weigh 8.7 oz EACH. Five Ten claims they are the lightest climbing shoes made. I’ve never taken the time to compare them to every other shoe on the market but I’d believe it. This just adds to the feeling that your are climbing with nothing on.   I can’t say I’ve ever noticed any other pair of climbing shoes' weight being a hinderance~ but I also can’t say I’ve ever not noticed a shoe's weight as much. Especially when you are climbing outdoors it’s a surprising (hippy statement to follow) feeling of being connected to the rock. Every tiny jut or edge in the rock can be felt. It leads to a much more aware style of climbing as it can be~ if you're not paying attention to foot placement~ painful. Similar to hiking in minimalist shoes where you feel all the pebbles. But~ vertical pebbles.   The stitching in the heel cup is aggravating at first~ but nothing a few bandaids won't hide while your sweat softens it up.   (Stitching and pull tab can create hot spots at first)   The shoe only has one Velcro strap over the foot. It doesn’t really need it though (for me~ anyway) as it fits more like a slipper. Nice to have it I guess~ but I’d be fine without it as well. That's more a case of it just fitting me perfectly.      The heel cup is shallow~ but I have tiny~ ladies heels so it’s still a little too big for me. I’m definitely in the minority and think most will say it fits nice. It's not overly floppy on me~ and doesn’t affect heel hooking or anything.      PERFORMANCE   As I’ve mention ad nauseam~ the rubber used here outperforms anything you’ve ever used. The Stealth Mi6 rubber used is incredible and luckily Five Ten was smart enough to just cover this shoe with it~ 3.5 mm of it. It’s hard to write an entire review on a type of rubber but it’s really that impressive. Having the rubber extend up over the toe makes this thing excel on toe hooking~ probably the closest you’ll ever feel to Spiderman. You just have to blindly swing your foot at a hold and it sticks. No more technique. Technique is for suckers. Heel hooking’s the same. The rubber comes up a generous amount~ almost just below your achilles. Place any of that space on even the most polished indoor “rock” and it holds.    (The whole top of your foot is covered in this glorious stuff)   The Teams have a moderate downturned shape~ not enough to be painful for long sessions~ but enough to aid in performance. The thing that is different about these is that you can literally pull yourself in from the toes. It changes the way you climb as this is not a normal option on most shoes. Most shoes edge by providing a stiff platform (sole~ mid-sole) to stand on~ these you can almost hold with your toes. It takes some getting used to at first with these~ and it will work muscles in your feet you didn’t know you had~ but it’s game changing.    Having the stickiness of the rubber aids in the smearing ability as well. Most downturned shoes can’t smear very well~ but these are above average because they will bend and allow you to make full contact between the rubber and the rock (also side note—that would be a cool name for a route~ if I ever get to name my own route that’s gonna be it~ copyrighted) (someone please tell me if that’s already been taken).   (I'd call it a moderate downturn with a performance toe)   (Hard to tell here~ as hard to get a good photo while climbing...and in a tunnel climb....but rather than edging the foot and toes wrap around holds.)   (Having the flexible sole allows you to smear almost any hold~ even ones that you wouldn't traditionally.)   These things excel when you’ve topped out. Like~ physically. Not the top of a route. Between the price of them and the way I’ve fit them I just don’t use them as my beaters. If I’m working on a problem repeatedly I just don’t want to destroy these. They are not an everyday~ every climb shoe to me. I like to work on a climb in my more comfortable~ but far less performance Scarpa Force X’s~ and then when you’ve found that crux move that you just can’t stick~ bring out the big guns. More often than not they’ll stick the move and keep you going.   (They usually sit on my harness until I'm ready to expose my secret weapon.)   While they will cram in nicely and aid you in any crack climbing you will certainly feel it. The tradeoff for that flexibility and sensitivity is that you’ll feel everything. So while in some shoes you have a firm buffer between your feet and the rock in these~ it can get a little painful. It does~ however~ allow you to cram them into tighter spaces.   Side~ petty note—because everything sticks to this rubber~ I’ve never seen a shoe that gets so dirty~ so quickly. If you’re out bouldering and walking around between problems~ the soles become dirty~ quickly. More than just a cosmetic thing it can greatly affect the performance if you don’t thoroughly clean them before climbing.   SIZING   How performance do you want to go? I went down from my normal shoe size 11 to a size 10.5. I would’t recommend going anymore than that. They were tight at first~ really tight~ but they’ve loosened up a bit. I’m not sure they’ve even stretched a half size~ but they certainly feel like they have a little more give to them. They fit me perfectly now. Tight~ but not painfully so. I’d say it took around 8-10 hours of wearing them to do so.    One other note on fit. I lent them to a friend to climb who has wider~ but smaller length feet~ and he was unable to climb in them. So a caution to try them on before buying if you have wider feet~ mine are skinny and they fit great.   Unrelated to sizing (but I didn’t know where to put it)~ these things stink. This is not a problem unique to the VXi’s~ or Five Ten even~ but these reek. My fault~ I know~ but I’ve found a natural leather upper will stink “less”~ and no~ I’m not gonna wear socks with them—don’t be that guy. They are about average in terms of breathability~ but I’m not sure I’ve ever found a shoe that my foot doesn’t sweat in.      CONCLUSION   Any flaws that this shoe has is masked by the rubber. The smearing and edging shouldn’t be great~ but it is. The weakest part of this shoe is my feet. I generally keep two pairs of climbing shoes at any given time—a comfort~ beater pair (the Scarpa Force X’s~ they look like they’ve been through the ringer) and a performance pair (previously the La Sportiva Katana Lace~ wonderful shoe~ probably my…..second favourite ever)~ these will be one of them.      CONDITIONS/TESTING   I’ve used these shoes for four months of climbing and bouldering. The Niagara escarpment I climb on is primarily magnesium rich limestone (dolostone) and shale.  I’ve found the rubber to be relatively durable. You do trade a small amount of longevity for the softer rubber~ but nothing abnormal. Aside from going from an awesome neon green to a more vomit green the rubber is still functional and looks to have seasons left in it. Aside from becoming dirty easily (I’m still waiting on the self-cleaning sole) and slight~ initial break-in~ I don’t know how I can give these anything but a glowing 4.5 stars.      My thanks to Trailspace and Five Ten for the opportunity to test the Team VXi’s.
807,five-ten,newton,3.5,   Comfortable and decent performance   Pros   Cons   Not a real aggressive shoe~ but comfortable enough to make standing around not a painful experience. I like the heavier sole at the front; provides decent support when going straight in~ and good for edging. The only climbing shoe I've found that doesn't torture my frostbitten toes.   The 's' lacing lets you get a real nice fit all the way down~ and allows compensation for a higher arch or a wider foot. I've always liked  Five Ten's rubber~ and this is no exception. The smearing isn't great~ but it works well enough on most surfaces.   Like the previous poster~ I had to go a size large! Tried an 11~ my usual street size~ and had to bump up to a size 12.
808,five-ten,newton,5.0,   A very nice shoe for all but the most radical climbs! They are primarily great edging shoes~ yet they do not have the toe-down~ radical shape that you see in shoes designed for the most modern sport climbs.   They fit my feet really well. They are not so uncomfortable that I can't wear them for longer climbs. The chisel toe works well in thin cracks and pockets. Five Ten Stealth C4 rubber is simply the best. These puppies stick to everything well. I climb primarily trad style up to 5.11 or so - usually on granite and schist (New England). These have become my trusted partners on all my harder climbs except smearing slabs. I have also used them indoors and for bouldering. They really do edge extremely well. They make standing around on dime edges a much more tenable proposition.   They offer decent sensitivity but are certainly not world-class in that department. I feel that sensitivity has improved with break-in; or it could be that I'm just now totally used to them and feel confident in them.    The upper is made from a faux leather that Five Ten calls 'Cowdura'. This is great in that it has good feel and doesn't stretch.    Sizing: my street shoe size is 8.5. My Newtons are a size 9. I was surprised at this. Usually I have to size down from my street shoe size. 
809,five-ten,jet7,5.0,   I will agree with other reviews that these shoes are not very comfortable~ but you can't beat the performance.  The fact that you don't have to lace them up is a huge bonus~ and the downturned toe makes footwork a breeze.  Rad shoes for anyone who like to boulder hard on steep rock.    The toe is definitely the best part of these shoes by the way. Size of feet doesn't matter. The heel on these shoes however does not fit me very well~ but then again~ I have never had a climbing shoe that does.     Overall~ a bomb shoe for bouldering...
810,five-ten,jet7,3.5,   I just recently bought these shoes. The shoes I had before these were the evolv Talons. Both are good shoes.    The Jet Sevens have a stiff soles and the rubber is harder. They are really uncomfortable~ my toes bleed by the end of the day~ but that's because I usually wear a 12 in climbing shoes~ and I got a 10.5 in these.    They're great shoes~ but there are some downsides to them. The evolvs are a better shoe in my opinion if you're looking to do some serious climbing. The Jet Sevens are a great outdoor shoe though. 
811,scarpa,rockette,4.0,   These are the most aggressive and downturned shoes I've tried. Best for overhung sport and bouldering definitely not for comfort or to use on easier routes. The toebox is super tight with added stability but is painful. Sizing runs small I got a 35 in these (34 in La Sportiva/5.10). Rubber is very sticky with great edging.    Pros   Cons   I was deciding between these and La Sportiva Miuras when trying to find a more aggressive shoe and ended up getting these because of the price (these were on sale).   They are great for edging onto tiny stuff and the rubber is super sticky~ the toebox is a bit painful after wearing them even for just one pitch~ the heel is a bit loose on me but tighter than my previous La Sportivas. Size runs 1-2 sizes smaller than in my La Sportivas (34)~ I got these in a 35.   I've worn them climbing about 3 times a week for the last 3 weeks and they haven't broken in too much since they are almost entirely covered in rubber. The extra rubber coverage makes them great for toe hooks and flagging/smearing in all directions.   They are great for really hard sport routes~ but painful toes is the price you pay for these since they will take a long time to break in.
812,mad-rock,demon,3.5,   This is an amazing shoe! For the price you can't beat it with a stick. Comfortable~ aggressive~ breathable~ and sticky~ what else can you ask for.    Pros   Cons   The fit of the Mad Rock Demons is customizable by the three velcro strap system. When first purchased they are tight like most rock climbing shoe but these don't stretch out as much as some aggressive climbing shoes do. The aggressive down turned shoe fits most arch types but I'd be weary if I had a flat foot.    Personally~ I have a skinny foot but knowing a few friends that have the same shoe who have medium to large feet~ we have all agreed that the fit molds to your foot. When it come to comfort~ it seems all climbing shoes are stiff when first out of the package~ but the Mad Rock Demons only took a couple good days of climbing to break in.  With an added benefit of no pressure points~ chaffing~ or tightness around the ankle~ this shoe is easy to break in.    The rubber is amazing!  Sticky~ clean~ soft enough to dig in on the tiniest crystal but tough enough to last~ including a heel cap with specific ridges for heel hooks~ the Mad Rock Demons are top notch.  They do have specifically designed ridges on the top toe cap for toe hooks but I have noticed some hindrances on specific problems.    I have been climbing in the Demons for four months now and have little complaints.  I will be very specific in my complaints.   Cons
813,mad-rock,demon,3.5,"   i love shoes that are soft and not down turned at all. then this version of the demon comes out and destroys my world! at first glance i was already forming opinions about it. ""another aggressive shoe that will just sit in my bag and only be used 1 or 2 times and then put back in the bag till the next climbing trip.""   when i slid them on and i heard the suction cup sound when my heel slid into place.. in my head all i hear is ""crap~ i'm going to like them""   first off the rubber is slightly softer then the first version of the demon. the power upper combined with the sole of the shoe forces your toes in optimal position. no more are the days of your toes curling up into a little ball at the front of your foot causing agonizing pain when you step on small or large feet.   the velcro straps keep your foot firmly in place and your foot doesn't shift around.   the heel its pretty nice. it may be different for you but when my heel locked in place it didn't move at all. so far the heel hasn't begun to peel off my foot while climbing in pulling myself in with heel hooks."
814,climb-x,rave,3.5,   This climbing shoe is a great shoe for beginner to intermediate climbers. It is a good shoe that has lasted me months of climbing at Grand Ledge~ MI. It is very cheap for a climbing shoe but do not overlook this shoe due to its price. For the price it is very durable and effective.   Pros   Cons   This shoe~ although cheap~ has stood up to months of grueling bouldering and climbing. I again say: DO NOT LOOK OVER THIS SHOE DUE TO ITS INEXPENSIVE PRICE.    Yes~ I will agree that a Scarpa or LaSportiva shoe would most likely hold up longer. With saying this~ I am a college student and do not have a lot of money. This shoe is for those of you who do not wish to shell out a couple hundred bucks just to climb up some rocks.   The features I listed above such as the hemp foot bed and the ankle cushion have done their duty on a consistent basis to keep my feet feeling and smelling good. (Or as good as it gets after a day of climbing). The sole has not yet worn out on me as many cheaper brand shoes do and that was a positive surprise to me!   Like I have said~ I climb at a gym in Kalamazoo as well as ‘The Ledges’ in Grand Ledge~ Michigan. The shoes have held up and worked well at both of these places and I see myself buying another pair of Climb X shoes once these ones are forced to retire!   Good shoe for a better price!
815,la-sportiva,venom,5.0,   This shoe is amazing. It fits my foot like a glove and is crazy sticky. One real bonus for me is the mesh the shoe has on the top. That rubber makes toe hooking so much more a secure task. Great brand~ great shoe. 
816,la-sportiva,venom,5.0,   I absolutely love this shoe! The grip this shoe gives on every hold is incredible~ and right after purchasing this shoe~ I completed an overhang route that I had been attempting without success for awhile in my Mad Rocks. I love them~ 5 out of 5!
817,la-sportiva,venom,5.0,   LOVE THEM. My last pair was Anasazi women's~ which are a great shoe...but once I got used to edging with them and heel hooking and once they broke in I absolutely love them...every time I go for those big outstretched moves and release my core by accident the shoe keeps on stickin...It feels like cheating~ and though they are primarily for sport and bouldering they're totally fine on vertical crimping routes. They edge great and they're super sensitive.
818,la-sportiva,venom,5.0,   Before my Venoms~ I used an excellent pair of La Sportiva Cobras for a couple of years till they wore out. I happened to stumble across the Venoms on sale when I was looking for a replacement pair of Cobras and debated about whether to stick with something tried and trusted or to take a chance. In the end~ I went for the Venoms as they were a newer~ slightly more aggressive design and only 10 Euros more.   Whilst it's hard to compare a new shoe with an old worn one~ I have to say that I was very impressed with the Venoms. A good snug fit~ very sensitive to what's under them and very sticky (obvious~ I know~ as they were new). They're just as easy to get on and off as the Cobras but I found one of the key differences was the lack of stretch~ especially over the toes/top of foot where the extra rubber layer keeps them tight. They're great for the gym and short climbs but I generally swap them for a pair of sandals when not climbing so probably wouldn't be ideal for long days.
819,la-sportiva,barracuda,5.0,   Ok~ right out of the box~ they performed great! If you fit these well~ they fit like a glove. Light weight~ really nice toe pointing~ rubber sticks very well~ edge on a dime and pull it too~ good purchase on overhangs~ nice heel hooking on extremes.    I've been climbing in Boreal Lasers (the first ones) and 5.10 Moccasyms for 15 years and the Sportiva Barracuda is just as good for all around high performance climbing.  and for bouldering they can handle v-9 and more...but is that really the shoe (Well~ I guess~ a little~ lol).     Watch the sizing. I'm 42.5~ 43 and had to take a 40 for a perfect fit. Happy Climbing.
820,la-sportiva,barracuda,5.0,   I just started using this shoe and right away I liked it. I rated as high as the Katana~ although this one is a lace up~ and has rubber on the top to jam better in cracks. It is very technical~ great edging~ so can be used both in cracks and face climbs. Out of the 7 pair of shoes that I own~ this one is on the top two.
821,la-sportiva,barracuda,5.0,   I've recently started climbing - both bouldering and traditional climbs in Colorado. I have to tell you~ the Barracuda is great. It is an amazing fit due to the lace pattern and the rubber mesh over the toe-box.
822,scarpa,marathon,5.0,   These shoes are comfy with a cushioned tongue and are stiff and are great for edging. The stitching is solid and the shoes are holding up well. I mostly gym climb but have used them on sandstone and they did great on both.
823,scarpa,marathon,5.0,   These shoes are perfect if you are looking for a versatile shoe. I have climbed sandstone cracks in Indian Creek and sporty granite faces in Rocky Mountain and they performed very well.    I mainly bought these to have a comfy pair of shoes to trad climb in. They easily get the job done and the laces are much more secure when jamming a crack than the Five Ten Ascents that have velcro straps. The edging is great and the smearing capability is fine. I notice a slight difference in friction with the Scarpa rubber (I think it's vibram) compared to Five Ten's stealth rubber. When I resole them with stealth~ they will be unbeatable. They are unlined~ but probably won't stretch more than half a size unless you buy them really tight.    If you are looking for a great all-around comfy trad shoe definitely buy these.    
824,evolv,optimus-prime,5.0,   Great shoe. I ending up buying this the same size as my old Defys and it fits well. Very minimal stretch as you would expect from a synthetic shoe with a liner. As far as the smell goes its tons better with this shoe then my old Defys about par with my leather shoes.   This shoes is what I would called semi-aggressive. Were it is down turned its not so extreme as to make it impossible to climb vertical problems easily or smearing when necessary. This can be a problem with some more aggressive shoes Ive owned like the Evolv Predator/Talon or the Scarpa Boosters for example.   About the only downside I can really see with the shoe is that because of the symmetrical toe (rounded) as opposed to a typical asymmetrical (pointed) toe is the lack of ability to get into smaller pockets.    Other then that I can't complain. It's comfortable enough for all day sessions and yet still aggressive enough to hammer out that cave problem.
825,evolv,optimus-prime,5.0,   Awesome shoes just brilliant. True craftmanship on Sharma's part.
826,five-ten,piton,5.0,   Very satisfied with this shoe. My only complaint is that the rubber on the side edges of the toe box loses its sharp edge and becomes rounded fairly quickly. It's only a small complaint though because the shoe continues to be superior. The new stealth onyx rubber is super tacky~ much more so than the soles of my friends La Sportivas.  I highly recommend this shoe for someone who has a squared off toe box: meaning the tip of your big toe is not much further in front of the tip of your pinky toe.  
827,five-ten,piton,4.0,   So much rubber! The pitons are built for crack climbing~ and their stiff sole is great for long climbs and many hours spent on the rock. Similar to the Ascent~ these have a bit of cushion under the heel for walk-offs or ballett. The toebox is fairly large and is best suited for a higher-volume~ wider foot. After two weeks in Indian Creek~ I was convinced these are my favorite all-around trad shoes.    Honestly~ I couldn't tell the difference between the new Onyx rubber and the standard C4. The Pitons still hold up for steep face climbing and smear well on slabby chickens or frothy gravel. The shoes run big...I bought them a full size down from my street shoe to get a proper fit. Consider that these are not high performace face climbing shoes~ so don't size them too tight! If not for the somewhat selective fit~ these shoes would get 5 stars.
828,la-sportiva,mantis,5.0,   These are fantastic value~ they are firmly in the low end of the price range for climbing shoes~ but the quality and fit is excellent. The velcro straps are nice to have instead of laces~ allowing for a quick fit or removal when belaying. The padded tongue and soft leather is very comfortable to wear~ in fact I generally forget to remove them when I am taking a break from climbing.   It's funny to compare with friends who can never stop thinking about their feet because of the painful fit of their shoes. My Mantis' are a few sizes small for me~ but don't cause me any undue comfort. OK they're not exactly down booties~ but for climbing shoes these are genuinely comfy.   The rand is nice and high~ and the vibram soles are sticky as hell~ they smear well and the toe has a nice aggressive slant to it.   So I have to give them five stars~ for the price~ they really offer excellent value. Not the prettiest shoes on the market~ but that's one area I don't really bother about.
829,montrail,method,5.0,   The rubber is as sticky as C4 or Onyx~ although softer (might wear faster?). The fit is comfortable~ no hot spots that I've felt. The plant is medium-wide~ fits the foot very nicely~ but might constrict exceptionally wide plants. The edging is superior~ reminiscent of the Galileo~ but with quite a lot of sensitivity. Extremely aggressive asym foot puts a *ton* of power in the toe. It's unreal.     The leather takes a little bit of break-in~ but the interior has the CTX foam. Stick 'em in an oven for two minutes~ put them on~ and they mold to your feet. Very~ very~ very comfortable shoes~ especially for being two full sizes smaller than street. In fact~ I might've been able to go a 1/2 size smaller.    In summation: my favorite shoes to date~ and they seem to work well as all-around shoes~ as well (or better) than my 5.10 Galileos. I would recommend them to an intermediate to advanced climber that has some foot strength~ and is looking for an aggressive~ super-sticky climbing shoe. Me~ I don't leave home without 'em.
830,montrail,cruiser,3.0,   I've used this shoe for 2 years.   This shoe has the following flaws:   - The sole separates from the rand soon after the first uses where you edge (toe/side)~ compromising it's edging and durability. A true design flaw~ because I had a few pairs and all did that. I actually returned my 1st pair to Montrail for replacement when it was recent product. The replacement pair did the same soon after~ but I used it 'till it fully tore down because in trad climbing I don't need a technical shoe. The ones I got on sale do it too now and I'm trying to save them with glue... Doesn't work too good~ but $28.45 (at sierra trading post)!   - The heel strap and clip are useless and get in the way.   - The shoe is discontinued~ so don't get too used to it. Now Montrail offers shoes with thermo-molding for extra comfort. Yet they don't seem to be able to break into the climbing shoe market.   - The toes are not curled~ so you face climbers~ it's not the best for you. The sole is flat~ so not best for bouldering either. Also~ it's lace-ups~ not velcro or slipper for quick change.   And the following qualities:   - It's MSRP is cheaper than the top brands like 5.10~ Sportiva...   - It's comfortable.   - It's a decent all around shoe~ though not the best for beginners I think because of the sole flaw.
831,montrail,cruiser,5.0,   This is a great shoe that I would recommend to just about anybody that is looking for a solid shoe that is going to take a beating. This shoe has an awesome sole with incredible grip. Along with being incredibly durable I was very surprised the first time I put these shoes on because they were very comfortable. With my old shoes I would do a route and then come down and pull my heel out of the shoe.    As far as being a technical shoe I don't know if I can really comment. I would consider myself to be a beginner climber even though I  have been climbing for about 2 years now and now on my second pair of shoes. I will say that I find it pretty easy to stick my toe in any hole. I think these are great shoes for the price and would recommend them to anyone.
832,montrail,cruiser,4.0,   These are not a beginner shoe though a beginner can use them. And you don't always need to climb with toes curled!   It is very comfortable~ and perfect for crack climbing and walks offs. It is decent for face~ though for plastic crimp-climbing you'll prefer slippers or Anassazi's -with toes curled- and for bouldering some extreme arch shoes. And BTW~ I used these shoes on plastic on up to 12b's~ so they work there too. I stopped cuz I realized I was wasting them and later saved them for outdoors granite.   The griptonite rubber is very-very decent in terms of grip - not bad compared to C4~ much better than lame vibram soles.   Cons:   This shoe is not produced any more - unfortunately. It has some minor flaws: the sole unglues at the tip after a few uses at the rand seam~ and looses some of its edging. The back strap is useless ans should be cut off~ the snap sometimes opens when doing crack and can be a bother. The leather will tear at the topmost lace towards end of life~ and cracks will tear holes in the leather sides (I put cement on rubbing parts now to protect). That means when the sole's done~ the shoe will be evenly worn - not worth resoling.   Pros:   The laces are easy to handle~ and do not tear in cracks after use (many shoes wear through laces!). They're comfortable yet the feet do not roll inside. The tip is not as thin as other preferred crack shoes~ but very acceptable. The sole is not boardlasted but not too mushy either so they do slabs. The rubber's great. Better than my Huecos.   My 1st pair I kept so long and beat up people were willing to pay me to not see them anymore :D   BTW I also bugged Montrail support and they were great and very helpful. Good company~ support them!
833,montrail,cruiser,5.0,   These shoes were my first (I'm on my third pair). The low price and comfort probably allowed me to get pretty far as a beginner climber in a short amount of time. I wore them 5+ times a week all summer. Because of how well they fit~ I will actually get them resoled and keep them around as my second pair.   I don't think that the point-your-toes-downward type of shoe is requisite for climbing~ contrary to the previous reviewer (neither does my climbing partner~ who's been climbing for 30 yrs). My second pair was the point-your-toes down kind~ which didn't work for me. I got a third pair~ while I await my Montrail Cruisers to get resoled.   The rands on mine wore out quickly~ though I think that is a function of a specific crag that I was working on over and over~ and not design flaw or toe drag. I found the soles lost their stickiness pretty soon (though I was putting a lot of milage in a short time on them)... nothing that I good scrubbing w/a wire brush couldn't restore. There isn't a bad stretch factor~ like there usually are w/velcro and slipper styles. I don't think the buckle/achilles strap thing does anything. They aren't the best edgers (compared w/my Mad Rock Phoenix).   For the money~ I am really happy w/these shoes. They will definitely be resoled multiple times and be kept in use.   
834,montrail,cruiser,3.0,   The Cruiser: a beginner shoe which condemns you to being a beginner for as long as they last. This shoe is supposedly all about comfort~ but their philosophy in constructing this shoe contradicts one of the most important guidelines for climbing shoes: wear them tight~ with your toes curled. The toe box is round and stubby~ making it large and awkward when edging~ and useless for pockets. And the cinch heel feature isn't necessary at all.    I bought them small~ and they are just as uncomfortable as the next tight climbing shoe even without cinching the heel. You should not buy these shoes if you plan to curl your toes and wear them tight.    Okay~ redeeming this shoe is a good supportive sole~ which keeps your feet from getting sore. Secondly the rubber is very strong~ so I've been climbing hard for 7 months in these with little wear.    Think about it this way: you want expensive climbing shoes to last a year or more~ right? But in a year~ don't you want to be doing hard routes? Buy some shoes that aren't necessarily technical~ but that will give you some toe precision so that there's some room to grow.
835,la-sportiva,cliff,3.5,   Good overall shoe. This was my first climbing shoe. I enjoy the lace-up style as it allows me to learn just how tight I need to make them for overall performance. I am a very novice climber but so far I don't have too many complaints about what La Sportiva has done with this shoe.   Pros   Cons   The shoe fits my foot very well. I am new to climbing so I was looking for a decent all around type of shoe that I could do bouldering with as well as climbing.   I am a fan of the lace-up style while learning how my foot is supposed to perform while climbing. I can experience the differences by adjusting the laces that otherwise I would have to try a different shoe to accomplish.
836,la-sportiva,cliff,4.5,   Great shoe with a great fit~ this shoe is very comfortable. After about the first half of the year some of the rubber came off the sides but it was no big problem. The toe isn't the greatest and is not super narrow. Overall it is a great shoe an very comfy.
837,la-sportiva,cliff,3.0,   Overall a very nice shoe. First shoe I bought and it's served me well in the last year. I'm now climbing 5.10+ indoor and outdoor (including longish trad climbs). Decent edging and smearing.     Unfortunately the sole started delaminating after only a few months of use. I've seen this happen with other people's Cliffs too. And the toe on one of my shoes has worn through.    Overall a good shoe for the money but hopefully they'll fix the quality control on the sole.
838,la-sportiva,cliff,4.0,   Very comfortable shoe. Unlined leather with quick break-in. Stiff toe and laces to the toebox make for good crack climbing.
839,montrail,zealot,4.0,   It's taken me about 6 months to properly break in this shoe. I purchased it a half size smaller than my normal climbing shoes~ and although now it's fine~ these shoes literally brought tears to my eyes on an easy sport route. I always brought backups to the gym~ and wore these on a problem or two before changing into more comfortable shoes. Then one day~ low and behold~ they became the Best Climbing Shoes!!!    The shoes finally molded to my foot~ I developed the proper upper toe calluses~ and learned to really power moves with the big toe. I now love these shoes~ but they are still difficult to get on and off~ and must be removed now and again between problems to avoid the dreaded arch cramp.  
840,montrail,zealot,4.0,   This shoe is sticky. It makes a terrible climber like me stay on the wall long enough to grab the next hold. I wouldn't call them comfortable because no climbing shoe is~ but it's great for short sport and gym workouts. 
841,montrail,zealot,4.0,   I got it for real cheap through some European company~ but I love this shoe. You do have to wear it A LOT to get it somewhat confortable. The smearing on this shoe is amazing. The heel is sick for heel hooks and the shoe focuses your power to the smallets spots on your feet.     The negatives.... the shoe does come apart after a while if you are an advid climber. I climbing on it 6-7 times a week and the rubber in the front is de-laminating. I have added some super glue~ haha~ for time being and it helps. I am just doing this to hold me over a month until I buy a new pair.
842,mad-rock,mugen,4.0,   These were my first pair of climbing shoes...from the moment I opened the box~ the crisp clean smell of new shoes hit my nose... originally I thought I purchased the shoes too small. I got them in my street size (10) and my toes were curled back~ after further research I've learned this is ok with with climbing shoes. They were super sticky but I've gone an worn a hole completely through them (my fault) but I do feel the rubber did give away a little fast. I am considering possibly purchasing another pair since they did feel so great. but I will likely resole them another brands rubber....all in all a great first shoe~ doesn't stretch very much...enjoy!
843,mad-rock,mugen,4.0,   New Mugen... where to start... I opened that package~ and that new shoe smell flooded my senses... never get tired of it.   Then comes the sight... the look~ rad in design~ and sure to catch a few glances. Bright White~ with its red logo~ strikes you. The ergonomics of it are definitely different than your average shoe~ with the new heel design~ and pointed toe.   The dual density sole is a godsend in my case. The tight~ lip makes for great stability on Jibs~ and the softer inside still gives you some feel of the rock. Velcro stays on like pro~ and doesn't rub off on the wall or rocks~ and the mid section of the shoe with it's overlapping design will fit anyone's top foot.     That said~ the toe and heel take getting used to. These shoes are smaller than most you've climbed in by about a half a size. I'd try them on before buying to make sure you've got the right size.   Overall~ the rubber sticks very well~ albeit it comes off on the wall a little easier than I would of liked.     If you want style and flair~ you've got it~ performance is par with most other shoes~ and the innovations of the dual Rand~ heel hook~ lined inside... are either a love 'em or hate 'em.
844,mad-rock,loco,4.0,   i've had my Locos for about a month and I love them. I did not however think that when I first bought them. My other rock shoes were a 7 US~ and I found that even a 9 in the Locos were really tight. After about two or three weeks of climbing in a gym and outside they started to loosen~ but not much.    They're great for dime size edging and steep overhangs. If you do more than a small amount of slabbing stay away. They will eat your feet up if you're not careful. Great for short sport routes or in a gym. You'll be screamin' if you have a long multipitch route. So if you're pushing the numbers Locos are great...if you can get past the break-in period.
845,mad-rock,loco,4.0,   These shoes climb steep limestone like a spider~ but will destroy your feet. After trying on several sizes at a shoe demo~ I found my street size worked best. I am able to stand on the smallest of bumps as long as I can put up with the pain. For those pushing the grades~ I recommend Locos. For rec climbers that stay closer to vertical~ don't get 'em. Drawbacks are the break-in period is long and the velcro will delaminate from the backing in hot weather.
846,five-ten,ascent,4.0,   Pros   Cons   Gauranteed~ any shoe that is made by Five Ten I will stand by. Their products are solid and worth their value. I have narrow feet and can tell that Five Ten shoe fits really well for my foot..but that all depends on your feet measurements and sizes...buy a pair.
847,five-ten,ascent,4.0,"   I purchased this pair of shoes roughly four years ago and use them esclusively on long trad routes. The EVO sole cushions impact on descents and boudering~ but for me it serves its purpose hanging out on belay ledges. They smear on both low and high angle friction like a dream as the C4 rubber is just amazing.    I wanted to size them a 1/2 size larger to accomodate the digets~ knowing full well that the purpose for these shoes was of the ""all day"" nature. I feel~ despite my decision for comfort~ that I lost little to no performance. They edge nicely~ though not quite as good as their counter part the VCS or Galileo~ but sufficient for what I climb with them.    The velcro makes them great for easy on easy off changovers and the sensitivity rivals that of the Moccasym. Some find the split padded tongue a hinderance~ and I have even heard it said that it makes the shoe a bit sloppy and hot. I have found neither to be true~ but certainly any time you add padding to a shoe~ some compromises will have to be made. This is a great intermediate~ to advanced intermediate shoe and can't be beat on the epic journey on stone we often take!"
848,five-ten,anasazi-slipper,4.0,   I got my pair free so I didn't expect much from it. At the time I owned a pair of Anasazi Velcro Onyx. The first thing I noticed when I put these on were that the toe area was more narrow and sharp compared to the velcros.   The heel was quite baggy which is probably because I have a narrow heel.   Besides the bagginess~ this shoe is probably one of the best shoes I've had so far. I've had quite a few including the Red Chili X-cube~ Miuras and Anasazi Velcros.    I found the C4 rubber was actually sticker and more durable that the onyx rubber on my velcros.   I mainly use these for bouldering. Whenever I do roof problems where the heel is required I switch to the Miuras as the heel fits me a bit better.   I wear size 37EUR in the Miuras which is super painful but have these in 7US which are quite tight but no longer painful.   After 6 months with them the elastic on top has gotten bit loose but besides that~ the rubber is great and durable (I still have a sharp inner edge on my shoe).
849,montrail,magnet,4.0,   Great shoe for the price. I sized these the same as my street shoes~ but would recommend sizing 0.5 to 1 full European shoe size smaller as the shoes do stretch a bit. The toe box fits wider than the Scarpa and Sportiva designs~ which for me is more comfortable.   The rubber is good and sticky~ and the moldable foam is quite comfortable and does make the footbed feel reasonably secure~ but at the trade-off of decreased sensitivity. The rubber thickness in the toe is fairly thick which is a bonus for increased lifespan~ but again~ at the cost of decreased sensitivity.     Generous rubber in the heel makes hooking reasonably secure and comfortable. Be skeptical of people who say the rubber doesn't last...I think it's because they have bad technique. Complaints I have heard about these shoes wearing down fast have generally been from new climbers with these being their first or second pair of shoes. The rubber is soft and sticky~ which means it will not hold up well to newbie and/or sloppy foot-scraping technique.     I have worn these shoes in the gym for 6 months now climbing mostly mid 5.11's and V4 problems~ for between 2-3 times climbing per week and the shoes show an average level of wear. This is typical of at least 4 others in the gym with the same shoes~ climbing ability and climbing frequency.   The artificial uppers don't breathe very well~ and can make your feet get quite sweaty~ which~ if the shoe is not snug~ will make your foot slip a bit more on very small holds.
850,mad-rock,hooker-lace,1.0,   These shows are terrible. I cannot disagree more with the other two reviews.     I tried a pair 1/2 size down from my shoe size. Impossible~ not uncomfortable~ just NOT POSSIBLE to get onto my foot. After sizing up twice~ and ending 1/2 over my shoe size~ still incredibly hard to get on and unbearable to wear. I even sat in the shower a few times with them on to try to stretch them...    I've had tight shoes~ these are beyond tight. I gave these to a friend~ woman~ who has a size 7 women's~ I wear a size 8.5 men's. They are very tight on her but apparently usable~ for free anyway. I have a lower volume foot~ nothing fltt or chubby.  FYI.     Further~ the revolutionary toe ribbing can present some uncomfortable feelings in the foot~ not sure why they came up with this~ do you see anyone else making some a cracked out shoe? Successfully?     Mad Rock is now dumping the rest of the shoes on their outlet site for 19$~ if the rest of this is not warning enough. Don't buy these things really~ lame.  I have found several other pairs of shoes that are reasonable for under 100$~ these are not in that category.
851,mad-rock,hooker-lace,4.0,   Great design~ easy in and out with three straps. The toe of the shoe is mint~ and even more so when broken in a little. I wear a normal shoe size of 13~ so I ordered a 13 hooker strap. They were a little uncomfortable to stand in at first~ but after the second day out my toes made new homes for themselves.
852,mad-rock,hooker-lace,5.0,   I have owned several shoes and this pair has been my favorite. They are like socks with really sticky rubber. They just form to your foot and stick to anything. The rubber~ however~ does wear out really fast.
853,evolv,pontas,2.0,"   I currently own a pair of Evolv Pontas size 11— part of the Sharma signature range. These shoes are a great all rounder.       I purchased a second pair recently online (same size 11). I could not squeeze these shoes onto my feet~ so I returned them and purchased a pair of size 12s. The size twelve was also way too tight so I returned these also at a total cost of €50—ouch!!       My advice is: ""do not buy Evolv shoes online. Be sure to try the shoes on in a shop first. The company has serious issues with sizing!""   Pros   Cons   Evolv has a major problem with sizing. Do not purchase online unless you are willing to spend a lot of money on returns!"
854,evolv,pontas,4.0,   i tried this shoe out and the optimus prime. i wear a street 13 and bought these in a 12. good toe knuckles when i tried them but the opimus prime had a smaller more aggressive heel~ while the toe pinched. i bought the pontas~ after about 30 climbs in 3 days i noticed dead space in the heel. i'm slightly disappointed. one of my friends complained of the same thing.    overall a good shoe~ i plan on ordering a 11.5 in a bit to see if that closes up the dead heel space.
855,evolv,pontas,4.5,   Very versatile and sensitive. It has a 3/4 length semi stiff midsole which softens a bit and flexes. Put that together with the asymmetrical (pointed toe) profile and you get a good blend of edge and pushability with good sensitivity.     It isn't necessarily a powerful edging shoe. I tend to blow off of small holds in vertical high tension liebacks and oppositions~ but I can always find the sweet spot on any little foot chip. For average to delicate footwork edging~ smearing and toe pointing they excel.     To compare them to other shoes~ they edge as well as the La Sportiva Viper and almost as well as the La Sportiva Katana or 5-10 Anasazi vcs~ but that is combined with a toe that is just as sensitive as the La Sportiva Venom and the Cobra. If you are climbing a route that you would break out your Muras or Anasazi laceups for than this might be a little soft~  but that is where the Pontas Lace comes in.   The heel is snug side to side and fairly snug at the rand. Really a moderately to mildly aggressive heel rand~ comfy but keeps tension. If you have always found dead space behind your heel in Five Ten or Sportiva~ then evolv is for you.     In the Pontas you may find a little space behind the bottom of your heel~ but above that bottom corner it sits close to the back of your heel all the way up (incidentally the Pontas Lace fits the heel a little more snugly~ especially at the base of the heel).  With no midsole in the heel and thin rubber the heel is very sensitive~ but doesn't protect your heel very much so sharp holds will bite you~ but it is easy to tell if you aren't locked into the heel hook.   The toe rand is a great accessory. It makes it easy to scum and hook the top of your foot and helps with crack jams (cracks are not an ideal use of the shoe~ but it works in a pinch).     The shoe seems to fit best on average volume~ narrow to average feet.  An 8.5 Pontas fits close to a 39 Sportiva Katana or Venom or a 9 Anasazi. It will soften in the first few days~ but should not be fit for stretch.  It should just feel a little stiff over the toes and that will soften out.     One of the biggest complaints about evolv is that the synthetic fabric starts to smell~ but synthetic fabric is also washable~ just don't machine dry them~ the black rubber will mess over your dryer.   Bottom line:  If you wouldn't NEED your laceups~ downturned shoe~ or crack boot~ then these will do it. From slabs to severe overhangs they do the trick.
856,montrail,wasabi,1.5,   I actually don't know if they would have turned out to be a good shoe. I ordered the shoe in a size 41 (euro) expecting them to fit perfectly seeing as I wear a woman's US 8-8.5. I couldn't even get my foot all the way into the shoe.    My mother then tried them on just to test. She wears an 8 US and a 40 euro~ and she was nowhere near getting her foot into the shoe either.    My advice~ DO NOT BUY CLIMBING SHOES ONLINE. If you can~ go to a store where you can try them on. I returned my pair and plan on buying a new pair in person. 
857,montrail,wasabi,4.5,   The Wasabi is a great shoe -- very comfortable and the rubber is pretty sticky. I've been climbing for 5 or 6 years and have worn Boreal~ Montrail~ and some FiveTens. These are by far the most comfortable pair I've worn while still managing to fit fairly tight.    The durability of the rubber isn't too great. These definitely aren't gym shoes. I use a pair of old Zealots for that. But on difficult outdoor routes~ especially ones that I'm trying to work~ these shoes are great.    Buy them a bit small~ they tend to stretch~ especially after you bake them in the oven.
858,montrail,wasabi,4.0,   Extremely comfortable - I went down a full size from my Mad Rock Locos and though they were a snugger fit~ the thermo-molded spots in the shoe made them very comfortable to wear for hours on end. The three velcro straps work well: the middle strap is reversed so you can really cinch down the straps for a tight~ lace-like fit.    At first~ they were the best shoes I had ever owned. They are still great~ however after two months of climbing twice a week~ the sole has started peeling away from the shoe at the toes~ probably from edging~ and as a result~ have lost their mirco-edging ability.    I would buy these shoes again if the edge lasted longer.
859,montrail,wasabi,2.0,   A good shoe for a while. The velcro fails. This shoe is not for the usual climber. Someone who doesn't climb that much will get more use out of it. Good at micro edging for the beginning of the shoe~ once rubber wears some~ they suck. About the same time~ the velcro will go out and it's time to have a viking funeral for them. 
860,montrail,wasabi,1.0,   Climbed in them for two months. The rubber has degraded horribly so they are now useless for edgeing. Worse yet~ the velcro has completely failed. This is a common problem with everyone I have met who owns these shoes. Wish I knew that before buying them. First and last pair of Montrails for me.
861,montrail,wasabi,5.0,   Top~ s'adapte parfaitement au pied! super pour le bloc et grimpe dynamique (très souple).
862,montrail,wasabi,4.0,   Since starting climbing I've owned a pair of Montrail Zealots followed by a pair of Methods and now most recently a pair of Wasabis. The Wasabis combine the superior rubber with the better fit of the Zealot. If anything~ they improve on the fit and comfort. Given that I was previously shoving my foot into a slipper~ I'm really happy to move on to the Wasabi. At the very least~ if you were as disappointed with the rubber Montrail started off using~ try out something with their newer stuff~ it's far better. 
863,montrail,wasabi,4.0,   The shoe is comfortable and are good for smearing technique. On certain foot types (like narrow feet) the shoes do not have a tight fit.
864,la-sportiva,taka,3.0,   As a beginner climber I got these shoes used from a gym and they supported me for climbing for three years of hitting the gym on and off. They worked great to help me get into climbing and taught me what to look for in my next pair.    Pros   Cons   These shoes fit pretty well~ but soon I learned they were a bit big. Overall though they are easy to get snug with the laces.   The heel fits great and so do the sides — plenty of room and they don't feel overly tight around the sides on wider feet. Since I bought these used~ they were already very well broken in and easy to bend and move your foot on holds.    The grip was pretty great still when they were well worn out. La Sportiva knows how to make pretty good rubber (it's not the greatest~ but way better than the cheaper brands - like Mad Rock or Evolv).   Having real leather sides~ they don't tend to be as smelly with sweat soaked feet as synthetic shoes. They are crazy durable too. I finally blew out the side climbing in Joshua Tree — yet I kept using the shoes for 4x more months of climbing on and off. Then I really blew out the side after I got a gym membership. That was when I upgraded to Five10 shoes that I got at the outlet store!      I do like the feel and design of La Sportiva way better than Five10. But both are my top two favorite brands so far. I am a semi-beginner climber only hitting gyms mainly (V-3 to V-4 bouldering and 5.10 to 5.10C). Yet I still know my stuff well enough. It's a great beginner shoe.
865,la-sportiva,tradmaster,2.0,   I've used this shoe on roughly 3000 ft of trad climbing in Eldorado Canyon and on California Granite. The shoe is very comfortable~ with a nicely padded heel and tongue. It is a stiff shoe~ but not overly so. The shoe performs well in cracks and on moderate face climbing~ but not so well on thin face climbing and friction.    I noticed right away that the rubber on this shoe did not seem to perform as well as the rubber on my La Sportiva Barracuda's~ and a little research at the company web site confirmed what I suspected. La Sportiva uses a different rubber~ their FriXon compound~ on this shoe. This appears to be the same rubber that they use on their approach shoes~my La Sportiva Exum Ridges are labeled with the FriXon Logo~ for example.     Pros: Comfortable~ good in cracks~ burly.   Cons: Rubber is not up to the standards of the other La Sportiva models (you will notice a difference)~ the shoe is not very sensitive~ but should last a long time.
866,la-sportiva,tradmaster,1.0,"   Weak shoe - one 90 ft Vedauwoo pitch put ~ 1.5 mm razor blade like slices in the rubber and the little edging I did on the route was starting to take chunks of rubber off the toe.  Maybe it was a bad batch of rubber but I'd avoid the friXion rubber in the future for the tried and true XSV that Sportiva still uses on their other shoes.   Aside: the toe of the Tradmaster isn't as pointy as the ""equivalent"" Focus model of a few years prior~ and is probably too blunt for most intermediate to advanced climbers."
867,la-sportiva,tradmaster,1.0,   Great all round and comfortable shoe -- or so I thought.   First pair blew out the seam and toe rand in eight weeks (12 outings!)   Replacement pair did same~ except after ONE DAY of climbing!!!   I'm done with Sportiva shoes.
868,black-diamond,camalot-c4,5.0,   Still the gold standard in camming devices. Superb construction and functionality; large camming range; competitively priced — I cannot imagine a better all-round cam.   Pros   Cons   Rack up with a set of C4s and your confidence will take a leap up — there is simply no better all-round cam. Great design and construction~ 4 lobes for maximum grip~ perfect camming angle~ biggest camming range~ smooth trigger action~ a thumb-loop for stability when placing~ pretty colours and years of on-the-job performance. There's no other cam I would rather fall on.    Supplement your C4s with a set of small narrow-head cams (master cams; x4s or aliens) and you are good for anything!
869,black-diamond,camalot-c4,5.0,   Amazing Cam!!! The action on BD's cams are incredible~ you can control each cam lobe with incredible precision. The expansion range on BD's C4's is a huge relief when your pumped and ran-out.  I will definitely pick more C4's up!!!
870,dmm,wallnut,5.0,   Great multi-purpose passive pro.   Pros   Cons   The DMM Wallnut is a superb nut for nearly all types of climbing. I've used these in gneiss~ granite~ and limestone.   The thing that sets the Wallnuts apart is a longer shape~ that tapers differently with the sides being more offset. This results in a variety of more useful placements. Practically speaking these offer more secure fits in a lot of spots compared to simpler nuts. I've got a set of BD/Grand Wall nuts I have compared them with side by side.    The other perk is that the Wallnuts have a deep groove in the middle. This has a significant benefit especially in granite where this allows the nut to be placed despite awkward crystals~ or even use small bumps as a means to stop the nuts walking. It's one of those things that until you have it seems frivolous but then feels disappointing whenever a tool doesn't have that feature.   They are a little pricey and it's a piece you seldom want to leave behind. Also the smallest size is still pretty big.
871,dmm,wallnut,5.0,   Best stoppers on the market. Really. Great placement~ retrievable.   Use 'em enough you'll see the difference.
872,msr,snow-fluke,5.0,   I found the MSR fluke to have some interesting and potentially significant improvements over older designs. This extension of their venture into anchors~ in keeping with the full name of MSR (Mountain Safety Research)~ is a further development of their Coyote Picket~ introduced in 1987~ which in turn followed the 1969-70 MSR Snow Picket and Snow Fluke.       MSR also had an ice ax and ice screws in their line in the 1970s. MSR~ a division of Cascade Designs~ is better known these days for their excellent stove designs (with a couple of exceptions)~ innovative snowshoes~ and tents. Cascade Designs also makes sleeping pads (Therm-a-Rest)~ SealLine dry bags~ and water treatment systems.   Pros   Cons      Location of gear test on Mt Hood.   Size:  Fluke - 11 x 6-¾ in (Large)   Color: aluminum   Weight:   Fluke 8- ¾ oz  (Large)   Suggested price:  Fluke - $50 for version tested (L)~ $40 for small   Warranty: standard Cascades Designs Limited Warranty   Background: Over the years~ I have used a variety of commercially and homemade pickets and flukes~ almost exclusively for practicing crevasse rescues (thankfully~ only a couple of real retrievals of fellow team members and a few more retrievals of members of other teams).   One of the vital requirements is being able to quickly place anchors while in a self-arrest position. Both pickets and flukes were designed with this requirement in mind. Flukes are particularly rapid~ especially when the cable is properly attached.   On challenging climbs where falls~ injuries~ or other incidents are possible~ dependable protection in the form of anchors is vital. Because snow~ whether fresh-fallen~ softened by the sun~ consolidated~ or firmed into neve has less holding power than rock~ water ice~ or alpine ice~ anchors for use in crossing glaciers or ascending steep snow slopes must present a large cross-section~ while at the same time being light enough to carry a sufficient quantity for the climb at hand. This means that they are by necessity physically larger than can be carried on a sling like chocks or cams.   One of the main uses is for protection on steep snow slopes or when crossing a crevassed glacier~ where the crevasses may be hidden under the snow or crossed by an iffy snow bridge~ as well as having a solid anchor that can be placed rapidly to aid in retrieving an unfortunate climber who has fallen into a crevasse and needs to be retrieved quickly before hypothermia sets in.      Common method of using ice ax head to hammer pickets and flukes into snow   Most teams carry a combination of flukes and pickets~ sometimes one of each for each team member~ sometimes only a couple of each in the whole party. Despite most snow anchors being made of aluminum~ the weight for a team could easily add up to the weight of an old-school piton rack for big wall climbing.   So an additional requirement to ease of placement~ light weight~ and ample cross-section (hence holding power) is ease of retrieval to move on to the next location. The reason for having a mix of pickets and flukes is the variance of snow conditions. Both pickets and flukes are usually hammered into the snow using the head of the ice ax as shown in the photo above~ which will damage both the top of the fluke or picket and the head of the ice ax with time.      MSR Snow Anchors tested (Fluke on right~ picket on left)   Flukes are shaped roughly like the blade of a shovel (on the right in the photo). They are equipped with a swaged steel cable with a loop placed such as to cause a pull to force the fluke to “dive” further into the snow~ thus increasing its anchoring power.   Contrary to what one might think~ the central vertical bend in the fluke is point forward. This turns out to be the best shape for causing the fluke to act like a plow and dig further under the snow. When properly placed~ the upper cable is tight and parallel to the surface of the snow~ while the lower cable is tight and coming directly out of the snow~ pulling in the downslope direction.   Details:    Trailspace’s Chief of Gear Reviews~ Seth~ sent me an email asking if I would like to review a pair of new snow anchoring devices. Despite the fact that it was summer~ I was already planning to head for the Cascades to do some climbing on glaciated peaks. Most of the testing took place on the Zigzag Glacier on the slopes of Mt. Hood~ not far from the Silcox Hut (upper portion of the mountain in the intro photograph).   I intended to use the lower reaches of the Palmer Glacier~ but was informed on getting there that~ with the intensive summer training of would-be junior Olympians using that area for their practice ski racing and snowboard gymnastics~ I would have to move over to the currently designated Climbers Route. The heat wave had spread from the eastern 2/3 of the continent toward the West~ which meant that the surface 6 inches of the glacier surface was mushy~ while the ice below that was basically neve~ potentially a challenge for anchors.   I reviewed the large (9 ounce~ 8-3/4 ounces on my electronic scale) version of the fluke. There will also be a 7 ounce version of the fluke. At this writing~ I still have a few minor questions that Seth has relayed for me to MSR that await responses. When the responses get to me~ I will add any needed relevant notes. Because (1) snow pickets and flukes perform similar functions and (2) MSR provided both the new picket and new fluke at the same time~ the reviews for both (this Snow Fluke and the Snow Picket) overlap and contain several identical sections.   The fluke is made of 7000-series aircraft aluminum. Though similar in size to my SMC fluke~ the MSR differs significantly in having larger lightening holes plus the riveted-on polyurethane-covered nylon scrim (think of nylon bug screening~ but of a much stronger material for the mesh). The main purpose of this is to lighten the fluke~ while also improving performance.   When I weighed the new MSR fluke~ I found it weighed a quarter ounce less than the weight given in the press release~ though a full ounce heavier than my older (and smaller surface area) SMC fluke.   Closeup of MSR fluke showing scrim-reinforced polyurethane facing      Upper edge of MSR fluke~ showing grommet reinforcement on cable hole and swaging      Upper edge of SMC fluke~ showing swage and lack of grommet for comparison to MSR   The SMC is the fluke on the left in the photo below~ while the new MSR is the fluke on the right. In a close-up of the lower part of the MSR (above)~ you can see the scrim through the translucent material. The upper part of the MSR fluke is slightly peaked~ rather than flat like the older SMC. This does not seem to make any difference when driving it into the snow~ at least for the softer upper layers on the glacier I encountered during my testing.   One other thing to note in the photo of the upper part of the fluke is that the holes through which the cable passes are grommeted~ unlike the holes on the SMC. This should increase lifetime by reducing wear between the cable and the fluke. For comparison~ the rear of the SMC is shown~ so that the lack of a grommet can be seen. The swages on the cable on both front and back sides of the flukes (found on both the MSR and SMC flukes) are intended to limit the motion of the cable and maintain the proper relative angles of the top and bottoms sections when loaded.        SMC fluke on left~ new MSR fluke on right prior to being properly placed in snow   As noted in the “cons” list above~ I have found in actual practice that the type of rivet used to secure the polyurethane to the fluke’s frame can fail over time. But I will also note that this is the same type of rivet used on MSR’s snowshoes.   Barbara and I lead snowshoe hikes~ as most readers of Trailspace know. I have not seen a rivet failure on any of the MSR snowshoes on these hikes~ although I have seen failures of similar rivets on most other brands of snowshoes. Knowing that MSR gear is generally very durable~ I have less worry about rivet failure on the MSR flukes than I would other brands~ plus the rivets are not located in high-stress positions on the fluke.   The testing procedure for the fluke was similar to that used for the picket. The fluke was placed in the snow tilted relative to the snow surface with the upper cable parallel to the surface and a slot cut in the snow so the lower cable would be aligned straight to the eye of the cable~ in the proper orientation as shown in the diagram above. Neglecting this trench will result in the fluke being levered out of the snow.   A single carabiner was placed in the eye and the rope attached to the carabiner and to my harness. I then applied body weight~ then tugged harder~ finally leaving about 10 feet of slack and ran down the slope until arrested by the fluke.   The end result of one of these runs is shown in the wide photo below~ taken by a curious climber returning from a training foray up on the Palmer Glacier in preparation for his ascent attempt the following day. The MSR fluke dove further into the snow on my first placement.   On the other hand~ I did not place the SMC quite right at first try~ with the result that~ although it did dive further into the snow and held my running shock load~ it displaced the soft snow at the top by about an inch while diving a couple inches deeper. The second placement behaved as expected~ with no displacement of the surface snow and the fluke diving deeper as it should.   The better performance of the MSR can possibly be attributed to several factors. First~ I believe I placed the MSR fluke more correctly on first try~ and placed the SMC fluke slightly too vertically (top cable not as parallel to the surface as it should have been). Second~ the polyurethane on the MSR with its more complete coverage and non-freezing to the snow probably allowed the fluke to dive more efficiently. A third factor is that the upper cable length on the MSR fluke is 20% longer than the lower cable~ a greater difference than the SMC.   This means that when the upper cable is parallel to the surface~ the fluke angle of the MSR lays back almost 10 degrees farther~ thus entering the snow at a shallower angle. Another way of looking at this is that the pull on the lower cable has a stronger tendency to pull the fluke deeper into the snow.   Conclusion:   The new MSR snow fluke has several significant improvements over older versions. It performed better in my limited tests than my older gear.  As with everything~ the new gear will cost more than the old. The price on REI.com for the small and large SMC flukes are available for $32 and $36~ compared to the MSR press release of $40 and $50.   If you are heading off for some glacier travel or ascending glaciated and snow-covered peaks~ I would choose these new MSR anchors over the older designs.
873,msr,snow-picket,5.0,   I found the MSR snow picket to have some interesting and potentially significant improvements over older designs. This extension of their venture into anchors~ in keeping with the full name of MSR (Mountain Safety Research) is a further development of their Coyote Picket~ introduced in 1987~ which in turn followed the 1969-70 MSR Snow Picket and Snow Fluke.       MSR also had an ice ax and ice screws in their line in the 1970s. MSR~ a division of Cascade Designs~ is better known these days for their excellent stove designs (with a couple of exceptions)~ innovative snowshoes~ and tents. Cascade Designs also makes sleeping pads (Therm-a-Rest)~ SealLine dry bags~ and water treatment systems.   Pros   Cons   Size: Picket – 23-7/8 in (S)   Color: aluminum   Weight:  Picket 14-3/8 oz (S)   Suggested price: Picket - $30 for version tested (S)~ $40 for long   Cascades Designs Limited Warranty      OGBO at the testing site on Mt Hood~ just above the ski area.   Background: Over the years~ I have used a variety of commercially and homemade pickets and flukes~ almost exclusively for practicing crevasse rescues (thankfully~ only a couple of real retrievals of fellow team members and a few more retrievals of members of other teams).   One of the vital requirements is being able to quickly place anchors while in a self-arrest position. Both pickets and flukes were designed with this requirement in mind. Flukes are particularly rapid~ especially when the cable is properly attached.   On challenging climbs where falls~ injuries~ or other incidents are possible~ dependable protection in the form of anchors is vital. Because snow~ whether fresh-fallen~ softened by the sun~ consolidated~ or firmed into neve has less holding power than rock~ water ice~ or alpine ice~ anchors for use in crossing glaciers or ascending steep snow slopes must present a large cross-section~ while at the same time being light enough to carry a sufficient quantity for the climb at hand. This means that they are by necessity physically larger than can be carried on a sling like chocks or cams.   One of the main uses is for protection on steep snow slopes or when crossing a crevassed glacier~ where the crevasses may be hidden under the snow or crossed by an iffy snow bridge~ as well as having a solid anchor that can be placed rapidly to aid in retrieving an unfortunate climber who has fallen into a crevasse and needs to be retrieved quickly before hypothermia sets in.   Most teams carry a combination of flukes and pickets~ sometimes one of each for each team member~ sometimes only a couple of each in the whole party. Despite most snow anchors being made of aluminum~ the weight for a team could easily add up to the weight of an old-school piton rack for big wall climbing. So an additional requirement to ease of placement~ light weight~ and ample cross-section (hence holding power) is ease of retrieval to move on to the next location.   The reason for having a mix of pickets and flukes is the variance of snow conditions. Both pickets and flukes are usually hammered into the snow using the head of the ice ax as shown in the photo below~ which will damage both the top of the fluke or picket and the head of the ice ax. Alternatively~ if an ice tool with a hammer head instead of an adze is available~ the hammer head may be used to drive the picket into the snow.   Common method used to hammer pickets and flukes into position   Pickets come in various lengths~ and are most commonly made from T-shaped aluminum stock~ with some being made from an angular stock (not necessarily right-angle) to reduce weight. They have one or more holes sized to take a standard oval carabiner. More holes allows for variability in the depth to which a vertical placement can be hammered or alternatively placement as a deadman.   In general~ a picket should be placed with a back-lean and as deep in the snow as possible (more surface area against the snow is better). If~ for some reason~ the picket cannot be sunk full length vertically~ or if the snow is soft enough that the lever action of the exposed part is suspected of being too great~ a deadman positioning is called for~ with a sling placed in the hole at (or nearest) the middle~ or even girth-hitched to the exact center. The new MSR snow picket is on the left in the photo below.   MSR's new picket (left) and fluke (right)   Details: Trailspace’s Chief of Gear Reviews~ Seth~ asked if I would like to review a pair of new snow anchoring devices. Despite the fact that it was summer~ I was already planning to head for the Cascades to do some climbing on glaciated peaks. Most of the testing took place on the Zigzag Glacier on the slopes of Mt. Hood~ not far from the Silcox Hut (upper portion of the mountain in the intro photograph).   I intended to use the lower reaches of the Palmer Glacier~ but was informed on getting there that~ with the intensive summer training of would-be junior Olympians using that area for their practice ski racing and snowboard gymnastics~ that I would have to move over to the currently designated Climbers Route. The heat wave had spread from the eastern 2/3 of the continent toward the West~ which meant that the surface 6 inches of the glacier surface was mushy~ while the ice below that was basically neve~ potentially a challenge for anchors.   I reviewed the short version of the picket (2-foot~ 23-7/8 inches by my measurement~ and 14-3/8 oz on my electronic scale vs. 14 oz on the spec sheet). There will also be a 3-foot version of the picket. Curiously~ the press release describes the length of the 2-foot version as 90 cm (which is about 3 feet) and the 3 foot version as 60 cm (about 2 feet). Use caution reading press releases – talk directly to the designers and engineers!    At this writing~ I still have a few minor questions that Seth has relayed for me to MSR that await responses. When the responses get to me~ I will add any needed relevant notes. Because (1) snow pickets and flukes perform similar functions and (2) MSR provided both the new picket and new fluke at the same time~ the reviews for both (this Snow Picket and the Snow Fluke) overlap and contain several identical sections.   First thing I noticed out of the shipping container with the picket was that basically it was very similar to the older versions of MSR pickets (the Coyote model) – formed out of aircraft-grade T-shaped 6000-series aluminum with the stem of the “T” having a reinforcing flange for the full length.    MSR has made a few interesting improvements. One is the black anodized aluminum hammering cap on the top. Given that on many climbs involving snow or ice~ climbers often have just their ice ax and do not carry ice tools with a hammer head~ this provides protection against mushrooming of the top of the picket as well as protecting the head of the ice ax. See the second image in this review to see the all too common method of using the ice ax to drive in pickets and flukes.   When I first looked at the hammering cap~ I thought it was plastic. However~ the development person at the Cascade Designs booth at the OR Show assured me it was aluminum. Ever the scientist~ when I got home~ I had to test it. A resistance check with my DMM showed infinite resistance (or zero conductance~ as you choose to term it). Many plastics of course show the same~ as would an anodized surface. So I made a small scratch and I pounded the corrugated top surface a number of times with my framing hammer~ both of which exposed tiny shiny spots that I could check the resistance/conductance.   Sure enough~ the resistance between exposed metal spots was in the fractional ohm range~ as you would expect with aluminum. Anodized surfaces will also show infinite resistance (or zero conductance)~ so I checked several of my anodized aluminum cookpots to confirm the high resistance/low conductance. I am now convinced that the hammer cap is aluminum.   I will note as well that the repeated framing hammer blows produced no mushrooming~ which gives confidence that repeated placements~ hammered into the snow with an ice ax head or ice tool will allow a long life of repeated placements of the picket. Some of my personal pickets do show mushrooming.   The second change I noticed was the shaped point at the bottom of the picket. The pointed tip is also a change from the older Coyote model (I checked in my neighborhood REI~ which has the Coyote in stock at present)~ as well as many other T-stock pickets.   As can be seen in the third image~ the sample provided had the pointed end coated in red to provide for rapid and correct orientation for a vertical placement (remember the old adage that in an emergency~ your IQ drops to single digits). When I asked about this at the Summer Outdoor Retailer Show~ I was told that the production version would not have the red tip~ although I personally think it would be a good idea.   As typical these days~ there are a number of chamfered holes placed along the stem of the “T” section for placement of carabiners or slings. In vertical placement~ the point of attachment is the hole closest to the snow/ice surface to reduce leverage and potential failure of the anchor~ as in the image below. Usually~ if at all possible~ the picket is sunk all the way to the top-most hole.    The reason for chamfering the holes is to enlarge the contact surface between the carabiner or sling and the picket. One slight criticism is that the chamfering was strictly angular~ where in my older personal pickets it is more rounded and smoother. The sample may have been an early release for review~ since other~ older MSR pickets have had smoother hole edges in my experience.      Picket in vertical placement   For testing purposes~ I placed both the MSR and an older personal picket in the vertical orientation as in the photo above~ then applied body weight~ followed by a run beginning with several feet of slack to provide a mild shock test. Both pickets performed the same~ showing no displacement.   This of course does not provide the same severity of test as a factor 2 free fall into a crevasse might (I am not willing to jump into a crevasse deliberately when solo on the mountain~ though the solidity of the placements gave me confidence in the security provided by both the MSR and the personal picket).      Picket placed in trench for deadman usage   For the next test~ I set up a deadman placement. During crevasse rescues~ this is actually the most common placement. As in the photo above~ a horizontal trench is dug transverse to the fall line several inches deep (depending on the consistency of the snow) the length of the picket. Then with a sling attached to the middle of the picket (in the hole in the middle of the picket~ or if it is one of the old pickets without a middle hole~ girth-hitched in the middle)~ a trench is cleared transverse to the first trench~ so that the pull on the buried picket is in a direct line. Without this alignment trench~ the sling would just pull the picket straight up out of the snow. The trenches are filled with snow and tamped down~ as in the next photo.   The MSR picket has a red plastic sticker on both sides of the central hole for easy identification~ as can be seen in the earlier image of the picket and fluke side by side. It appears to me that the sticker will not last more than a few placements of the picket. This is of little concern~ since it is quite easy to estimate which is the center hole.      Picket and most of sling buried for anchoring   I again applied body weight and several running tests to shock load the placement. Examination of the placement showed only minor compacting of the snow~ as expected. In my experience~ the deadman placement has always proven dependable during training sessions~ including dropping 100 kg weights 4 or 5 meters into a crevasse on a single deadmanned short picket set 5 meters from the lip of the crevasse (the rope usually digs into the lip in such a test~ which makes hauling the weights~ or a human victim~ back out a real chore even with the 6:1 mechanical advantage of a C-Z pulley setup with high quality pulleys). I should note that the stretch of a dynamic rope does reduce the shock load.   The end result of one of these runs is shown in the wide photo below~ taken by a curious climber returning from a training foray up on the Palmer Glacier in preparation for his ascent attempt the following day~ who I convinced to use my camera to take the photo.      Conclusion:   The new MSR Snow Picket has several significant improvements over older versions. It performed better in my limited tests than my older gear. As with everything~ the new gear will cost more than the old. The price on REI.com for the older Coyote pickets is $20 and $25~ compared to the press release prices of $30 and $40 for the same lengths of the new pickets.   If you are heading off for some glacier travel or ascending glaciated and snow-covered peaks~ I would choose these new MSR anchors over the older designs.
874,dmm,dragon-cam,5.0,   Pros   Cons   I've used Dragons for the past three years and love them. I've climbed with them on granite~ limestone~ quartzite and sandstone. I've done cragging with them as well as alpine climbing.    The newest version are awesome~ and while the weight savings and unanodized lobes are nifty~ they don't really add much except piece of mind.   But these are phenomenal cams. The workmanship is superb~ and I love not having to grab a draw when placing these on crack routes in particular thanks to the extendable slings. The sizing is straightforward and consistent with the other twin axle cams on the market so you don't have to learn new sizings. The pull is soft and consistent. and they place like any other cam I've used.   The BDs are the obvious comparison~ and while the Dragons lack a thumb loop~ making them challenging to use for aid climbing~ they do feel a little more robust. Subjectively I prefer the balance of them~ and find them easier to handle in awkward places~ though I prefer the length of the Wild Country Friends for deep cracks.    
875,metolius,ultralight-fat-cam,4.5,   I love these cams. Although they are harder to contract then the BD they work great in the rock. I have all the sizes and the colour coding system make it so easy to recognize the sizes. They're as strong as any other cam out there and some off the lightest ones available. Great stuff~ love Metolius gear.   Pros   Cons   I bought a full spread of the ultralight cams last season and love them. Although it is the first set of cams I have owned I have used other one and researched them extensively before purchasing them.   I really like the colour coding system even thought other companies are doing it I like Metolius's colours best. I also enjoy the grip in comparison to the BD~ which I find does not fit well in my palm. These have the same friction as any other cam so no cam is safer than another~ which makes the decision based itself off aesthetics~ weight and how it feels in your hand.   These cams where the best for me~ but it is different for people with different techniques of placing.
876,dmm,deadman,4.0,   I always keep one of these within reach in the lid of my pack. It is definitely not my go-to protection on any routine basis~ but this fluke excels at being quick to place when you need protection in a hurry~ and the snow is not sufficiently consolidated to hold a picket in a deadman / T-slot configuration without first compacting / tamping the snow~ and sometimes you just don't have time to do that.    For example~ I might use the fluke as a first anchor to backup a climber holding a crevasse fall before a proper system can be setup~ or to strengthen a sitting belay on a snow slope descent. In contrast to a picket or ice axe~ the fluke will force itself deeper under load (when properly placed)~ so it is nice to have when the snow is sketchy.    Having said that~ there is no question that a properly embedded picket or ice axe~ or a bollard when the snow will accommodate one~ is more secure~ so the utility of the fluke versus deciding to carry its weight is a tradeoff for many. Protection is a toolbox~ and for me~ the set of tools would be incomplete without this fluke.    There are probably lighter options than the DMM Deadman Bent — I selected the DMM simply because of the apparent design attention to detail in comparison to offerings from other manufacturers. 
877,wild-country,helium-friends,5.0,   These lightweight improvements on the original design for spring loaded camming devices are great for trad~ alpine~ and beyond.   Pros   Cons   I began my trad career on Friends~ so these for me are a great system to use.   Overall they perform great on limestone~ quartzite on granite. I am comfortable with all sizes ranges and I did find them a little tricky to get back into~ but now that I am used to them again I find placements easy as ever.   In large cracks their longer than average stems are definitely an asset. Quartzite crack in particular I find this really handy.     I always found~ especially when I was starting out~ that double axle cams walked a good deal. I am aware better placements avoid this~ but even so I just like that I don't have to be quite as specific with single axle cams~ particularly when I'm pumped.   The same goes for the debate regarding sizes. A full rack of Heliums weighs 30 grams more than a BD rack of equivalent size~ however you get two extra cams for that. To me at least I prefer to have extras should they be needed for effectively the same weight. But I totally understand how that is more expensive~ and less efficient. Preference is what it comes down to.   The chief downside that I have found is just that most people aren't used to the sizing. Where I climb most people used BD~ which I don't mind~ but am just not as fond of. Sadly all these people refuse to use my rack as they find it confusing. So normally it gets left behind~ or I take my DMM Dragons.    I do do have a couple with the new extendable slings. Love them. So handy in the alpine~ and it's great when you can just pull the leash out rather than reach for a draw.    
878,omega-pacific,link-cam,4.0,   The larger (gold) LinkCam has quickly become an indispensable piece on my rack. Its range runs from all of .75~ #1 & #2 Camalot as well as much of a .5; while heavy for a single cam~ it weighs less than any of those two combined.   Uses:   It's absolutely the ticket on pitches where you need a few pieces from a wide range of sizes. Rather than doubling up on all sizes~ take one of each and a LinkCam. Note: save the LinkCam to you have to use it.   It's a great desperation piece~ in hard to hang on~ hard to gauge the size situations.   It's a superior piece for blind placements as its large range makes it much more likely to be securely placed in such situations.   Disadvantages: heavy~ expensive and has a lot of working parts and thus could be relatively fragile~ though I've encountered no such problems.   Note: the smaller size (red) does not seem nearly as worthwhile as the larger as it covers a considerably smaller range.   Wish list: A larger size?
879,rock-empire,robot-cam,3.0,   While these cams do not have the range per piece (or as an entire set) of BD C4s or Wild Country Friends~ they are much cheaper. Robot cams are also a bit heavier than equal size of other cams.       While essentially not as good a cam as its competitors~ the price of Robot cams is so low that they are great for the climber on a budget. In the Czech Republic these cams retail for $25 each~ regardless of size. In the US I found a set of 8 for $150 shipped.       At this type of price the cash strapped climber would have 2-3 competitors' cams.   Pros   Cons   For the climber on a very tight budget~ this is a great set of cams to consider. You can get a decent set of eight cams from .25 in to 5 in for about $150~ depending on the deals on the Rock Empire site or good fortune on ebay. For that money you would only get 2-3 pieces from a competitor. If you can't afford a full set of cams this might be your only option besides getting (heavily) used cams.   Rock Empire Robots are heavier and have a smaller range than others~ compared to BD C4s I have used they do not place as well and are not as easy to retrieve as a second. They are very durable though~ and though I have not tried it~ it appears that the cam lobes can be taken apart with an allen wrench and cleaned. The pull cables are very durable wires as well.
880,trango,maxcam,2.0,   These cams are adequate~ but that's the best I can say for them. I bought the whole set~ from .5-3 and have since taken the .5~ .75~ and 1 off of my standard rack. The 2 and 3 are fine~ and most of the bad stuff I have to say about these cams is less of an issue with them.    The 2:1 expansion range is really only an in-theory kind of thing. When they're cammed all the way down~ the shape of the outer lobes makes this cam prone to getting stuck--passively. I've spent more time cleaning these cams than any other piece I've ever used because of this. I'm a little sketched about using cams that I've wailed on with a nut tool~ as well. At the other end of their expansion range~ these guys are spooky. They walk; they spin; and they just seem unstable. With neither end of their expansion spectrum being confidence inspiring--to say the least--I only use these cams when it's absolutely necessary because I'm out of that size or when I'm sure I won't fall on the placement (so~ why did I even place it?).   There's a lot of griping about the weird way that these have to be placed. It took me maybe three tries to get it down: place the outer lobes against the side of the crack~ and let the inner ones expand to meet the opposing wall. It's not hard; it's different. If these cams didn't have such a high spook factor~ the strange placement style wouldn't figure so prominently into other reviews.   They aren't horrible~ but they certainly aren't outperforming pieces that cost half as much. After about a year of steady use~ they are holding up moderately well~ but only moderately (my Camalots still seem new~ and a few of those have taken falls). I buy nice gear because I like to feel solid climbing above it. These don't fit that bill 100% of the time.   Bottom line: if you get 'em on sale to fill out your rack for splitters~ go for it. If the placements aren't necessarily straightforward where you're climbing or these will be your only piece in the size~ go for something else.
881,mammut,genesis-dry-8.5,5.0,"   Fantastic~ lightweight and sturdy double ropes. Unlike others I have seen~ these don't tangle or get ""ringlets"" and after 6 years they're not fuzzy.      Very smooth through the belay device~ these ropes are great for rappelling and easy retrieval as well as good handling while belaying.   Pros   Cons   Fantastic~ lightweight and sturdy double ropes. Unlike others I have seen~ these don't tangle or get ""ringlets"".   Very smooth through the belay device~ these ropes are great for rappelling and easy retrieval as well as good handling while belaying.   If you're new to double ropes:   Mammut Genesis are dry treated~ though I've not used them for mountaineering purposes. They've survived sleet~ sub zero conditions and tons of rainy descents and lots of mud. Not to mention~ 6 years of solid climbing.      Mammut Genesis - Dolomites~ Italy"
882,edelweiss,discover-8-mm,5.0,"   My new favorite rope for glacier travel.   Pros   Cons    ME: So~ you carry the tent and stove and I'll carry the rope?"" Partner who hasn't seen the rope yet: ""That sounds fair."" ME: *Smiles.    My rope is under 3 pounds   I bought this rope for one reason; low-angle glacier travel on Mt. Rainier~ Baker~ etc. At 8mm this 30m rope won't work with many belay devices so TRY IT OUT WITH YOUR PRUSIKS AND BELAY DEVICES BEFORE YOU GO CLIMB!   Caveat:  I am using this rope as a single rope even though it is ONLY rated as a twin. Currently this practice is EXTREMELY common and widely accepted even though~ for legal reasons~ you won't hear it talked about much.  The kind of people who learn mountaineering from books and overbooked seminars with popular clubs based in Seattle will call this irresponsible~ but the odds of me taking anything like a fall on a crag are zero on low angle glaciers where I use this rope.  If you are doing high angle climbing this is not your rope.    When I am traveling on glaciers the risk of falling into a crevasse is pretty slim~ but I still need a rope I could rig a z-pulley with or prusik out with and this rope suits both of those criteria~ but I would never jug on this or use it in ice climbing or cragging unless I had another one to pair it with. Plus~ it's just 30m.    My prusiks are 7mm and work fine with this rope~ but some brands of accessory cord are too stiff and you could get a nasty surprise if you actually had to self rescue from a slot.    Test Conditions: Mount Rainier~ DC route~ July   Rainier   Weight: Hello? It's 2.7 freaking pounds! Compare that to your nine pound cragging rope and I think I am done explaining here. I'd carry this rope anywhere.    Waterproof: I drug this rope up Disappointment Cleaver through mud~ pumice~ and slush to the summit. It did not absorb a drip of water and the coating helped the rope stay soft and smooth. It cleaned right up. It has a dry treated core and sheath.    This is what this rope is for   Flexibility: This rope is so thin that it can't help be a little flexible but it really excels here. It feels buttery soft and my climb partners all said~ ""Ooohhh~"" when they felt how nicely it handled.    Pumice and slush didn't touch it   Durability: My knucklehead partners tromped all over this thing in crampons (I probably am a little overly sensitive to this) and luckily it shows no signs of wear.    Red is the perfect glacier color IMO   Middle Mark: I put it on with a sharpie   Conclusion: Light is fast and fast is safe. Period.    Glacier travel is where this rope crushes. Cragging? No. If your partners insist on bringing some 60 meter 10mm monster rope because some book they read or seminar they took said they have to~ whatever~ as long as THEY carry it. "
883,beal,joker-9.1-mm,4.5,"   Light is right. A very versatile rope.   Pros   Cons   Recently I lost 30 or so pounds~ so you may ask~ “Why do you care what your rope weighs? Now you can carry more stuff easier.”   The answer is~ “Because I can.” Would Mallory have worn hobnailed boots and wool if he had been able to wear fleece and nylon? Of course not~ light is right.   My main workhorse climbing rope is a 10.2mm monster that is fantastic till I need to carry it. I saw that Beal was making a thin rope that works in single~ half or twin configurations and is only 9.1 mm and happened to be on sale so what is a man to do?       Can you locate the middle mark?    9.1 is pretty thin and I was worried that it may not work in my belay device~ but no worries~ I use an ATC (I have all three styles) so I am good down to 8.0mm or so.  In guide mode the ATC Guide still locks up tight. I am told that some devices may not be compatible with this thinner rope.  Caveat emptor!   The Joker is smooth and has the right amount of flex for me and slides like a greased eel through gear while I am climbing~ making things feel even lighter than they are. The bright color shows up well on the snow and the middle mark is visible from a mile away. Of course it shows dirt faster but this is mainly~ for me~ an alpine rope and I am not working projects with it in the dirt.       After this day the rope was dry by the time I got home from laying out in the back seat of my car. The guide I was with was eying it with envy and said it had a good ""hand.""   The rope as a lot of elongation compared to the 10.2 I usually climb on so care must be taken (the leader must not fall?) when climbing near the deck. Like I said~ I am using this rope mainly for the mountains rather than the local sport crag.    I had to go to thinner cordage to get a prussic to grab well so the smooth sheath must be considered and a Bachman knot is out of the question so it does have its issues but I understand and manage them.    I hear that older Beal ropes are kink and knot monsters capable of creating a perfect Turk’s Head while hanging in a stiff breeze~ but I see no such vices in the Joker.      A good rope for those who:   Want one rope to serve all three configurations (single~ double~ twin). One rope to rule them all!   Like yellow.   Want a lighter rope so they can carry more food (or booze~ let’s be honest).   Can’t afford a $250 rope.   Climb mountains but have a double dry rope for extended wet trips.   Need all the help they can get to reach that next climbing grade."
884,bluewater-ropes,9.7mm-lightning-pro,3.5,   Climbs well~ lightweight at 61g / m~ nice looking color (especially the bi-pattern)~ but sheath wears quickly.   Pros   Cons   Almost everything about this rope is great for backcountry climbing. Lightweight~ easy to handle~ good color.   However~ the sheath has worn faster than expected in a couple places~ to the point where it is ready to be retired after only having been climbed on <50 times over two years. Fortunately the sheath wear is close to one end of the rope so I can trim ~10m off and still have a 60m rope~ but that means that the bi-pattern will no longer mark the new middle point of the rope.   Experience   I have climbed ~50 times with this rope over two years~ mostly multi-pitch routes or routes with a long approach where the lighter rope is beneficial.
885,bluewater-ropes,9.7mm-lightning-pro,5.0,   Feeds great. This rope is a great size for a thinner workhorse option.    Pros   I use this rope as my go-to option if I can only take one rope with me to the crag. The Lightning Pro feeds great on belay~ clips smoothly~ and the color definitely pops in pics too~ which is a bonus.   I have taken some whippers on this rope~ and it is elastic enough to give me a soft catch~ but durable enough to withstand all the route projecting I use it on.     I climb primarily sport routes in dry climates~ and I haven't tested the dry-treated options
886,maxim,equinox-10.2mm,4.0,   After a year of weekend climbing I still like this rope.   Pros   Cons   I didn't expect a lot from a rope in this price range~ yet I was pleasantly surprised.    The rope~ after a year of weekend sport climbing during nice weather~ shows very few signs of wear; one broken strand in the whole rope. I saw a lot of other climbers using this rope right after I bought it so evidently I was not the only one who jumped on the clearance deal at REI.   It started out stiff and it has softened up in this time~ but it will never be butter smooth and I am fine with that. When it was new it was a tad hard for my kids to feed into an ATC~ but not excessively so.    I took a small (5-6 foot) leader fall and the rope stopped me very smoothly and I hardly felt any force at all. I am over 200# so I felt sorry for the rope. My climbing buddy took a similar fall and said it felt fine; he's a clydesdale too. The rope still has seven more falls in it according to the specs.    The dry finish is listed as half dry so the core and mantle aren't both treated but I don't climb in bad weather (it's too nice here) so it's not really an issue. I have had it twist up once recently after we had been climbing on it all day and not taking time to straighten it out.    So it's green and white; an ugly green and white! At least no one will covet it! The white actually tells me when I need to wash it so it's not all bad. I used a Sharpie TEC pen to mark the middle (approved by NE Ropes) since a less expensive rope shouldn't be expected to have a mark from the factory.   See my avatar pic (or any of my pics climbing) to see me using it.    I would buy this rope again knowing what I do now.    Update 08/2015:After three seasons~ I retired this rope and made it into a mat. It was feeling stiff and had lost much of its stretch. We had a good run.    Next time I'll make it less tight.
887,sterling,evolution-velocity-9.8mm,4.5,   We have been running these ropes at Sylvan Rocks Climbing School for the past two seasons. Dragging them around the Needles of Custer State Park in South Dakota~ and up Devils Tower~ they take quite a beating. When you are teaching people to climb~ they fall~ ropes get worked! We are always looking at other ropes for durability~ but balanced with ease of pulling through our belay devices and such.   For now~ this is the best we have found for the money. There are probably better ropes out there~ but none we have found are this good at this price point~ and they are better then many we have tried that cost more.   No doubt larger diameter ropes last longer~ but at the cost of increased effort to manage them~ the guides all appreciate these strings. If you want your string to last more then a season or two~ get a larger diameter rope....If you like Starbucks over Folgers~ buy a Velocity and be happy.   Daryl Stisser Sylvan Rocks Climbing School
888,sterling,evolution-velocity-9.8mm,0.5,   I have been climbing for about a decade~ and and I can say that without any doubt~ the Sterling Evolution Velocity 9.8mm is the worst rope that I have ever used. Every time I used it~ the fuzz would become worse and worse. After only one week of use the fuzz had revealed the core~ necessitating the rope to be cut.   I contacted Sterling~ and even sent them the damaged section of rope (from Australia)~ and their response was extremely disappointing. They were extremely slow to respond to my emails~ and when they finally got back to me~ they advised me that there was nothing wrong with the rope.   I have heard others say that they are very pleased with their Sterling Evolution Velocity rope. So perhaps I bought a lemon. Regardless~ I am going to avoid buying ropes from Sterling in the future!
889,diy,paracord,5.0,   I write this due to the abundance of so called paracord on the Web and in stores.   Pros   Cons   Okay~ I'll assume we all have heard of paracord. Now real paracord has 7 internal strands which can be so so useful from gear repair to fishing to the limits of your imagination. 550 paracord should hold 550lbs also!   We had emergency egress units where it was just a hook or carabiner a figure 8 and 550 cord we all had tactical belts that have the emergency loop where you can hook up too. It is some mighty handy stuff and a million ways to carry it such as replace your boot laces with it and anywhere that has lacing on your gear.   My ARK knife I carry around my neck I used paracord instead of the ball chain they provided. Bracelets~ necklaces~ key chains. It's a vital piece of gear and you should always make sure you get military grade or at the least military spec (million spec may just be meeting the bare minimum of what is military acceptable).   Either way watch what you're buying and be aware of its limits.
890,edelweiss,axis-10.3,4.0,   This was my first rope and~ I think~ a very good one for that purpose~ but not much else. It's proven super durable over several seasons but has a high weight per meter that makes it as heavy as my 70m Sterling Velocity 9.8mm. Superb value including double dry treatment and a pretty decent rope bag.   Pros   Cons   I bought my Edelweiss Axis 10.3mm rope in 2010 as my first climbing rope. I've used it for hundreds of sport and trad climbs including multipitch routes and despite its glaring drawbacks of weight and feel~ I still have a soft spot for it and break it out for any hangdog day~ beginner top-rope fest~ or meandering trad climb.   It's never frayed much despite running over rock in undesirable situations. This thing has seemed pretty bombproof for a rope. I think it's a no-brainer for a first rope because it's tough as nails~ treated~ under $150 and has its own usable bag (which will eventually fall apart but hey~ free bag.)   Weight won't really matter as you start out~ but strong confidence in your line is critical and it will still be in good enough shape to be your 'B' rope in a few seasons when you eventually upgrade.
891,wild-country,helium-clean-wire-quickdraw,5.0,   Great draws~ light and easy to clip.   Pros   Cons   These are my favorite draws. They're light~ and the keyless wiregate makes cleaning overhanging routes a breeze.   Unlike a lot of light biners on the market the gate opens wide enough to make clipping a breeze. 
892,wild-country,helium-clean-wire-quickdraw,5.0,   Got these at backcountry.com with a 25% off coupon code. These are some pricey draws if you pay full retail. These babies are very very light~ almost too light. They took some getting used to after years of old ABC and Stubai draws.     The keyless notch on the red clip biner is great for not getting the rope snagged. The full size red clip biner also has a rubber o ring attached to the sling so it will not move. For sport climbing you barely notice they are on your harness~ I also carry about 6 of these when I'm trad climbing for clipping nuts or using them as extenders.    The only issue I've experienced is the biners have really gotten scrathed and nicked up after a few uses.   Bottom line is these are outstanding draws if you are looking to lighten your load~ especially for trad climbing.   Brandon J.      Bentonville Arkansas
893,dmm,belay-master-2,5.0,"   Excellent product~ vey well designed and made. it's perfect for the job (belaying/rappelling carabiner).   Pros   Cons   Bought the Master 2 exclusively for my tube-type belay device and love it. I've used it now for a few weeks and plan to get a second one soon (backup in case of loss or theft).   The ""pivoting catch"" assures me that my 'biner is locked properly and will not cross load whether belaying or rappelling. It's foolproof because of that folding catch and thus provides visual peace-of-mind for me and the climber—I can lock it and forget about it.   I've read elsewhere that the folding catch is a PITA~ but I don't see that at all. It's what it is and that's what I wanted. I have no problem opening and closing that folding catch. If you want~ you can easily take it off if you don't like it.   And this being made by a UK company also gives me peace-of-mind. It seems to be well-made and easily cleaned if it gets a little dusty or whatever else. I like it :-)   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Update May 31~ 2015:   I saw this top-rope anchor 'biner~ cross loaded yesterday at a local crag—it was fully loaded when I took this picture. The climbers were shocked when I showed it to them in my camera. This is the sort of thing for which I bought the DMM Belay Master 2~ in addition to belay use.   (Full disclosure: I have no affiliation with DMM or any other manufacturer.)"
894,black-diamond,oval-wire-carabiner,5.0,   Caution: I DON'T CLIMB. So if you're looking for a review of this product based on its use as a climbing accessory~ you won't find it here.       I bought these carabiners for use as an accessory biner. They only cost a couple dollars more than the cheap accessory biners~ so I thought the extra $ was worth it to know that I'll probably never come up with a way to destroy them.       I recommend these for use as a general use biner for attaching things to your pack or belt~ and for making a simple pulley system to either hang a bear bag~ or pull your canoe up a steep bank.          Pros   Cons   This biner weighs 45g. It's lighter than many~ but not as light as some of the newer lightweight biners. But as usual~ if you want to shave a few more grams off your pack~ you're going to spend a little more.   $6!!! I went in to the store to buy 1~ but at this price~ I bought 3. This will allow me to...       This biner is rated for climbing~ and has a breaking strength of 23KN. A conversion tool on the internet told me that 23KN = 5170 lbs. So... when you take the breaking strength in KN and convert it to lbs~ then multiply it by the 550 lbs paracord that I use for everything~ and subtract the hypotenuse from the internal operating temperature of the flux capacitor~ you get this result... I'LL NEVER BREAK THIS THING!    The little chores and convenience tasks I have planned for this thing will never come close to reaching its full potential. If this biner was a teenager~ he'd feel completely bored and un-challenged~ which sucks if it's a teenager that you're camping with~ but is pretty great if it's a biner that you're camping with.   The gate on this biner is wide~ and will easily accommodate the handle of a coffee mug~ a water bottle~ paracord~ a strap on a pack~ and a bunch of other things.   It's big and clunky. It's too big to be comfortably used as a key ring~ but large enough that it will be easy to use with gloves or mittens on.   When I was picking out this biner~ there were some others that came in some cool fancy colors. This one only comes in silver.   I'll update this review as I use this piece of equipment and find new uses and drawbacks to it.
895,black-diamond,livewire-quickdraw,5.0,   I just bought a rack of 12 of these for Sport~ and i must say they are sweet. A well balanced and smooth clipping draw for the rope and the bolt.   The small changes between these Karbiners in this draw versus the other in BD line are evident in the increased performance of this Quickdraw. the keylock top slides easily onto even manky bolts with small oddly tapped holes~ not that you want to clip those but there are plenty of them out there. On full sized hangers it almost feels like cheating to slide them on.   As for the rope end~ no matter you clipping technique its brilliant~ the shape of the basket makes those risky clips where you try to finesse the rope in feel solid. all that performance matched to a thick dogbone which although excellent for French Aid~ really excels at stopping the draw from twisting~ a consistent head ache with thin Dynex or other thin dogbones. which even in the somewhat short 12CM length still twist consistently at that dicey run out clip.   As for Trad~ A draw is a draw~ but these are much larger and heavier than the Camp Nano23~ BD OZ~ Wild Country Astro~ or DMM Phantom draws~ all of which offer light weight for the ounce saving trad climber.   However for sport~ you can't do better than the LiveWire.
896,petzl,delta,5.0,   The Petzl Delta Link provides a 25kN working load at a mere 5.29 oz. It serves for multiple connection points in a Frog Ascending System. Lightweight~ tough~ and reliable.   Pros   Cons   I use these for a number of applications—mostly climbing. They are an essential part of of a Frog Ascending system for rope climbing. One is used as the connection point between my Petzl Ascension ascender and the footloop. The other is used to attach my chest ascender (Petzl Croll) to the chest harness.   With the triangular shape~ there is no risk of crossloading. So you maintain the full working strength of the link at all time.   I own several of these~ and I find some of them screw open easily~ while others are really frustrating. I actually carry a small crescent wrench on my gear loop in case I find myself in a bind.   Other applications include using it to hang my hammock and store heavy gear in the rafters of my garage.
897,petzl,william-ball-lock,5.0,   This carabiner~ the Petzl William Ball-lock is the metal sleeve successor to the plastic-sleeved ball-lock. This is my primary locking carabiner~ which I use with belay devices~ with munters (it is an HMS~ designed to take munters readily~ even on double ropes)~ and many other situations. The action is quick and easy with one hand - just push the ball on the sleeve and twist~ then release and it locks automatically (do a squeeze check to be sure~ of course~ as with all lockers).    I did find in Antarctica that in the cold (-30 and below)~ it was sometimes a bit sluggish. I attribute this to getting condensation into the sleeve and ball while in the tent~ which then froze. Working it several times seemed to free it up. I haven't had the problem at temperatures above freezing. And it has worked very well in a couple of hanging changeovers at rappel anchors. The biggest advantage over screwlocks is that the rope can run against the sleeve and not unscrew the sleeve.   I do find the metal-sleeve version a bit more awkward than the older plastic sleeve version with gloves (the black plastic~ which is the equivalent). I wish there were an equivalent to the old yellow plastic version which stayed unlocked until twisted shut - this is more convenient when setting up belays or autoblock backups~ but of course requires a deliberate action to lock~ where both the black plastic and the current metal sleeve versions lock automatically. 
898,black-diamond,neutrino,5.0,   Lightweight. Strong. Reliable. What else do you need?   Pros   This is a great little product. I don't know if there are lighter full-size~ full strength carabiners out there~ but these are fantastic. Obviously the way you use the carabiner is going to change your opinion of them~ but for hammock camping and general campsite use~ they're fantastic.   The biggest drawing point is the weight.  I think if my 30 L bag were filled with these~ I wouldn't notice.  And so~ they double as a means to hang stuff off your pack as you hike without much added weight.   Now~ most carabiners are easy to use~ and so it SHOULD be that these are easy to use and~ in fact~ they are.  They work the way a biner's supposed to work.  They're strong.  I haven't had the need to test the carabiner's weight force limits~ but I haven't given it a second thought before laying down in my hammock.  I'm always confident that~ assuming I'm using the carabiner the way I'm supposed to~ it's going to hold me.   Again~ great product.
899,black-diamond,oz,4.5,   The Oz carabiner is a small carabiner that can be used in sport~ trad~ and alpine climbing. It's lightweight but has a decent gate opening making it more functional than other small carabiners.    Pros   Review   The Oz carabiner is a good all-around biner. It’s not the lightest out there nor does it have the largest gate opening (22mm) but it works well and I’ve always found Black Diamond wire gates easy to clip. The new Oz has a wire hood design making it keylock like the Petzl Ange S but is the cheaper of the two. It also comes in multiple colors to match the Black Diamond Cams.   Small Carabiner Overview   There are a handful of small~ full strength carabiners on the market from 19 grams to 28 grams. Small carabiners are light in weight but generally have a smaller gate opening making clipping the rope more difficult (especially if you have large fingers). For that reason~ some carabiners are better for racking gear or using on the bolt end of a quick draw than using for the rope end of a quick draw or on an alpine draw.   The lightest carabiners on the market are the Edelrid NineteenG~ CAMP Nano 22 and the Metolius FS Mini. The NineteenG and FS Mini have a 17 mm gate opening which is TINY. I used my buddy‘s FS Mini quickdraw once and while I did manage to clip my rope in~ I was cursing the entire time. Personally~ I’d use the NineteenG and FS Mini for racking gear or on the bolt end of a quickdraw only. The FS mini comes in multiple colors making it good for racking cams. The Nano 22 also comes in many colors but has a larger gate opening~ 21mm. This is my personal favorite and is the most affordably priced lightweight carabiner.   In the 27-28 gram range~ the gate openings get larger and are more usable. There are also a couple of small carabiners with a keylock which makes the gate harder to snag. The oz comes in a rack pack with multiple colors. Note that the original Oz did not come with the hoodwire technology so it was not keylock.
900,edelrid,pure-slider,4.5,   It's an easy to use and lightweight autolocker~ perfect for a more secure alpine sling or to use in anchoring.   Pros   Cons   I bought four of these mainly to use for anchoring and having secure carabiners for whatever I need them for.   I can easily open them with one hand by putting the spine in my palm~ and using my middle finger to push the slider down and open the gate. There could potentially be a scenario where a rope or rock can do this as well~ but you'd have to pretty much purposefully place it in a situation where that could happen.   Opening it on a rope is potentially a plus if it's really cold out and you have gloves on~ you can just slide and clip.   That said~ some pictures of the slider look as if the mechanism is somewhat recessed~ but the ones I got are most definitely not recessed.   I've noticed that sometimes the mechanism sticks ever so slightly~ though I think it's mainly the gate is just getting caught on some sand or something on the nose. It hasn't realistically affected usability for me.   They're almost half the weight of a Black Diamond Rocklock which is real neat-o. Crazy what science gets you nowadays.   Other than that it's an auto locking offset-D carabiner~ it's rated to whatever you need it to be. It comes in three colors—blue~ green~ and silver—and it impresses your friends because it's fancy new tech.
901,black-diamond,posiwire-quickdraw,4.5,   Easy clipping and an extremely reliable draw. What more is there to say?   Pros   Cons   The fact that draws have very minimal moving parts makes for a reliable piece of equipment~ but a piece of equipment that is so important that it must be made well enough to not fail on you. I can say that I have yet to have a problem with these draws. I used to use Petzl Spirits but saw a set of these for a sweet price and decided to go for it. I do not regret that decision. The Posiwires are now my go to draw!   Black Diamond advertises a simple and hard-working product and deliver on that promise. Clipping is never an issue (unless you back-clip and in that case you shouldn't be climbing if that is even a problem) and I never feel as if I'm fumbling to get a draw off my harness. The gate action works as if I've just ordered them from BD. Smooth and effortless~ I never feel uneasy about taking a fall.   A 6-pack of Posiwires weighs roughly 1 pound 6 ounces. That to me is incredible. Such a valuable piece of equipment that does is job and keeps you safe for a weight that won't break your back when on those longer climbs.   All-in-all I couldn't speak more highly of such a well made product. If you're unsure~ go with the Posiwires - you won't be sorry.
902,dmm,revolver,4.5,"   The Revolver deserves to be a lot more popular. Its ostensible exorbitant price is misleading as the 'biner will almost certainly pay for itself in extended rope life if you do much toproping and/or lowering.   What it is:      A carabiner with a rolling bearing in the basket. This bearing greatly reduces biner/rope friction.   Advantageous uses:   Top roping and lowering. I haven't seen any data on this issue~ but my gut feeling is that regular use of the Revolver in this capacity would at least double the life of a rope which is subjected to a lot of this one-pitch action.   Clip in point for directional pieces. Allows use of a short runner on a directional.   Clip in point for high rope drag potential pieces such as at the start of a traverse or downclimb.   Clip in point for a the ""fall piece"" when working a route. Pulling oneself back up to the high point is much easier when the pulley point is a Revolver.   Doubles as a pulley in those situations where one would be handy -- hauling~ crevasse rescue.   Disadvantages:        Expensive (but you probably don't need more than one or two on your rack) and relatively heavy. Also~ it so reduces systemic friction that a light belayer could have trouble controlling a heavy climber; in this situation either anchor the belayer or don't use a Revolver.   The side of the basket~ immediately adjacent to the bearing seems to wear more quickly than you would want it to. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact the the 'biner is thicker at this point.   DMM is set to release locking Revolvers which will be even more expensive and heavier~ but that much safer~ esp. for topropng."
903,camp,photon-wire-straight-gate,4.0,   The Camp Photon wire gate carabiner is the lightest full size carabiner in the world and has an extremely large gate opening for easy clipping.   Pros   Review   The Camp Photon carabiner is amazingly light weighing in at 29 grams. It also has a one of the largest gate openings at 28mm for the straight gate and 29mm for the bent gate. I currently have 12 Photon Wire Bent Gate carabiners on the rope end of my quickdraws and they are noticeably lighter than the hotwires I replaced while still being easy to clip. There have been reports of the Photons having sticky gates but I haven’t had any issues after year and a half of use.       Large Carabiner Overview   Full size carabiners have also come down in weight in the last few years. The lightweight carabiners with the largest gate opening are the following. The Camp Photon is the lightest at 29g and has a large gate opening. They are also reasonable priced and the straight gate comes in multiple colors.   The Wild Country Helium is award winning and one of the first carabiners to use I-beam construction to reduce weight. It is one of the most expensive carabiners out there. Finally~ there are a few new carabiners from Cypher and ClimbX that have good specs and are affordably priced. With that said~ I haven’t had any experience with either one.
904,metolius,gatekeeper-locking-carabiner,3.5,   Does well at keeping the carabiner from rotation while belaying. The spin lock is OK but doesn't turn as smoothly as others. The paint on the carabiner wears off almost immediately~ and grooves from the rope appear faster than expected.   Pros   Cons   This is a nice design for preventing your carabiner from rotating while belaying. It attaches to the harness more easily than the other gatelock style carabiners I've tried.   However~ the green paint wears off from the rope almost immediately. Mine has no paint left where the ropes run after two days of use. Additionally~ grooves wear into the carabiner from the rope faster than expected. I had to stop using this carabiner after two years of once or twice a week use due to the grooves from the rope getting deep enough that I was concerned about their edges against the rope and about the effect on the strength of the carabiner.   Experience   I have used this as my belay biner for the past two years. I usually use it once or twice a week. I use it for cragging as well as for multi-pitch. 
905,omega-pacific,standard-locking-d,3.0,   The Locking D is a decent 'biner at a good price. It does not provide all the [unnecessary] bells and whistles of some other carabiners~ but it is going to provide a climber exactly what he needs without breaking the bank.   Pros   Cons   I use these every day on my Adventure Challenge course. They are a dependable aluminum carabiner at a low cost. I primarily use them on my climbing gym wall and on my outdoor tower.   I do not use them in my personal gear~ because of the cons. The gate is pretty small~ making it difficult to clip in with gloved hands. There are lighter 'biners on the market. And I suspect they wouldn't hold up to the abuse I put my 'biners through while caving (To be fair~ I haven't put that suspicion to the test.).   If you are looking for a 'biner for the local climbing gym or basic rope work~ this is a good one to use. If your needs are a greater (change overs~ rope transfers~ etc)~ I'd look elsewhere.   
906,black-diamond,rocklock-magnetron,1.5,   Large auto locking carabiner. Not worth this girl's money.    Pros   Cons   I purchased this biner because of its size and the magnetic catch. I like a larger biner for a double line munter (as a backup plan in case something goes wrong with my Reverso). I thought it may pose a problem for ice but that was not the issue.   The magnetic catch is not an ergonomic fit for me. I have small to medium woman's hands and when I reach for release it is just out of my grasp. Only by millimetres! What a pain in the butt! I then have to release it without gripping the full biner in one hand. If you are a climber~ you know that's a gong show! — and has the potential to be unsafe.   For now~ I've problem solved this by putting this piece of gear in time out.     For men — it's a very cool piece of kit designed more for you :)  I recommend it as the magnetic catch is cool and performs ok as long as it doesn't ice up.
907,simond,spider-screwgate,5.0,   Lightweight~ excellent screwgate locker that has a perfectly shaped nose to make clipping extremely easy. The best locking beiner for personal anchor systems at the top of a long difficult route.   Pros   Cons   This carabiner is the best I have used to attach a personal anchor system at the top of a route. The nose is shaped in a way that it is quite open (bent out) compared to other screwgate lockers~ so clipping is extremely easy. The diameter of the carabiner is around  a medium sized thickness. Since the body of the carabiner is round and not an I-beam construction you do lose some strength~ but the diameter is great if you have to clip multiple pieces of gear onto a single anchor. The carabiner is fairly light for a screwgate locker so you barely even feel it on your harness.   One of the most important factors to me when selecting a carabiner is the spring mechanism. A lot of carabiner manufacturers are using plastic spring mechanisms. I do not like this as I have heard of the spring mechanisms becoming brittle in cold weather. The Simond Spider Screwgate uses a metal spring~ this is preferred as a metal spring I believe is more durable.   I have used this carabiner for personal anchor systems in the Canadian Rockies on single pitch sport climbing routes. 
908,omega-pacific,jake-3-stage-quik-lok,4.0,"   The Omega Pacific Jake is a big~ throaty 'biner. The offset gate is a great innovation that makes clipping in much easier than a standard ""D"" or ""Pear-shaped"" carabiner.    Pros   Cons   My feelings about this 'biner have evolved since I originally posted a review on it. My original~ 3-star review focused on the ""backwards"" feel of the offset gate. However~ over time I have come to realize that~ like all gear~ experience is key. Today~ I feel the pros definitely outweigh the cons.   The Jake is a ""throat-y~"" 3-stage auto locking aluminum 'biner. Even for a standard pear-shaped 'biner~ the Jake is big. The large throat makes this an ideal carabiner for Munter hitch belays.      The offset gate gives a lot of clearance to get the 'biner clipped in. I have personally found this 'biner to be what I need when trying to get past other equipment on my harness (caving harnesses have more equipment attached to them than a standard seat harness).      Cons:   My primary rope work is in caves~ where grit and grime can often prevent an auto lock 'biner from completely closing. Also~ I find the Jake to be difficult to operate while wearing gloves. This is a huge factor when you're 100' off the ground and trying to change over from ascent to rappel or when transferring to another rope.   Above: Me climbing out of Rumbling Falls Cave (200').Below: Same picture zoomed in on Omega Jake 'biner.   Over all~ it's a decent 'biner~ but not my favorite. The auto locking feature is probably best in less gritty environments. I still use the Jake in above ground practice~ but depend on screw gate 'biners when caving."
909,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,"   Besides being quite lightweight~ the ATC-Guide is a very nice evolution from the ATC.  The ability to belay directly off of the anchors is so great that you will go ""wow"" if you have never belayed a second off of the anchors.  It will lock off~ and that really helps in keeping the second safe.   Pros   Cons   It's easy to incorporate it into the anchor system~ and it's quite easy to rappel from either double or single line rappels."
910,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,   The BD ATC-Guide is a tube-style belay/rappel device with friction ridges. In this respect it is very much like its predecessor~ the BD ATC-XP~ and innumerable other similar devices. What makes the ATC-Guide unique is the addition of two loops of aluminum. What this addition achieves is threefold:   1) For belaying a second~ the ATC-Guide can now be set-up to brake automatically~ much like the Petzl Reverso/Reversino. Note that all normal belay attention/precautions apply~ but just that there is now a backup to normal belay.   2) The additional loops of aluminum functions as an effective heat sink~ allowing this device to run cooler than comparable tube-style devices.   3) The additional loop of aluminum is helpful for setting up a Z-rig rappel~ which greatly increases friction. This is applicable mostly for canyoneering~ where single-stranded rappels on wet and thin (9mm or less) rope necessitates that level of friction.   It has been noted that user feedback for the ATC-XP convinced Black Diamond to tone-down the friction ridges for the ATC-Guide. Whereas the ATC-XP has been said to have ~3 times the friction of the plain ATC~ the ATC-Guide is said to have ~2 times the friction.  In any case~ the friction ridges still provide quite a bit of friction to the point that I prefer rappelling without using them in normal conditions. But it is certainly nice to have should the need arise.   There isn't much more to say except for the fact that the device works as advertised~ with no obvious faults to speak of. It is good enough to go unnoticed~ which is actually high praise.
911,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,"   So you have that buddy that's reaching walrus territory. I mean he is really packing on the flub~ that asks you...""How bout a climb this weekend?"" With the Black Diamond ATC Guide your skinny ass doesn't have to worry. Putting the brakes on the walrus.... no prob! Love you ATC Guide!    Pros   Cons"
912,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,   Great overall product~ performs like it should with no snags or problems whatsoever.   Pros   Cons   This is a truly straightforward device that can be used by the most novice belayers~ like all other belay devices of its kind~ the biggest advantages it has are: first~ the high friction mode~ which will allow the rope to lock even under heavy strain without the need of making excessive amounts of effort on the belayers side; second~ the ability to anchor it and belay a seconding climber with ease.   I've used the ATC Guide for both indoor and outdoor rock climbing for over a year without a single problem. Its ease of use and reliability use after use make me give it five stars without a single doubt in my mind.
913,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,   As someone who does most of my climbing and rappeling with Scouts~ the ATC-Guide is a godsend.  It's easy to use and explain and the friction ridges really lock down a rope even when a novice kid is using it.  This sure saves me a lot of skipped heart beats and grey hair.    Most of the equipment I use is signed out from whatever facility or camp I am instructing at but I always bring along a couple of BD ATC-Guides to use.
914,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,   Awesome~ the ATC-Guide is the best belay device on the market.
915,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,   I have tried every belay device on the market that was designed to be used in an auto-block situation. The BD ATC-Guide is my go-to device. I use it exclusively when climbing for fun or when guiding.     The single connection point is easier to use and more stable than the B-52~ and the thick aluminum lasts longer than the thin material of the Reverso. Petzl has improved on the design of the Reverso~ but the BD ATC-Guide is still a better device. It can be used in low or high friction mode (something Petzl used in their update of the Reverso) and also as an ascender.  
916,black-diamond,atc-guide,5.0,   I've used many different belay devices~ and this is the best. It's intuitive like the ATC and other similar belay devices but this one is special because of its many other features~ the best being the ridges on one side that offer more friction. The other two loops on it act similarly to the Reverso by Petzl so you can belay from your anchor instead of your harness~ but when you have it set up this way the ATC-XP Guide becomes a self-locking belay device. That last little hole is used to tie some webbing through it and the carabiner because when it self-locks~ you'll need the leverage to unlock it.    So overall I believe this ATC makes all other tube style belay devices obsolete because it's intuitive~ versatile and smooth. 
917,black-diamond,atc,4.5,"   This style of belay devices is named after this product. It's the Q-tip of climbing.    Pros   Cons   I think my ATC came with a big belay locking carabiner back when I bought it. This was my first belay device ever. I learned it in just under a minute~ my kids know how to use it~ and I am sure that~ with a little extra effort~ my dog could belay with it in a pinch.    The whole class of tube-style belay devices are called collectively~ by many climbers~ ATCs. That speaks a lot for its popularity. I have had salty climbers tell me that the ATC contributed to the death of the figure eight device in sport climbing more than anything else. Yes~ I know some people still love sport climbing on the eight; some people still listen to 8-tracks too.   I've had people threaten to call the police on me for not insisting that I train my kids on a grigri because it's criminal to let kids use something that isn't auto-locking. I'm not kidding. They say~ ""What if they let go of the rope and the climber falls?"" To which I answer~ ""They don't drop the rope.""    I think though that if I can't trust them to pay attention to a climber while they belay then they have no business at the crag other than as a spectator. Truly~ there is a time and place for auto-locking devices~ but for sport climbing it's overkill. Besides~ grigri is heavy~ more complex for kids to master~ and costs ten times what an ATC does.    Since buying the ATC-XP though the ATC stays on my gear loops until I need to rappel. Does it get hot during rappels? Yes~ so go slower and keep it from flopping around your short shorts after rapping; who wears those at the crag anyway? You're supposed to rapp in gloves anyway. If it had as much grip as an ATC-XP I'd still use it to belay 100% of the time~ but the beauty of the plain-jane ATC is that the kids never get it backwards and it's always aligned to their strong braking hand.    I own the ATC-XP and the original. If I end up doing more technical mountaineering or trad climbing I'll get the ATC Guide but till then~ I'm good."
918,black-diamond,atc,5.0,"   Belayed thousands of people on this tube.   Pros   Cons   This belay tube device does exactly what it's intended to do for a great price. I have been using BD's ATC for 15 years. I have belayed thousands of people on my high rope challenge course~ and I've never had a problem with one of these. No~ they don't last forever~ and you do have to replace them over time~ but that's with any piece of equipment.   Companies continue to try and come up with the perfect belay device. Frankly~ I feel some of these ""improvements"" make for lazy belayers—creating a false sense of security by saying it will lock if the belayer makes a mistake.   If you don't know how to use one of these devices~ find someone who does. No one should be belaying without some qualified training. Most climbing gyms and adventure challenge programs offer classes.   "
919,black-diamond,atc,4.0,   Very easy to learn and get used to~ but you really have to be attentive as a belayer (which should be the case~ regardless of the system in place). due to its simplicity~ you are sure to get consistent performance (have tried 3 different units of this model~ one of which is old).   Same goes when you use it to rappel. Very smooth~ never got me worried~ which makes me pay attention more the locking/braking parts of the system.   Reason why only 4 stars is because can't be setup as locking when you are belaying seconds. For this~ you might want to check out the ATC Guide or Petzl Reverso.
920,black-diamond,atc,4.5,   Very easy to use. I have used it for the past three years. It is very easy to see if you have it threaded correctly. Easy to use on a double line rappel. It does get hot when rappelling.    Bottom line I would buy it again. 
921,edelrid,mega-jul,5.0,   This device does everything. I have not encountered a single situation in climbing that the Mega Jul could not handle smoothly and easily. It can and will replace basically anything else you currently use as a belay/rappel device.   Pros   Cons   EASE OF USE:   Everything that this device claims to do~ it does. It is perfect for belaying a leader~ feeding out rope effortlessly. When used for toproping~ the tuber-mode is still smooth and just as simple as your ATC. Belaying a second is also very easy~ and the diagrams on the side of the device allows for anyone to use it~ even your partner who is new to the device.   That said~ I would not recommend going out and relying entirely on this device without receiving some instruction online first. Though it is in no way complicated~ it is different enough from a standard device to require some background instruction.   FEATURES:   The Mega Jul has everything it needs to maximize its features~ and nothing else. The tube openings are big enough for any standard rope and are very smooth; the large loop on top of the device is for belaying a second~ and if you follow the simple instructions~ this is effortless; the small loop on the nose of the device perfectly fits a keynose biner~ and will make rappelling an easy task for you~ as the auto-lock can be tricky otherwise; the large green thumb loop is comfortable and intuitive~ at no point have I felt I needed belay gloves (though I never used them in the first place). I really can't think of any situation you may encounter in any type of climbing where this device would fall short.CONSTRUCTION & DURABILITY:   Every component aside from the plastic thumb loop is steel~ which will certainly last longer than the standard aluminum devices that are most common. So far mine has survived consistent use (3-4 times a week)~ and even the stickers on the side have lasted through a rough trip to Joshua Tree~ with lots of scraping and scratching that hardly marred the surface.CONDITIONS:   I've used my Mega Jul for sport~ trad~ toproping~ and multipitch climbs many times since I got it about three months ago. I've rappelled a good amount with it as well~ and have seen no change in the quality and sturdiness of the device.   BOTTOM LINE:   This is the best and most valuable piece of climbing gear I have purchased since my rope. I would definitely consider it an ideal addition to any gear rack.   UPDATE 2/2016:   I just encountered the first situation this device did not handle in spades. My friend has a stiff~ well-used rope that we were using to get up a multipitch in Joshua Tree (Right On~ for those curious)~ and I found the Mega Jul very difficult to use with the rope. So much so~ I eventually just used my backup ATC instead.   The only issue was that the rope was not feeding smoothly through it~ so it was just somewhat inefficient~ not in any way dangerous. I still rapped with the Mega Jul~ because it's just so darn nice.
922,edelrid,mega-jul,4.0,   + : Blocking device~ comfortable in one-pitch routes and indoor   - : One more operation to do when belaying a second   Pros   Cons   After a few days to get used to the blocking system~ it is really great (the very first times~ the lowering is a bit difficult and irregular). It is still possible to lower fast~ and when rappelling~ no more need of a Prussik.   Nice design and lightweight.   Seems quite solid even though lightweight. I am using it almost every day for three months and nothing to regret.
923,petzl,stop,4.5,   Works best with flexible rope~ the Stop locks down on the rope if your hand comes off the lever.  Safe device with a long history of use in Europe for caving.   Pros   Cons   I used the Stop in Europe to descend various caves over the course of a month. It is a good device~ and allows for a free hand to clip into a belay station on rappel. This is very nice since the ropes in Europe are generally re-anchored multiple times on a rappel.     It is also fairly compact and lightweight compared to a stainless rappel rack. Unfortunately~ I don't get to use it much~ as most U.S. caving ropes are stiff and don't work well in the device.     Tip: Make sure to close the device for storage or while caving so you don't accidentally bend the cover plate.
924,petzl,pirana,4.5,"   Con: Can only be used with certain carabiners.   Pro: Because of snug carabiner fit~ it is almost impossible for the 'biner to flip and become side-loaded.   I got one of these to keep in my tree climbing gear bag. I wish I could use it for rescue~ but it doesn't have the NFPA's stamp of approval (yet). As with all gear~ practice in a safe environment with this device before using it in the ""real"" world.   This is NOT just another figure 8 descending device.  It is a multi-friction device originally designed for caving~ but has found favor in almost any sport or profession that utilizes rope.   The best feature of this device is that friction can be added or subtracted while the device is in use. This is accomplished by wrapping the rope around various horns and/or bars. Additionally~ there are 3 ways to rig the Piranha to match the weight of the user~ size of rope~ or compensate for extra weight such as a heavy pack or even another person during a rescue operation. For safety~ it can be rigged without removing it from the harness - None of these things can be accomplished with with an ATC or an ""8""."
925,petzl,grigri,5.0,"   I think it's best to learn using a ATC-type devise~ but once you've mastered the basic technique move on to the grigri!  It's right at home when belaying someone heavier than you or when your forearms are bumpin from the route you just spent 10 minutes sending and your partner wants an immediate go to show you a ""different way"".  Lowering takes a little time to learn smoothly as you can't feel it as much as an ATC but you catch on pretty quick.  If you're still worried~ Petzl makes a biner with a friction spur on the side that you clip the rope into when lowering for that extra bit of stopping power (I think the biner is called a frieno or something).  Both are expensive ($95+$45 .. yikes!) but you'll blow people's mind with your belay set up~ trust me."
926,petzl,grigri,4.0,   I had mine for years and used it for many purposes~ mostly belaying. If I don't know the person that belays me I prefer to use the grigri and it makes me feel safer because it works every time! I also used it for solo top rope and have caught dozens of falls~ even without my hands on the rope (not recommended per manual).   Pros   Cons   Overall this is a great piece of gear that is built to last. I have used it for lead climb belaying~ top rop belaying~ and rappelling. It has never failed me and has held my life many times.   Top rope belay and rappel is easy and convenient with the auto lock feature that doesn't harm the rope. Belaying a lead climber requires technique to feed the rope quickly and smoothly without engaging the brakes that can interfere.  Initially~ it is common to find people not properly using it. For this reason~ I suggest learning how to use it properly.   I've had mine for two years and I trust it more than my ex wife :-P
927,petzl,grigri,3.5,   It's a heavy device but it's auto locking. I use it exclusively on sport climbing single pitch routes and gives me peace of mind when my belayer has less climbing experience.
928,petzl,grigri,3.0,"   Not a good choice for the beginner. I used one of these during a belaying class and it seems like the obvious choice for the beginning climber. It's automatic. How much easier can it get?     In reality~ I found it rather difficult to control descents as compared to the old trusty ATC belay-plate type device. On top of that~ I think the fact that it's ""automatic"" causes the beginner to become a bit complacent.   I'm sure this is a great device in the right hands on the right application. However~ for the beginner inclined to spend the extra money thinking they're getting something great~ I recommend saving the cash and buying an ATC for their first belaying device."
929,petzl,grigri,5.0,   If you are climbing any kind of lead this is the belay device to have. It makes life so much better on those long hard routes.
930,petzl,grigri,5.0,   I would rate this product with 10 stars if I could. Simply put~ DO NOT LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!!!!!!!   Happy and safe summit!
931,petzl,grigri,0.5,   NOT GOOD for BEGINNERS.    Pros   Cons   Easy to confuse the release with a brake and drop the climber. I have seen three climbers dropped with a Grigri. One went to the hospital. All three were belayed by beginners who were properly trained~ attentive~ and thought they were doing right.   I have only seen one climber dropped by someone using an ATC. He was not properly trained and was not using correct technique. I would NOT allow a beginner to belay me with a Grigri.
932,cassin,piu-2,3.5,   It is a good belay device~ with a modern and well designed look. It has all the features you may expect from a versatile piece of gear. The go-to item~ for people trying to avoid the Petzl Reverso wave.    Pros   Cons   It is a good belay device~ with a modern and well designed look. It has all the features you may expect from a versatile piece of gear. The go to item~ for people trying to avoid the Petzl Reverso wave.    Positive aspects: To take a head point start in this review~ I would like to take up its primary advantages: It’s a Petzl Reverso copy~ so you know it will do well. The design of the Piu 2 is just a bit different~ and apart from the brand~ you would not even notice the difference~ Until you take a more closer look and make a side by side comparison.     This only adds up to the advantage of the Piu 2~ just because you know it comes well equipped with all the features you would expect.   It can be used in the normal way as a standard belay device~ threading a bite of climbing rope through one of the two shafts of this device~ and clipping a locking karabiner to the cord~ the steel cable~ as well as the belay loop and securing it.   Doing so~ you can benefit from the tapered sides on the hand-braking part. They are cunningly designed~ accommodate for multiple sizes of rope~ and make it possible to imply friction only when downward pulling the braking strand of rope. The upward pull of this strand of rope is in no way limited by these tapered sides~ but they are there in order to optimize the braking strength to cope with the lead climber’s fall.   The next big thing to mention about this device is that it can be turned upside down in another climbing situation to create a self-braking (auto-locking) belay device. The reason why you would do a thing like that is in the event that you climbed as a lead climber to the top of a pitch and then it becomes your partner’s turn to start climbing and yours to start belaying from above. There are different ways to manage the belay from above~ but the reversed mode makes it convenient and safe due to the auto-locking feature.   In order to set up the belay device properly~ you will need a bombproof anchor (consisting of at least two connected and secured attachment points to the rock) that is located slightly above your waist for comfortable rope management. You will still feed a bite of rope through one of the two shafts and clipping the rope and the steel cable with a locking karabiner as you did previously. The only difference is that you do not attach yourself to the system~ but instead~ you will use a second locking karabiner to attach the device to the anchor point using its big rounded hole in front. This tilts the device in a vertical position with the strand leading back to the climber on top and the braking strand underneath. This jams the rope tight in the tapered slot to provide the friction to catch a fall. The big round hole in the device is big enough to comfortable be attached with any type of rated locking karabiner. As a belayer it remains your job to keep the slack out of the system.   To lower a climber in this setup you either use a piece of accessory cord or another locking karabiner and attach it to the smaller hole on the bottom to tilt the device back. This is operated with only one hand. Tilting the device backwards will reduce the amount of friction on the brake strand due to the fact that the loaded climbers strand isn’t pushing it directly down into those tapered friction grooves. It is only obvious that you need your other hand on the braking strand and it has to be backed up with some form of prusik or other friction knot and a stopper knot in the end. Note that~ at all time you~ as the belayer~ will need to be double-clipped to the rock in one way or another in order to be safe~ but that’s considered as mandatory.   Another feature of this product is that it can be used to rappel in a very efficient way. To set this up~ you need to be on the top of a pitch (attached to a bombproof anchor while converting the system)~ using a rope that is long enough so it touched the ground and on the other end fixed to the anchor point in an appropriate manner. The next thing to do is to feed the rope~ as if it were a normal belay~ with your anchor point at the end of the lead strand and an additional prusik knot or other friction knot on the brake strand of the rope~ attaching it to either your belay loop or even a leg strand of your harness will do. Then clip a locking karabiner to the steel cable~ the rope and an additional 30-60cm sling which is attached to your belay loop. The point is to have your hand on the brake strand at all time~ controlling your descend~ with the Piu 2 situated a little bit higher than your belay loop~ remaining well within reach. Depending on your rappel skills and the type of rope/friction knot~ you will have a very smooth descend.   Next up~ it is necessary to talk about the fact that it can manage two different ropes on the same time in of all these situations. It basically means you can climb with twin ropes or with half ropes in the first –normal- setup without any problem. It is only a bit more complicated for the belayer to keep the unnecessary slack out of each cord but still provide the extra bit that is needed to clip into the quickdraws. In the upside down setup you will have the same options~ and in theory even one extra: you can bring two climbers up at the same time using single ropes.    Although I am not an big fan of this technique~ it will work without any risk. The main drawback in using this setup is that~ in the event the highest climber wanders off to one side~ or if the two climbing ropes get crossed~ it is very hard to take slack out properly. It is not a big deal on fairly easy pitches~ but when you manage a belay from above with two simultaneous climbers and the route includes a spicy overhang~ your belay talent gets tested upon.   About two simultaneous climbers in this one device: it is a hassle~ although it is doable. In the normal setup~ when belaying from below~ it can become dangerous when the first lead climber1 takes a fall~ he can hit the second lead climber~ but also you might be pulled toward the first piece of protection. In normal scenarios this isn’t a problem~ but here it might~ because it may result in unwanted slack on the rope of the second climber.  Considering the two simultaneous climbers in the upside down position~ your main restriction would be that you can not lower one climber without a whole lot of rope management to keep the second climber safe and secured   And now back to topic with its rope thickness. It can cope with ropes ranging from 8mm up to 11mm. For the narrow ropes~ such as 8-9mm it doesn’t form any problem because the tapered sides are narrower at the bottom. Such skinny ropes are not the most comfortable to handle when belaying~ but they just have their own specific characteristics. For the most common thicker ropes~ they form no problem when using this device~ even stiff rugged ropes are well manageable by the Piu 2.   When you get to the 11mm cords it will get a little bit tricky to jam those through the holes. One way to bypass this problem in the ordinary regular belay setup~ is to feed the rope (coming from the climber) through the top of the big attachment hole and coming up from below~ through one of the two shafts. Than you can clip you belay loop with a locking karabiner to the steel cable and the bite of rope to finish it off. The main reason for this is that the big attachment hole is way bigger than the two shafts~ reducing the struggle with those thick ropes.   A cool feature is that the steel cable is placed diagonally instead of centered. Looking at the device upright with the big hole on top~ and the steel cable coming out towards you~ it runs from the right side of the big attachment hole down towards the left side of the small hole. This prevents the belay device being pulled sideways~ when loaded. The advantage of this construction makes it a little bit easier to make your right hand the braking hand~ since the rope comes out more to the right~ then to the center.     The negative aspects: One of the dislikes about this product is that the paint and finish wear off in time. On the side of the device there are some safety instructions printed on ‘how to feed the rope through properly’ and how to identify the braking strand. These are actually nothing more than two logos~ one piece of cord in a hand~ and next to it there is a miniature climber sketched. It is not a big deal at all that they become vague~ but nevertheless they are still considered as safety instructions. I think that you will get the principle of using this device correct after about two times~ so I don’t consider it to be a big problem~ but nevertheless the finish and paint show some wear and scratches over time.   However~ the only negative point about this product is that the material for the sheath of the steel cable is not as durable as the rest of the product. It is a hardened black plastic coating to prevent damage to the belay loop~ and to make sure the steel cable never gets caught in the fibers of a climbing rope. After a wile of intensive use~ the black plastic shows some little cracks. Once the sheath begins to crack further~ it is only a matter of time before small bits and pieces of this plastic shell crumble off. It will in no case limit the safety or the strength of the product~ but its clean and nice finish becomes tarnished. Most outdoor stores and equipment shops will not take the item back or give you a refund as for a broken pieces of equipment. It is just something the designers and developers of the Piu 2 might take up in their next revised edition of the Belay device.   Specifications: It weighs 80gr~ so you don’t even notice it on the side of your harness. It is 9cm (3.54”) long~ 4cm (1.57”) wide~ and with the steel cable~ it rises up about 8cm (3.15”). It comes with an unlimited lifetime but only with a tree year warranty. The lifetime as well as the guarantee have specific restrictions in order to comply with EN safety standards.      Conclusion: After all a great product. It does the job well~ and you can be sure it will be a good value for your money. A nifty thing~ opposed to the overwhelming load of Petzl gear on the market~ and above all a multifunctional~ decent and essential piece of equipment in your kit.
933,petzl,reverso,3.5,   For 7 years~ I've used this for all three functions~ belay~ rappel~ and in guide position. Love it!  Except...   Pros   Cons   I've used this device for at least 7 years and do love it. I've taken my time growing into it and will always have one on my harness. I love using it on multi pitches as it is a very fast switch from guide to standard belay as your climber passes.     The drawback is I don't like the release for guide position. Meaning the release when belaying up my climber and (for some reason) there is a need to lower. A small lower of a few centimetres is fine by me but the control for a longer release is not great.   After some experiences this spooks me and I've decided it is not the safest way to lower. So I avoid it. I carry a piece of extra gear to change over to a lowering system and everybody gets out alive - hence the star and a half penalty.   I highly recommend this piece of kit but with caution that a buyer know a little extra when deciding to put this into use.
934,petzl,reverso,3.0,   It covers a good diameter range and it's a solid tool. Light~ easy to use~ multipurpose tool. I use it for alpine climbing and mountaineering when double ropes are needed.   You can belay and rappel with this one and it has an auto block mode for belaying one/two seconds. It has three friction levels.   One minus would be the fact that is difficult to lower the second while in auto blocking mode.
935,mammut,smart,5.0,   Easy to use in a very similar way to a traditional belay plate~ but with added security.   Pros   Cons   I wanted an assisted braking belay device to give my wife more confidence in lead belaying. The Smart is just what I needed as it operates in a very similar way to a traditional belay plate but gives added security of assisted braking.   It's very light to carry and quick and easy to set up with no moving parts to the device. The lowering and paying out action is slightly different to a plate device but not too dissimilar to take too long to learn.   It does not like thick~ well worn climbing centre~ in place top ropes~ but works really well with all of my lead ropes.   I use this with a DMM Belay Master to prevent cross loading and it's a great combination.   We did try a Grigri~ but found to be such a different action to a normal plate that smooth use did not come easily. Perhaps given more time a Grigri would have won us over. At least with the Smart I can get more gear in my luggage allowance!
936,mammut,smart,5.0,   Whether I am leading an Intro to Rock or Ice Day or just out climbing with my friends the Mammut Smart is always with me in all seasons.   It is very easy to use and great because it can be used with one finger (but I wouldn't recommend that). The device doing most of the work in the brake position is great for those cold ice climbing days when it is a little bit harder to grip the rope~ and the release is great.  It takes a couple of times to get used to the release but what belay device doesnt.   I have had most of my friends use it and they all own them now and the ones that don't always want to borrow mine.
937,mammut,smart,4.0,   For my first purchase of a belay device~ I wanted something versatile~ but user-friendly. Having only used the Petzl GriGri in the past~ I needed something light weight and affordable~ functional for both top-rope and leading~ but intuitive for a novice. After discussing the options with some friends at my local REI~ I was excited and most interested in the SMART. When my Dividend came out~ it was mine.   The first time using it at my local climbing gym~ I noticed that there was a learning curve~ but it was very steep. The first thing I noticed is that when the device is new~ it has the tendency to lock when feeding and taking-in rope~ however - IT IS NOT AN AUTO-LOCKING BELAY. There are comments out there that it has this feature~ but I feel it cannot be depended upon to do so.   As our climbing session went on~ (whether wearing-in the device or getting used to its functionality) I found it fed very well and rappelled very smoothly at varying speeds. It held securely when I needed to and arrested falls very easily though dynamically with little pressure needing to be applied.   All-in-all:   -Feeds differently from other belay devices (directly in front of the belayer rather than to the side)~ but is easy to get used-to   -Stops falls quickly but dynamically~ requiring little pressure on the rope to arrest a fall   -Rappels very smoothly at varying speeds   -Easy to learn - could be used by a brand-new climber or expert alike   Overall~ I look forward to years of use out of this device!
938,petzl,grigri-2,4.5,   Great belay device.   Pros   Cons   Ease of use:    Very easy to use.   Difficult for left handers.   Makes belaying more relaxing especially when the leader sepnds heaps of time falling or just hanging around.   Features:   Auto locking belay device.   Construction and Durability:   Very hard wearing. Never heard of one wearing out ever.
939,petzl,grigri-2,4.5,   Excellent auto locking belay device.   Pros   Cons   The Grigri is ubiquitous~ you see them everywhere you go~ and for good reason.  It's just about as good as a belay device can get for toproping and sport climbing.  It's expensive~ but worth the price in the end for the ease of use and the peace of mind.   First~ it's easy to use. It has engraved simple instructions on the side of the device~ and it's easy to see how it works with the locking cam if you pull up on the climber's side of the rope. Just run the rope through in the indicated direction~ swivel the faceplate into place~ lock with a locking biner to your belay loop~ and it's ready to go. The way Petzl has designed it makes it practically impossible to close unless the rope is correctly run through the device. It's a simple device~ really.   Although it was expensive ($74 on sale at REI)~ it lives up to the hype. I'm a beginner rock climber~ and when teaching people or dragging them to the crag with me~ it gives me peace of mind that should their attention lapse when belaying me~ I won't be falling to my death. It's no excuse for lazy belaying or taking someone without proper instruction~ but being on the wall knowing that in the event of a mistake or accident~ the Grigri will auto lock.     Construction is good~ I wish they would have foregone some of the plastic on the device and opted for all metal construction. There's not much plastic on most climbing gear~ and although they've used a decent plastic and in non-load bearing parts~ it just doesn't feel like the most quality piece of equipment. I've used mine quite a bit though~ and banged it on rocks while hanging from my harness~ and it looks like it's holding up fine.  No major complaints.   I've used it for several months~ toproping and sport climbing in mostly hot and dry Utah conditions.  It's been great.  I was on the fence about this~ thinking my ATC was just fine~ and after using it~ it instills just a bit more confidence to whoever is climbing that they are safe~ just another redundancy.  It works well~ and is worth the price absolutely.  Ease of use goes to an ATC~ but overall safety~ I'd give to the Grigri.  It's also great when you're belaying someone who will be hanging on the route a lot~ as you don't have to be providing tension to keep them on belay the entire time.
940,simond,toucan,5.0,   The primary purpose of a belay plate is to stop a falling climber… and most of them do it quite well. The Toucan~ like any other~ does beautifully - as long as the belayer knows what he or she is doing!   When feeding the rope to a lead climber~ the non-load bearing “keeper arm” acts very much like the spring mechanism on traditional “spring” belay plates. By lifting the plate slightly off the belay caribiner~ the stop-and-go jerking that is common with some devices is much easier to control~ thus creating a smoother belay when climbing or rappelling.   Like others of its kind~ the Toucan can belay two following climbers simultaneously~ allowing the belayer to pull slack on one climber while the other climber weights the rope.  The  “keeper arm” gives the Toucan an advantage when in “guide mode.” All you need is a simple sling~ girth hitched to the “keeper arm~” and a slight tug on the device allows for a smooth release of the top-belay.  This built-in feature is not available on any other belay plates.   The Toucan handles rope diameters from 7.5mm to 11mm~ is lightweight~ and has V-slotted edges for increased belay bite.  Additionally~ you’ll be hard-pressed to pay more than $30US for it.   The Toucan is still fairly un-reviewed and less known.  Perhaps Simond felt its’ versatility would sell itself.  If not~ it may not be around long enough to be acknowledged for its superiority among competitors.   Simond offers limited basic information on the varied uses of the device.  Their online diagrams are helpful~ but you are likely to get better information from climbers who have had a chance to use it.   Perhaps the only real disappointment: The Toucan is only available in blue!   James is a writer for the Tucson Climbing Gear Examiner online.

941,fusion,terminal-8,5.0,   I  have had the opportunity to use the Fusion KURA  Rescue 8 while conducting a  climbing and rappelling program for my Boy Scout troop.   The belay device worked flawlessly: First; the shipping department got this to me incredibly fast! It was amazing and the friendliness of the guys at Fusion was great.   Right out of the package it was immediately the envy of all the climbing  crew. Bright red finish and smooth surfaces all around; This piece of gear was manufactured and finished with a very high level of quality and detail.  All the participants wanted to use this rescue-8 because it looked more  substantial and beefier than the other standard eights we used.   This device easily handled 11mm PMI static rope with ease and still had  room (both single line and double line as a fireman's belay.) Again~ the  smooth surfaces were a dream and they treated the ropes very gently. I even  used it as an unconventional belay device (a la sticht plate style) and the inner  diameter of the slot worked perfectly. I also love the elongated ears.   We definitely put Fusion's rescue-8 through its paces and it took all we  gave it and didn't even overheat.  In fact~ if there is one thing (and only one  thing) that I have issue with is the red finish itself: It does not appear to  be anodized and wears quickly. I seem to recall reading that their finishes are eco-friendly? if this is the case I can accept that and the finish in no  way hampered the function of the device. Besides on the friction surfaces of  any eight~ this area shows finish wear quickly.   Overall~ this product performs as well~ or better than any other  rescue-8 on the market (lookout CMI.) And~ for the price the Fusion Rescue-8 is  impossible to beat. I am happy and proud to have this piece of gear on my rack and I look forward to a lifetime of service from this rescue-8.   As a testament to this I am going to order another six!   Felix C. Trujillo II   BSA Climbing Director~  Sam Houston Area Council   Assistant Scoutmaster Troop 1377
942,cmi,rescue-rack,5.0,"   My ""go-to"" rappel device.   Pros   Cons   I have bounced many pits on this rack~ and it's still going strong.   There are different kinds of racks on the market. As a 6'2""~ 190lb caver~ I wanted a rack with lots of friction options.   CMI uses a stainless steel frame with aluminum bars. The top bar is solid~ extending the life of this bar (which takes the most wear). The other bars are half channels~ reducing weight. All bars can be replaced as needed. I no longer use the rescue bar with the extension~ as I've never needed that much friction.   The top bar has a grooved channel~ to help ensure the rappeller doesn't create a ""Death Rig.""   Speaking of death...no one should be jumping onto a rack without some training from a qualified instructor. Rigged incorrectly~ a rack will open up as soon as it is weighted. This has been the cause of death for many novice cavers (and even a few experienced ones). www.caves.org can direct you to a local caving club (called a ""Grotto)~ where folks can teach you how to use a rack properly.      "
943,bluewater-ropes,rescue-8,5.0,"   A must-have item for folks on rope!   Pros   Cons   I work with two of these. The first is in my personal climbing bag~ for use in my caving activities. The second is in the ""Rescue Bag"" on the high ropes challenge course I manage in central Illinois.   The primary advantage of a Rescue 8 over a smaller Figure 8 are the protruding ""ears"" on each side. These ears prevent an unexpected girth hitch from occurring in the middle of a rescue. The large opening also allows for an extra turn of the rope~ when you need to support/lower two full grown adults.   In my program~ we hook the 8 onto the belay cable~ above the victim. The working end is attached to the victim; the running end is dropped to a ground belayer~ who uses a belay tube (ATC) for added friction.    I've trained dozens of high ropes facilitators on emergency rescue take downs~ and I wouldn't stock a rescue bag without this item in it.   "
944,faders,classic-figure-eight,2.5,   The only piece of climbing gear that will NOT open a beer bottle.   Pros   Cons      So another piece of gear I liberated from Grandma's garage is this old-school figure eight. For a rather complicated reason~ Grandma had some climbing gear lying around and needed to get rid of it so I obliged.    I don't ever see these used anymore at the crag but I understand that they were all the rage when climbers used twenty feet of webbing for a harness and practiced belaying by catching a 300# bucket full of concrete. My firefighter friend says they still use them in the rescue field though so I figured (no pun intended) I'd give it a try.    OK~ before you all chime in with the hate~ I am aware that ice climbers~ tree workers~ etc still use these and it is possible to use them with minimal rope twisting if properly used.    It's simple enough to set up and braking is also simply accomplished. I have heard that belaying with these is not recommended and the kids were not available to act in the place of buckets of concrete so I tried a quick rappel from the old practice tree in the yard.    Everyone is right. They do twist the rope. Not horribly but more than an ATC and it is heavier and less versitile than an ATC.   As an example of the figure eight species this one seems well made and durable. The picture shows that this eight gave the previous owner some good service. As a good device to use climbing I too am of the camp who says that there are better options today.   The REAL question to me is~ would I rather rapp with one of these or a Munter hitch? Hmm... Tough one. A munter wears on the rope a lot but weighs nothing. This beauty is nicer to the rope's sheath but I'll only ever need it if I lose my ATC. Add to that the fact that it cannot open a beer bottle after climbing is over and it's a slam dunk.    I'm going to see if my firefighter buddy wants to trade it for something useful. The prices these go for make me think that if I get a nice draw or a locking carabiner for it I should be happy. If not~ it will join the super old ice axes I also got from Grandma's garage in the Man-cave as an enduring tribute to good gear which is no longer necessary.
945,rock-empire,r.e.-guard-ii,1.0,"   This belay device jams only slightly while belaying a lead in the gym~ but it impossible to use while belaying a second in guide mode. The jamming is so bad that I think the product is dangerous.   Pros   Cons   At first glance this looked like a normal belay device that can be used in guide mode. Just about everyone makes one now~ and this was half the price of the rest of the belay devices I saw in Hudy Sport near Masarykovo nadrazi in Prague 1~ Czech Republic.   I got it to use in Sumava and in Cesky Krumlov during the weekend after my friend had dropped my belay device while climbing Gerlachovsky stit in the High Tatras the previous weekend. Anyway~ it rained the weekend I went to Sumava and Cesky Krumlov so no rock climbing.   I took the device back to the U.S. and was using it in the gym with my friend. I use a 10.4 for lead in the gym~ and was having trouble getting the rope in and out of the device. I'll explain. Like a Black Diamond ATC or Petzl Reverso there are two parallel chambers to feed the rope through that are shaped like ovals. On this device the slots are shaped like a 'figure 8."" In the center of each slot is a constriction. It works for single pitch sport and rappelling with only a little difficulty~ the rope jams a bit while feeding but it is manageable.   For belaying a second this device does not work. With the guide modes on most devices~ the device autolocks due to friction between the rope to the climber and the free end. With the constriction in the middle the ropes don't have much contact~ so guide mode cannot be used effectively. That is inconvenient but workable.    But~ I had the rope to the second get stuck in the chamber and then forced into half of the device with the free end (this must be hard to picture but I do not know how else to explain it). The device completely locked up and could have turned into a very bad situation had my second not been on a 2x2 meter wide ledge and able to secure himself and give me a little slack.   This is an inexpensive belay device~ by a company that makes a lot of good equipment in Czech Republic. I use Rock Empire cams sometimes as well as runners and draws. I don't like poorly reviewing a company I like~ but this device has been terrible and I would recommend staying away from it and saving $10 elsewhere."
946,petzl,vasak,5.0,   I have the Vasak Spirlock crampons~ not the ones pictured which are the Sidelock. Just got to give them a good test on Mt. Washington Feb. 21~ 2007. They were great~ easy to put on and take off. A great buy!
947,petzl,vasak,5.0,   Other crampons I have used:       Grivel G14       Grivel Rambocomp       Stubai Ultralight       Black Diamond Sabretooth       Grivel G10    The Bad:       The anti-snowballing plates on the bottom become damaged fairly easy when mixed climbing.    The Good:       Great performers on mixed terrain.       A good variety of options for the binding systems.       Light for a well built steel crampon.       Broad and forward directed front points. Good for snow climbing.       Easily adjusts to many sizes.       Price Paid:       $139.95       Review 11-23-2006 (by Ray Borbon):    I picked these Petzl - Charlet Vasak crampons up in 2004 from Pro Mountain Sports in Seattle. My friends and I were heading in to the Coast Mountains of British Columbia to climb on Talchako Mountain. Before picking these up I had been using either Grivel Rambocomps on the winter waterfall ice or Stubai Ultralights for skating across glaciers in the Cascade Range during the summer. What I really needed was something that was made out of steel for the strength~ climbed well on rocky terrain~ and was fairly light. I chose these crampons because they seemed to have a good set of wide and forward protruding front points for steep snow. The secondary frontpoints (the ones behind the frontpoints) are also tilted forward slightly in order to give the bottom of your foot more stability when standing on the frontpoints. This makes for less stressful climbing and saves energy. I was looking for a system which would mold well with my 10 year old LaSportiva Makalu boots~ a set of high top approach sneakers~ or even on a set of plastic boots as well. Considering that I chose the FlexLock binding system. This was new to me. I was always skeptical about how well the crampons mated with the boots with these sort of binding set ups. Generally I was scared that my boot would come out of the crampons while climbing steep terrain and leave me in trouble.    We headed out on our trip and made our climb which required numerous pitches of mixed climbing~ steep snow and ice and well plenty more rock climbing too. They performed on that trip quite well. I was really excited that I also lost that fear of the boots coming out of the crampons. This binding system is solid. I don't doubt it one bit. After this climb we got back to camp and eventually I got around to doing an equipment inventory. I noticed that the anti-snowballing plates on the bottom were already seeing some noticable abuse after only one climb. It wasn't really a huge surprise but I was hoping that they would be a little bit tougher than they turned out to be. This crampon needs to come stock with an anti-snowballing set up which permits simple removal of them without the use of tools. At this time it is unclear to me if there is a newer anti-snow system which comes stock on a set of Vasak crampons. Replacements seem to be in the $30 price range.    Later on I took them on a round of many other alpine climbs in the Cascades and B.C. Coast Range and these crampons are the workhorses in my stock of crampons now. The Vasaks have had no problems fitting on my Scarpa Alpha double plastic boots or my La Sportiva approach high top sneakers. That's a fairly wide range of footwear. They're so light that some people question whether or not they are steel. I would recommend these crampons as they are well worth the money spent. 
948,petzl,vasak,4.0,   I have the Vasak Spirlock as pictured. The one with heel wire bail and front toe binding. Mine come with the grey soft rubber anti-balling plates. I spent two weeks recently on Chola Shan (6168m)in Sichuan~ China. The mountain is heavily crevassed. It is mostly dry summer ice field that I walked on (in August).    The binding system (spirlock) is a bit more tricky to put on than the traditonal heel-lever one. Maybe it was the altitude and cold fingers. I was a bit worry at first that it might not bind well at the heel. But after subjecting them to two weeks of glacial travel and some ice climbing I am convinced. It does what it promised to do (general mountaineering) well.    The longest section of steep alpine ice that I did is a 50m plus of 70 degree ice wall. And I finished the climb without any issue. That speaks well for the crampons and the rather odd binding system (spirlock).    The only issue I have is that the soft rubber anti-balling plates don't seem to last. I noticed some cracks on them. I guess it's due to the heavy use on rough ice surface and the moraine.          
949,petzl,vasak,5.0,   I have not used these crampons for climbing yet. Don't know if I even will.   However~ I purchased these (I have the ones pictured) crampons for hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park. What a difference they make. Last year I used Yaktrax and I continued to slide all over the trail and loose my footing.    With the crampons that is not an issue. I have used them on fresh powder and snow and ice packed trails.  They work best on packed snow and ice.   I did find that when trekking throught knee deep new powder and the first for the season that I hit a lot of rocks when walking and caused me to just about lose my ballance.   High altitude hiking with packed snow and ice~ they are tops. I prefer them to snowshoes any time.   My only trouble is~ I seem to catch the inside of my left pant leg with my right foot and the spikes are cutting into my gaiters.     Also~ I should add~ they are much easier to walk in than what I thought they would be when looking at them in the store. Assuming of course you are on packed snow or ice.   -John
950,black-diamond,raven-pro,5.0,   This axe is strong~ light and comes pretty sharp out of the box~ though I did sharpen it more. For spring~ winter or fall I take this thing up the mountain. Great design!   Pros   Cons   I have used this axe as an anchor~ a walking tool~ a chopping tool and arrest tool. It is versatile and a great companion for my mountaineering journeys.
951,black-diamond,raven-pro,5.0,   Most ergonomic ice axe I could find. Much more comfortable than the Petzl Icewalker in my hands. Not sure if the weight difference between the PRO version and the regular Raven is that significant. The ice axe handles well for self arrests and does not seem to suffer in mixed terrains on rocks.   Overall the most comfortable ice axe I could find and gets the job done when it counts.
952,black-diamond,raven-pro,4.5,   I have only had it for one season. I have only practiced with it and it does work for a self arrest. I was a little worried about the pick being shorter. Carrying it feels natural. It is super light and that is what I was going for.
953,camp,corsa-nanotech,5.0,   This is all the ice axe you need for any mountaineering objective that doesn't require a technical ice tool. There is simply no reason to own or consider using a more traditional / heavier ice axe~ even for trips that involve mostly glacier walking. This axe is so light you'll never hesitate to bring it with you when other bigger axes might seem like a drag.    Pros   Cons   I've used this ice axe on a few dozen alpine climbing trips over the last two years in various mountain ranges in Washington and British Columbia. The best feature is of course its light weight which makes it less of a drag to carry on long approaches that are so common in the Cascades.   The slightly lighter all-aluminum version is less useful because of the aluminum pick and spike~ but the Nanotech version with its steel pick and spike is all the ice axe I've ever needed.   Shortly after getting the Corsa Nanotech~ I did a long glacier climb and decided to bring my old Raven Pro ice axe for more walking comfort. What a mistake. The slight improvement in comfort of holding onto it while walking on the glacier was not nearly enough of an advantage to compensate for how heavy it was compared to the Corsa. Since then~ I've never brought any other ice axe anywhere (except of course when I've needed a technical ice tool).    The adze is small but still works just fine for digging a T-slot to bury a picket in~ which is the only thing I ever use an adze for.    If you climb alpine objectives where you have to carry your ice axe and/or crampons over a big rock climb~ you'll especially appreciate the light weight of this axe. But even if you don't and just like non-technical glacier climbs~ there's simply no reason to carry around heavier axes when this one is available.    A few minor critiques:
954,camp,corsa-nanotech,5.0,   Awesome axe.  So light~ you'll actually bring it with you.   Pros   Cons   Years ago~ I bought a 50cm for ski mountaineering and for that purpose it is hard to beat. A year or two later~ I bought another so that I now also have a 60 cm~ and one of them now seems to go with me on nearly every trip~ from winter ski tours to late-summer alpine traverses.   Unless I know I will be facing lengthy sections of steep~ hard snow or ice~ I bring it. Because of the ultralight weight~ I almost never leave an axe at the car only to regret it later.     Picks and tips are lasting nicely~ however I did slightly bend one adze when trying to chop into hard water ice (get a real axe for that!). Highly recommended!
955,petzl,nomic,5.0,   I'll preface the five star rating by saying that I have never owned an off-the-shelf ice tool that performed this well without any modifications. I've owned or used most of the new generation leashless tools (Petzl Ergo~ BD Fusion~ Simond Scud/Coyote~ Grivel Monster/X-Monster) and none have come close to the overall high performance of the Nomic.   Most of the tools listed above specialize in either ice climbing or mixed climbing~ but the Nomic performs at the highest level for both ice and rock. It is rock solid on ice and the high clearance gets around the biggest ice features. For mixed climbing~ it is incredibly stable~ with next to no pick shift when you change between grips.   I would highly recommend this tool.
956,petzl,nomic,5.0,   Great ice tool for waterfall ice and mixed climbing! Taken me from Rjukan to the Alps and back again!   Pros   Cons   Great ice tool! I bought mine used though a friend (so I do not own the newest generation). It's been perfect for me~ climbing WI 3-5 and mixed alpine routes. I can't think of much more to wish for in an ice tool.   I was so lucky as to get different blades with the tool~ so one for training~ one for mixed~ one for alpine~ and one for water ice. Great swing~ even without weights.   The only thing I wonder about some times is that the tool sometimes feels a bit soft when dry tooling~ like the blade is a bit loose. That might be because I'm not using Petzl's original screws for fastening the blades. It's nothing I notice climbing~ only when training inside.   Overall I would recommend this tool for everyone looking for a technical tool to do it all! If I need a new tool at some point~ Petzl will be my first go to place. 
957,black-diamond,neve,5.0,   I used these climbing up Mt. Whitney. I went with aluminum over the steel to just to save weight. I was careful not to step on exposed rocks. They held up fine.   I used a non-mountaineering boot which they are made for and they fit pretty well~ never came loose. I used a Sorel Conquest Boots and they actually fit. The boot is wide in the heel so they fit snug on the sole but got they job done. The boot is flexible and the crampon flexed with the boot and never slipped off the soel. I kept them tight.   The straps are long and got in the way. You need to tuck them away or cut the excess off to the right lenght~ just enough to pull tight. These you need to stay off the rocks or they will get spurs and they are not as sharp as steel.   I will keep using them for what they are intended for~ snow travel with ice~ glacier travel. I am very happy with these.
958,black-diamond,neve,4.5,   Excellent touring crampons for ordinary hiking boots.   Pros   Cons   I've owned a couple of pairs of touring crampons for ordinary hiking boots. These are soo much better than my first pair you wouldn't even put them in the same competition.   After correctly setting the length of my boot~ these crampons have NEVER slipped off my boot — unlike my other pair!   For their intended use these are just great. These are obviously not for ice climbers! But for touring in steep old snow these are just fabulous.   Highly recommended!
959,black-diamond,raven-with-grip,5.0,"   If you have ever wondered if you need an ice axe~ the answer is yes and this is probably the one you need.    Pros   Cons   When your mountaineering requires a little pick swinging~ but not enough to justify a hybrid tool like the Black Diamond Venom (I lost mine~ then bought another later) the Raven is a very good choice.    The Raven is my fourth ice axe. I have climbed Mt. Adams~ St. Helens~ and I just returned from using my Raven on my second summit of Mt Rainier. I've also used axes on several smaller summit scrambles. My needs are mostly along the lines of balance~ self-arrest~ and lower angle snow climbing (up to 45 degrees).    Conditions Tested   I used the Raven on Mt. Rainier on the Disappointment Cleaver route~ which is the most moderate route on the mountain and includes some small bergschrund crossings where I used the axe overhand style and a decent amount of highly abrasive rock scrambling.    I used this axe on Mt. Saint Helens in a spring climb as well.   I also practiced self arrest with the Raven and found it to work as expected.    I purchased the 55cm version because if 55cm doesn't reach the snow you aren't on steep enough terrain to need an ice axe in the first place.  Shorter axes also arrest very well. They are lighter and faster to move around.    Rainier Summit   Durability   After clanging around on rock the raven shows surprisingly little damage.  The stainless steel head has shown to be durable and resists dulling as SS steel is known for.    Mount Saint Helens~ about to summit   Weight   1lb. 2oz. is not out of the middle range for axes but is slightly heavier than some offerings from BD. You end up carrying these a lot so weight is a consideration but so is swinging and biting power which is sacrificed with lighter axes.    Easily stashed in a gear loop or spare 'biner~ on Mt Rainier~ Mt Adams in the background   Ergonomics   The rubber grip~ though not strictly necessary~ is a nice feature when you swing the axe overhand which isn't very often for most climbers. Some speculate that the grip impedes plunging which it does not. Unlike other axes which have wider necks~ the narrow neck by the head feels very nice in the hand and it is a pleasure to carry all day~   Features   The included sliding wrist leash joined the rest of the ones that come on my axes in a bin~ unused. A sliding wrist leach SOUNDS like a great idea until you have to switch hands during climbing~ then it's just a damn nuisance.   I use an umbilical attached to the head. I used to say that you don't really have to worry about losing your axe because no one ever drops theirs. Then I watched one slide into a crevasse this weekend after a guided client dropped his during a fall.    Price   Ice axes are found at every price range and I think that the $80-100 range is fine for something that will last as long as you live.    Who needs this axe   The Raven is not your next ice climbing axe~ but works well for glacier travel and moderate angle snow climbs where self arrest is a possibility. It's light enough to bring along ""just in case"" and fills a lot of needs.   Update 04/2016: At the top of Mt Hood again with the Raven and the Venom Hammer.  Two tool fun!"
960,black-diamond,raven-with-grip,4.5,   Raven with some really nice upgrades. The luxury model!   Pros   Cons      First there was the BD Raven~ then the lighter Raven Pro~ and the Raven Ultra. And now the Raven with some modern upgrades. While this isn't as hard core as the Raven Pro~ this axe is a nice notch up in other areas.    It comes with a slider leash and a comfortable dual-density handle~ both helpful on a winter traverse. In my opinion~ using an axe without a leash is kind of like driving a car without a seatbelt~ since if you fall and lose the axe in the process~ you're pretty much done. And when you're carrying the axe by the shaft~ the softer handgrip stops your hand from freezing and provides a more secure grip.   I like the pick's curve and teeth~ and when I tried out a few self-arrests~ I found them to have excellent grip. Showed off a bit at an ice face by sinking the tip and hanging off it~ just like an ice-climbing axe. I like the heavier adze for chopping steps or digging a hole. The hand grip is set flush with the shaft so it doesn't interfere with plunging~ and you can get a solid grip when the footing's tricky. The head is also notched with a comfortable finger grips to make it easy to hang onto~ and it has a moderate positive angle.   The shaft is aircraft-grade aluminum~ and the head is investment-cast stainless steel~ just like the other BD axes. Base weight is about 450 gms~ and the additional weight of the leash would be nominal~ so it's right in the mid-range of modern ice axes.
961,grivel,g12,5.0,   I used these crampons climbing and descending Alum Cave Trail last week in the Smokies. The traction these things provided was incredible. Used them for about 3 miles up the trail and 5 miles down and they never slipped one single time on the ice~ snow~ or even rocks.   The only issue that I blame myself for and not the equipment is one crampon did pop off on the walk down the mountain. However~ I believe this to be my fault for not verifying fit that morning since I set the fit at home at 70 degrees F and I think the boot soles shrank the next morning when the temp was -2 degrees F.   I would not have attempted this trail had I not had these devices that provide such great traction.
962,grivel,g12,5.0,   I am a mountain hiker and I am active all year round~ mainly in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps. Day tours only. I walk on Hanwag shoes from early spring to late autumn with the support of light crampons if necessary. In winter I hike on Raichle All Degrees with Grivel G12 crampons. Excellent combination.   To the Grivel G12 crampons:   This is an excellent product. Very sturdy and versatile. For my Raichle shoes I have the mixed version~ with the fixed clip-on binding for the heel and the universal binding for the front.   The heel clip-on binding is user-friendly and~ once fastened~ will stay tight all day long.   The front fastening system~ with the cord going through two simple rings~ is very easy and effective and hardly needs any re-fastening~ not even after some intensive climbing.   Recommendable without hesitation.
963,hillsound,trail-crampon-pro,5.0,   A welcome necessity to any slippery slope!   Pros   Cons   I like these crampons so much that I am willing to post a somewhat embarrassing photo of myself scampering up a section of steep terrain~ butt in the air. I'm not sure what I would have done without them on the hike in which this photo was taken. There was a layer of powder covering a thick sheet of ice~ and as you can see~ the terrain was pretty steep in terms of hiking trails.   The crampons were lightweight and easy to put on. My feet gripped without any trouble~ allowing me to enjoy a potentially frustrating and somewhat treacherous hike. Although there was a layer of snow over the ice~ I had no difficulty with snow packing in around the crampons because of the anti-snowballing design. The only challenge I had was occasionally catching the toe spike~ but I'm sure this was operator error and will resolve as I adjust to having them on my feet.    Full disclosure~ this was my first experience with the Hillsound Trail Crampon. In my enthusiasm to get moving~ I neglected to fit them as precisely to my boots as I should have. As a result~ I noticed that on this hike they were a bit too long for my boot~ requiring me to tighten them down more than I should have. Over time~ this resulted in extra pressure on my foot. I am guessing that this would not have been an issue if I had fitted them properly. As soon as I got them home I fitted them over my boot more precisely~ but have had no opportunity to test them~ as we have had a lot of snow since then and no need for crampons. I mention this to caution anyone from making the same mistake as me.   It would be nice to have had a bag included to protect other gear when stored in a pack. My husband owns a previous model and his came with a storage bag~ so he was surprised when one was not included. This may sound petty~ but it could make a big difference if you were to tear a hole through a valuable layer while out on the trail.     Overall~ this has been a valuable purchase that has already saved the day on one outdoor excursion for me.    
964,hillsound,trail-crampon-pro,5.0,   I tested the Hillsound Trail Crampon Pro on a small icy mountain in the Adirondack Mountains.  They packed well and are very compact not taking up too much space.   The rachet system on the binding makes it easy and fast to take on and off — very important in cold conditions. With a few 'clicks' the binding was nice and snug against my boot and stayed that way for the whole time. It was nice not to have long straps to wrap around your ankle~ etc.   The teeth on the crampon are shorter than I am used to~ a feature that I like as you don't feel like you are walking on high heels and I feel less likely to turn an ankle. The grip on the ice was fantastic.   I also have a pair of Microspikes that I usually take along on a hike~ but now feel that I will carry only the crampons as they feel almost like the Microspikes but with much more grip. This would lighten up my pack and eliminate time switching back and forth.   These are not to be mistaken for technical climbing crampons~ but these will be perfect for icy trails and those sketchy spots where you need to pull yourself up over an icy ledge.   The price is more than fair and worth every penny.
965,hillsound,trail-crampon-pro,3.0,   I have had these for three months and have used them during my quest to complete the winter 46 in the Adirondacks. First the pluses: quick on and off~ length of teeth~ carbon steel~ anti balling plates.       The negatives: the attachment system although quick is ill designed; the 4 alpine stoppers are a solution to a design problem that is inelegant and frustrating when having to use in freezing temperatures.       I have lost a crampon on the trail without these stoppers and find that the ratcheting system is doomed to fail on every outing. In addition~ in order to attach these crampons securely requires an over tightening that places pressure on the toes resulting in blisters.   Pros   Cons
966,camp,stalker,5.0,   Great for ice walks on frozen canyon floors or for glacier travel. Obviously not for ice climbing because they can't be attached rigidly to your boots.   Flexibility makes them comfortable on almost any winter boot~ and you can almost walk normally in them.   One nice extra is that the ones I bought came with antibot plates and a crampon bag. Nothing more to buy.   Remember to dry them off after use~ and when putting them away for summer storage~ dab them with oil to prevent rust.
967,camp,stalker,4.5,   Considering these are one of the cheapest crampons on the market~ I am very happy with my set. I have crossed glaciers~ climbed ice walls and mixed rock/ice~ so all in all~ very versatile.   As a downside~ the metal frame digs into my boots and have cut little holes in the rubber toe caps of my La Sportiva from the friction. I would recommend bending the metal frame out a touch to avoid this.
968,camp,stalker,4.5,   I bought these during a promotional sale at EMS. EMS by the way has the cheapest price on these even though it isn't listed here. They go for $99 I think on EMS.com   The only reason these get 4.5 stars instead of 5 is that if you pack them incorrectly~ they are literally almost impossible to adjust for size when putting them back on your boots.   It has the typical peg adjusting system. In order to fit them into the pack they come in~ they must be adjusted to a smaller size. When doing this~ make sure the metal piece that slides and the peg goes into~ goes UNDER the antibot plate~ not over it. If it goes over it~ it puts the metal at a weird angle~ and makes it VERY hard to take the peg out to adjust size.   When using these I found that they stay very stable and tight on the boots~ no slipping. They bite into the ice very well~ and had great stability even when trekking on rocks and ice mix.
969,petzl,sumtec,5.0,"   Awesome multi purpose ice axe/tool hybrid. Climbs ice better than expected~ and performs great as a ice tool. A perfect choice for the scrambler who wants a more climbing oriented axe~ an alpinist looking for a tool to get across glaciers~ snow~ neve~ and alpine ice~ or the jack of all trades axe that can do it all.   Pros   Cons   The Sum'tec is a terrific all round mountain tool. It's definitely an odd combination between a mountaineering axe and an ice tool. The tool definitely seems to be a perfect blend coming together as the perfect multipurpose alpine tool.   As a an ice tool they are almost as curved as the Quark. The picks are fairly wide~ 4.5mm~ and they have rather blunt teeth~ all in stainless steel. To me this seems a mistake. Any improvement in durability is offset by the challenge to sharpen them. Being replaceable picks I didn't see the need for added durability of stainless steel. They are also B rated which seems a disappointment~ thought I can't imagine anyone doing any significant today tooling on these.   My concern when buying them was that perhaps this was designed more as a neve tool for Chamonix~ and not for ice. However having climbed with them on ice they work way better then I thought they would. On WI4 they swung well~ the adze and hammer placing a good deal of weight behind the pick~ and stuck much better than I anticipated. The teeth held well~ and overall was remarkably similar to the quarks.   One downside was the absence of a rubber handgrip. I imagine this was ommitted to prioritize the tool as a mountaineering axe~ and to make pommel adjustment easier. I can't help but wish that they opted for a slightly recessed grip. As it stands~ the shaft is very cold in winter and a little harder to hold onto without grip tape. Any grip tape makes adjustments a challenge on the sections where the grip tape overlaps itself.    As a mountaineering axe the Sum Tec is excellent. Both the adze and the hammer feel comfortable to hold ""a piolet"" thanks to an ergonomic fit~ and no teeth closest to the shaft. With the pommel up it plunges effortlessly. I've used the Quark as an alpine tool and was surprised how arduous it can be plunging as there is a little micro pommel even with the large pommel removed. The Sum'tec has a single aggressive spike which also provides solid purchase. The adze is larger than I would have expected and very effective. Also not trimmed so it is a passable shovelling implement. The hammer functions well.    For me at 5'10"" the 52cm is a bit short for walking with~ even on 40 degree terrain. If your primary use is mountaineering I would definitely recommend the Summit Evo~ or the 59cm Sum Tec more. That being said it still arrests well~ offering a quick bite~ and fits against the body well despite being a little more curved than what I am used to. That curve also makes it dagger better than any mountaineering axe I've ever used. For scrambling and mixed moves the pommel allows you to easily switch between a good piolet and a good hooking tool.   As an alpine tool the Sum'tec combines both its great performance as a piolet and an ice tool to take on any kind of terrain. Pommel adjustments allow you to switch between an effective ice tool for alpine ice~ and then plunge deep and secure.  "
970,petzl,summit-2,5.0,   Best in class ice axe for all around mountaineering use. Pick up a Quark Trigger Rest to make the perfect all round axe.   Pros   Cons   The Summit 2 took the comfortable stainless steel head from its predecessor but removed all the superfluous rubber~ shedding half its weight. At a impressive 400g for the 66cm it works tremendously well.   Self arrests feel natural compared to the BD Raven as you don't have to alter your grip on the head~ and I find when holding a fall feels more stable than with the Raven.   For climbing it has a solid swing thanks to the weight being all in the head. The pick bites ice well~ and doesn't pop out as easily as similar ice aces (I'm looking at you~ Ravens). The grip is not quite as good as models with rubber handles~ but curiously enough the trigger rest from the Quark~ which you can buy on its own~ is a perfect fit on the shaft.   I find with the grip on the base it climbs way better than rubber handles~ and I can move it out of the way when I want to probe for crevasses. My old DMM Cirque's rubber handle used to probe poorly~ and get snow stuck on the rubber handle in comparison.    I have used it with the Linkin Leash~ which I really like for its simplicity~ and its knack for staying out of the way when you don't want it. It's comfy to climb ice with too~ though impractical compared to the trig rest for rocky terrain.   This is an awesome ice axe and I recommend it highly. 
971,black-diamond,venom-hammer-ice-axe,5.0,"   When you need a second tool~ but not necessarily a technical ice tool.   Pros   Cons   ""You know when it's good picket snow when you drive one in and you really wish you had a hammer.""   These were the words of wisdom from my crevasse rescue instructor. He was basically saying that snow should be really hard if you intend to place a picket in vertically~ otherwise you should bury it dead-man style.    ""So I need to bring two tools?"" I asked.   ""No~"" was his response.   ""Well if all I have is a hammer~ then how do I dig in the snow?"" What do you say to that smart guy?   ""With a shovel~ which is way better than an ice axe~ or dig with the picket itself~"" The guide countered. Oh~ um OK~ so I guess I don't know everything yet.    It makes sense. Except in the pages of FOTH~ the days of chopping steps are mostly gone since the invention of crampons but a hammer is pretty darn handy. Just ask Thor.    I chose the Venom hammer in 57 cm so I could make it my solo tool on ice/snow climbs like the Cascade volcanoes.    Mt Hood Summit         On the summit of Rainier. I was glad to have it when I needed to drive a picket.    I first took the Venom hammer along on snow climbs of 45 degrees maximum where my primary mode of self arrest was plunging the shaft in. For this job the slight curve in the shaft is no impediment and the tool sinks in perfectly. I had a lot of opportunity to do this on a short section of Grindstone mountain this Spring.    Venom in my left hand~ straight ice axe holstered~ where it belongs.   For self-arrest I also like the hammer because it doesn't put a sharp adze anywhere near my chest or face where I can get gouged. It is the tool of choice when my kids are practicing self-arrest.   On Mount Hood I climbed the final chute using the Venom like an ice tool~ learning how the curve of the shaft made the strike angle more aggressive resulting in better traction. A conventional ice axe pick is not quite steep enough to get a good bite into ice.    I removed the nice wrist leach it came with and put it on another axe I own and replaced it with an umbilical style webbing leach.    Anyone who has used the top of their conventional ice axe to drive a picket may tell you that this is a time you wish you had a hammer. Also driving a picket can also harm the head of lightweight ice axes.   I do not ice climb so I would not get much use from a conventional curved ice tool~ but with the Venom hammer I can make it my only tool and also gain the benefit of the curved shaft and the hammer.     I hope to own this tool long enough to wear out the pick~ and when I do it's nice to know it's easy to swap out.  After three months of weekend use I see no wear issues.    So~ if you are carrying a picket or shovel anyway~ why not ditch the conventional ice axe and consider a hammer? At one ounce heavier than the adze version it adds a lot of benefits to the climber who wants to carry just one tool.    Mount Hood summit   Mt. Hood again in 2016"
972,black-diamond,cyborg,5.0,   Last winter I lost a crampons while leading ice and had to buy a new pair for this season. I was looking at what is easily available to us here in Canada and the selection is rather simple if not limited.   Wanting something that could go from mono-point to dual-point and could fit on my size 13 boots whithout having to buy a longer flex bar reduce the choice I had. It came down to three classic pieces of gear. The G-14 from Grivel~ The M-10 from Petzl and the Cyber tooth. Now it's obvious I choice the latter but here's why.   Price: Although not the cheapest~ (props to Grivel) the price for a set with anti-bott was just right. I mean at this point I don't think 15$ makes a huge difference.   Make: Stainless steel is not lighter but it takes less to make the same strength. So they say. In any case I couldn't feel any relevant difference from the three of em once in my feet.   One con is the fact that you have less latitude for mono point configuration. Meaning~ you cant place the front point in the middle. You have to put em asymetrical~ always. I guess it could be placed in the middle with a home made mod. Your call.   As for the rest of the make~ it's flawless. The antibott works well and have been revamped (I think) to make em more flexible in the cold. If so good call~ as I heard of old ones breaking. The M-10 dont come with anti bott and the ones from Petzl cost 45$. Expensive. The front points are regular chromoly steel to be easier to sharpen and their cheap. Also good~ my frontpoints see a lot of abuse.   Performance: I had the chance to try all three. All were well worn and pretty banged up rentals. The night before I sharpened all the points to make em as good as possible. Why try old ones? Simple. In my opinion everything works fine when it's new~ the real challenge come in performance after prolonged use/abuse in this case. (Think of it as your marriage~ hopefully without use/abuse;-)   To be frank~ I couldn't tell much of a difference. They sticked in ice when they should'ved and blowed whenever I didn't watch out. The only problem came from the grivel G-14 the heel couldn't stay in place because of the lever's fit with my boot. And this on both of em.   On the upside~ the stainless seel ones looked a lot better since they had no rust and old paint that's fading away. And Again no antibott on the Petzls made snow gathering somewhat dangerous.     Fit: All three crampons fit real good with my Kayland Revolution boot. But the Cyborg didn't need a new flex bar so case closed.     So in the end I went with the ones I had before. Good fit~ simple~ no toxic paint~ no more rust. In doubt take the one that marry to your boot the best.   Good climbing.
973,petzl,leopard-fl,5.0,"   The Petzl Leopard FL is an aluminum crampon featuring a Dyneema cord adjustment system.  The crampon is so light you won't hate yourself for carrying them when you didn't need them.  They are so easy to use and so effective you'll be glad you have them when you do need them.    Pros   Cons   Specifications:   All aluminum construction optimized for snow travel   Ten points (with dual front points) assure traction on icy terrain   Very lightweight 360 gm/12 ounces for pair   CORD-TECH optimizes volume when packed in their included bag    Tool free adjustment assures secure fit    Binding system suitable for use with hiking and approach shoes~ without heel or toe welts   Boot sizes 36-46 EU/6-12 US   MSRP $169.95       Adjustment:   The holes on the front piece allow for length adjustment of front points.   The holes on the back piece are not used in the FL model of the Leopard.   Use the notches on the rear part to adjust cord to correct length and tension.   The double back strap buckle must be positioned on the outside of the foot.   It is essential to test crampons on footwear on which they will be used to ensure compatibility!     I've worn these crampons primarily with my La Sportiva Trango Cube boots and that has proven to be an excellent combination. I've also used them with Salewa Snow Trainer (a winter version of the Salewa Mountain Trainer) and they work very well with this boot also. I tried them with a Salewa Firetail approach shoe and I did not like having the strap wrapped around my ankle. I do not recommend these with low top shoes.     I found adjustment to be quite simple. I put the toe of my boot in the front bail with the crampon extended to its maximum length. I then push the back piece forward to the proper length and then set the cord in the appropriate notches on the bottom of the crampon. It's important to note that the cord must be set in the same notch on each side. You may have to repeat the process a time or two to get the proper tension on the cord.     There are two ways to attach the crampon to your boot. I begin with the buckle end on the inside of my boot and it will end up on the outside. First lead the long end of the strap through the toe piece. Second~ bring it back to the heel piece. Third~ bring it forward to the buckle and tighten it down. The buckle end of the strap will now be on the outside of your boot. This is the quick and easy method and is pretty much the standard that all flex lock crampons use.     The second method is to route the strap under the cord on each side of the crampon to add an extra bit of tension to the adjusting cord. It takes a few more seconds to do but~ in my opinion~ it adds a little extra security. I lay mine out with the adjustment straps all pre routed and it takes 30 seconds or less to don each crampon.     Here's a series of four pictures to show the two different mounting systems from a side and bottom perspective. As I said~ my preferred choice is the second method.           Here's a picture of the back piece mounted to a Trango Cube boot.  The holes serve no purpose for the flexible lock application. They are used to adjust the lever lock model.        Here's a picture of the toe mounting.  The front points can be extended by moving the bail to to the rear hole.       Experience:     Petzl~ long a leader in mountaineering equipment~ has come up with a better mousetrap!    The instruction ""manual"" provided by Petzl is the European standard set of instructions in 18 different languages with a universal set of pictures common to all the languages. I briefly perused them and set about adjusting them. The flexible nature of the cord is a bit off putting at first blush but it quickly becomes second nature. I found the adjustment to be very easy and self explanatory. A little bit of experimentation and you'll have it down pat.     Donning them on snow the first time was a little bit awkward~ again because of the flexible nature. Now I ""pre thread"" the fastening straps and then step in and snug 'em up. Usually takes no longer than thirty seconds or so. You're a better man than me if you can thread the strap through the buckle with gloves on.     I tested them at a local ski area before going live. My first real use was a springtime traverse of the Upper Enchantment lakes to include a climb up Aasgard Pass which is fairly steep. There are several fairly steep traverses to be negotiated and I had no problems.     I have a lot of confidence in these crampons. I primarily use them for their designed purpose—crossing snow fields and snow travel. I have~ however~ climbed several glaciers and a couple of glaciated peaks using these and felt quite comfortable.     How about wear and tear? Although the bodies are aluminum they show absolutely no wear after about a 100 miles of snow/ice travel. Since aluminum points are not as strong as steel they can break or wear more quickly on rock or dirt I've never worn these except on snow but my guess is a little bit of rock travel would wear them out quickly. When I encounter those conditions I take them off.     A main concern of mine was wear and tear of the dyneema adjusting cord. As I said~ I've used them for about a hundred miles or so on snow/ice and the cord shows absolutely no wear—it isn't even fuzzy in the major wear points. Petzl does sell replacement cords just in case.     For you gram weenies~ these weigh in at 386 grams/13.7 ounces a little heavier than the advertised 360 grams/12 ounces. As a point of interest~ they weigh exactly the same as Kahtoola Microspikes.              Aasgard Pass on the left~ Dragontail Peak in the middle~ and Colchuck Glacier on the right. I climbed all three in these Petzl Leopard FL crampons.     I highly recommend these crampons for their intended use and possibly beyond. Activities involving the use of this equipment is inherently dangerous. You are responsible for your own actions~ decisions~ and safety.                                                              CLIMB ON!"
974,black-diamond,contact-strap,4.0,   Easy to fit on and great traction.   Pros   These were very easy to fit to my boots (10.5D)~ and fast to get set up. I really appreciate crampons that are a breeze to put on and take off. It's not often I have an easy place to put them on when I get to ice~ snow~ etc. And the first time using them~ I could feel a lot of secure traction on snow and scree fields.
975,black-diamond,contact-strap,4.0,   So versatile and durable I have used them over and over again with zero issues.   Pros   Cons   After using them on some spring ice and snowfield crossings I bought a second pair for my son to wear with me as we climb Mt. Adams next week. After using the old (1970s) set I have I had no idea how easy and effective they could be.   They go on in a minute~ come with ease and have soft rubber anti-balling plates. I may never do any vertical front pointing~ but I trust these to keep me right-side up on any ice field crossing/climb.   Update 8/20/15: I have owned these several years now and I've climbed Mt. Adams twice~ Rainier twice~ Hood~ St Helens and several smaller peaks with these crampons and I still love them. Great on mixed terrain as well~ though not for ice climbing obviously.    Update February 2020: I still have these and use them every year!! Six Rainier summits~ two Mt Baker~ two Mount Hood~ one Mount Saint Helens~ three Mt Adams (one summit).
976,black-diamond,contact-strap,4.0,   These are great crampons for what they are designed to do~ which is carry in your pack on a winter hike~ and put them on your non-crampon compatible boots when needed. I use these when I go on early or late winter hikes where I am likely to encounter some ice and snow~ but nothing that would warrant a full mountaineering boot. I strap these to my pack~ and when I hit ice I stop and put them on.   These strap-on crampons are designed to work with boots that are not step-on crampon compatible. This is good~ since for this type of hike I just want to use my regular backpacking boots and not a mountaineering monster boot. The crampons take about 2-3 minutes to put on and about 1-2 minutes to take off and stow~ so that are not instant. They are~ however~ quite stable and secure~ so that I feel confident when ascending or descending down (non-vertical) slopes.    The only gripe I have with these crampons is that the strap system has buckles that are too small to use with gloves on--meaning you have to pull off your gloves to put them on or take them off. This isn't really a problem~ though~ because if it is too cold to do that~ you are likely going to be using mountaineering boots anyway.   Overall~ a great crampon to use with your three-season backpacking boots.
977,petzl,lynx,4.5,   Great crampon for ice and mixed climbing.   Pros   Cons   The Lynx is a pretty classic technical crampon. It fits most boots very well~ and cinches in well. I have not had any problems yet with getting it to fit my Scarpa Mont Blancs. I have also lent it out to people to use on Sportiva Trango Extremes~ Trango Evos~ and even ski boots. They fit all well.   I have climbed on these up on WI 4 and on M6. They proved able on both. Switching to mono points was a little annoying and my hands got cold~ but that is expected. Once properly set up they performed admirably. I would definitely say having used Darts before that they are a fraction more precise and give you just a tiny bit more control.   Having the option to switch between dual and mono point is invaluable if you climb ice and are interested in pursuing mixed as well.   My only gripe is with the non-clip toe bails. I don't see the point. A B2 boot just isn't suited for waterfall ice and mixed climbing as well as a B3. Horizontal crampons function much better for semi-automatic mode. If these crampons had come with horizontal front points you could switch in they would be the best true allrounders.   Overall I love them on ice and mixed and would highly recommend them.
978,black-diamond,serac-strap,4.5,   12-point stainless steel crampon that does the job.   Pros   Cons   I bought these a couple of years ago and I've used them only in snow ranging from powder to crust with my flexible hunting boots~ but never on solid ice.After some mixed rocky trail hike~ a fellow hiker advised me to buy a knife sharpening stone to sharpen the edges from time to time. I came to no result since stainless steel is VERY HARD to sharpen. Not that I needed any sharpening because till this day they are as sharp as they were when I first unboxed them.   The fit is excellent and once the adjustment is done there is no need to re-tighten since they stay in place for the rest of the hike.The anti balling plates work like a charm and never had any issues whatsoever.   My boots are size 44 and I've set the pin to 3. The standard bar cover (I think) up to size 46 boot.I didn't want to shorten the strap~ so I had some velcro sewn to it to keep it in place.Bought them new for 135 euros. OK price I guess..The weight per crampon with the velcro mod.
979,black-diamond,snaggletooth,4.5,   Good precision and grip~ but slightly heavy.   Pros   Cons   I bought them for mixed climbing routes with a lot of rock climbing involved and they proved very adequate for the task indeed. I used them with a pair of La Sportiva Baturas and they performed very well with great feeling and precision.   However there was this incident on the downclimb when one of the crampons suddenly came off without particular reason. I had them fitted really hard~ so I don't know what happened but since then I am a bit cautious.   By the way~ the above text was first published on the Black Diamond's homepage~ but even though the crampons were given 5/5 stars~ the text was moderated and removed. So the reviews there are filtered.
980,camp,x-dream,4.5,"   Ice climbing dream.   Pros   Cons   For pure WI these are my favorite ice tool to date. The slim pick usually is a one swing wonder~ which makes steep climbs less tiring. With my Nomics I feel like I have to battle-axing in to the ice~ but not the X-dream even with the ""mixed"" pick. The handle has two positions ice and Mixed~ I keep mine on the ice setting.  The difference is that the mixed sets the handle angle a bit more aggressive.    My only gripe is the little adjustable plastic grip rest on the upper shaft~ I broke one off the first day out. However just take them off there are not needed anyway for ice.   For mixed climbing they do very well~ BUT the picks take a beating. After a few laps in one day the picks were beatup~ bent and mushroomed. When compared to the BD green Fusions with Titan picks and the Nomics the X-dreams are thin and soft. The Fusion and Nomics  are much better mixed durability~ but the tradeoff is the fatter picks are not as good on pure ice.   For ice climbing I give the X-Dreams a solid 5.   For mixed I give them a 4 star~ they do very good but just be prepared to burn through picks."
981,grivel,g10,4.0,   High quality~ good fitting steel crampon. Excess strap is annoying.   Pros   Cons   I use these for hiking and scrambling when there is enough slope that I need the grip. They hold well on ice and hard pack~ and give some assurance in deep snow. The antibott works as advertised...I never get snow packing on them.   They are a 10-point crampon and designed for regular hiking boots~ NOT mountaineering boots. The toe and heel fittings fold down and the length collapses to make them easier to pack. The straps stay tight and the crampons stay put on the boot.   My only complaint is that the strap is long and there is no place to secure it~ aside from trying to tuck it in around the boot. Doesn't affect performance though.   
982,grivel,g10,4.0,   Great for the price. Used them on small ice travel and inclines; they did quite well. They're well built and do well on the the ice. They get the job done.   The only thing I noticed is~ they need to be kept quite sharp to get the most out of them~ but that can pretty much be said for any pair of crampons.   Overall~ I liked them very much. Would recommend for light ice travel and general mountaineering.
983,black-diamond,viper,4.0,   Great ice tool for pure ice climbing. Even with the add on features (fang~ ...)~ it's not as good as the new specialized tools for dry tooling. And~ with their curved shafts~ they  lose some of their usefulness in alpine settings. You can get by with your Vipers just about anywhere; but they're really in their element on pure waterfall ice.    They have a nice weight/heft to them. Not too light~ not too heavy. The shape gives really good clearance over bulges. The handle is nicely shaped (hourglass shape gives you great control of the direction of your placement). BD picks are as good as any of the other top picks on the market. I find I get great sticks with my Vipers but sometimes find them a bit hard to pull out. Probably more an issue with my technique than a problem with the tool.    Vipers work well both with a full arm swing or with a wrist-flick. The Viper Android leashes are awesome once you get used to them. They have one bad flaw though: the length is such that once you get them adjusted perfectly for climbing in them~ they are not long enough to allow you to put your hand on top of the head of the tool. Awkward... But~ all in all~ for waterfall ice~ you can't go wrong with these tools. Plus~ they've held up really well now after three winters of moderate use.
984,black-diamond,cyborg-pro,4.0,   BD Cyborg Pro - Light enough~ versatile~ easy to use~ strong and functional. I've never had a problem with these and I use them every year on 14'ers...on soft mash potato snow to alpine ice and thin ice~ they do the job. The new stainless steel version works well with shedding sticky snow and dirt. They are easy to clean off during and after a trip.   Pros   Cons   I used the newer Black Diamond Cyborg Pro in stainless steel on spring and winter routes on Mt. Shasta and really enjoy using them. I bought the step-in version as I prefer step-ins over strap-on or hybrid crampons. I like the solid feel and security of having front and rear levers~ instead of plastic straps.   From older '90's single leather climbing boots to the latest multi-material technical climbing boots that have front rear welts~ the Cyborgs do the job and do it well. Although they are designed for mainly technical ice climbing and higher grades over general mountaineering slopes..I've found them to be useful on just about every type of route and in any season.   Single point or double point..your choice as they are interchangeable - [-:
985,black-diamond,raven,4.5,   How much can you say about an ice axe? This is not the lightest axe or strongest axe~ but it's the best general mountaineering axe on the market. It does its job.   Pros   Cons   Call me old school~ but I believe an ice axe is the last place to try to save weight. You want something strong and burly. If you want to cut ounces~ go for a jog and lose the love handles.The Raven is perfect for self belay and self arrest. Make you get it long enough — if you need something shorter~ get a more technical axe like the BD Venom.   And after all my harping about weight~ the difference between this and the Pro model actually isn't all that much. It is still very lightweight. It's not a pain to carry on a long climb. I find it to be the perfect weight for chopping steps~ for example~ but I wouldn't want it any lighter.   What really sets the Raven and the Raven Pro apart from the others? In the end~ it's the comfort in your hand. It's way more comfortable than most Grivel or Petzl axes. It is easy to get a good grip on this thing when your life depends on it.   I'm not sure what others are complaining about with this axe. It doesn't have a rubbery grip. You don't want one of those~ but you can go buy that model of the Raven if you decide you just have to have a grippy ice axe.    If you want to climb ice~ get something stronger~ heavier~ more expensive~ and less suitable for general mountaineering. If you refuse to take ice axes because they weight too much~ you can find ski mountaineering axes that are considerably lighter than this one. But for the standard mountaineer~ this is the one you want.
986,black-diamond,raven,2.0,"   The only positive with this product is the price~ which although low for an ice ax not even worth it.   The pick is narrow and rather annoying~ it reminds me of a pencil. The adze is cut out in the center and is horrible for cutting steps (if you ever have to). The shaft offers no grip whatsoever.   The only reason you should ever buy this ax is if you are ONLY going to be using it on very very easy slopes and want a cheap ax ""just in case"". Otherwise cough up some dough and go with a Grivel or Petzl."
987,grivel,x-monster,3.0,   I've used these axes in mixed conditions and on ice and found they perform very differently.   Pros   Cons   On ice they are the perfect level of aggressive and terrific for beginners as the price makes the sport a bit more accessible~ and they are simple to use. Though a bit heavy~ they have a good swing~ and are very comfortable to hold. Grip tape on the upper handle is essential~ but easily added.   The picks are very durable~ and can take a great deal of abuse.   On mixed and rock these perform rather poorly. The sheet metal shaft has a habit of bending severely when attempting to torque~ and stein pulls feel risky. I almost bent mine while attempting a torque move. While this is really only a problem when dry tooling it should be considered. I also felt that while they had a great swing straight into ice and snow~ they were rather clumsy for placement on rock~ or anything that didn't involve plunging them down. As    The heavy head~ with the thin shaft felt a bit off balance compared to a quark~ or a viper.   All that being said if you aren't intending to use them very much for mixed~ and intend to mostly ice climb on straight forward routes they are perfect and brilliant value.
988,kahtoola,kts-hiking-crampons,1.5,   Would be excellent~ but for a design flaw. Rear cleats are too close together causing an instability when hiking over hard surfaces~ such as ice or rock.   Pros   Cons   The Kahtoola hiking crampons shown in the photo are of a flawed design. I bought a pair last year and tried them out in a variety of conditions—ranging from packed snow to icy trails.   The length of the spikes make them very good on packed snow~ but on ice or icy trails they are very wobbly. This instability on hard ice is caused by the too-narrow back spike plate. As the heel of the boot lands on ice (or any hard surface) that narrowness translates into twisting the boot left or right.   Other similar hiking crampons—such as those from Natuworld and the KTS shown above—have a wide enough rear spike plate to provide ample lateral stability.
989,dmm,cirque,5.0,"   My first axe.   Pros   Cons   When I started looking for an ice axe I came across a lot of options for general mountaineering use~ but not a single one included a sturdy technical grade one. I wouldn't know if a basic grade axe could withstand anything else than basically walking on soft snow so I really wanted a technical one but not something ""exotic"". So a hybrid axe it is!   For now it's just walking and cutting steps since I never encountered a glacier in Crete to give it a go on ice~ but I feel confident when the time comes due to its full T-rating.   I've been using it for two winter. Sounds like a GoT thing right? (lol)   Not the lightest one...I know.""Handmade"" protection.BTW~ do you guys think that BD's spike and pick protection will cover DMM's as well? Feels comfortable enough to the hand~ though it doesn't have the BD's ergonomics.   The silicon grip is great when cutting steps and somewhat insulating from cold as well. Just wish it had arm rest as option.Forgot to mention that the leash is included as standard."
990,dmm,cirque,4.0,   Excellent mountaineering axe for more technical use.    Pros   This is a excellent lightweight mountaineering axe. It is very useful in all situations. It has a slight curve~ making it excellent for swinging. It's worth practicing arrests with it if you aren't used to curved tools. It's comfortable in the hand and just all a round great mountaineering axe.    It works great on glaciers~ and performs well on steep sow gullies. I couldn't be happier. I do wish it had an adjustable plastic handle. 
991,simond,chacal,5.0,   I have tried a variety of tools through the years.   My 4 favorites~ you will see a review on each.   The Simond Chacal with interchangeable tips (not uncommon these days) was one of the leaders of time gone by. Quality and durability equals my other three favorites too. Nice feel~ relatively easy (with the right tools) to change the tips.  Easier to do at the top or start of a climb but possibly mid climb too.    Strongly recommend taking a Craftsman Combination Wrench and grind the open end off then drill a hole. Add a ring for a carrabiner to the hole. Also~ pick up a punch for the two pins and drill a hole in it (near the hammer end~ thicker there).  Those two tools along with your other climbing tool (hopefully a hammer face~ a Forest Moljner would be perfect!) will allow you to change where/when needed.    If you have pounded your gear in to rocks and need to swap tips~ find a spot to clip in and lean back. You'll be back to a sharp tool quickly.  Swap tips and away you go. Has pretty much the same tip choices (droop~ 45 angle~ and tube (well~ 1/2 tube anyway)) as the Moljner and many of the present day changables.   Small spike end even came in handy numerous times~ driving it vertically in to hard snow with the Moljner (no spike on the Moljner so that choice was easy).  Not a recommended practice but~ when little else is available - better than nothing at all!  (It Held!)   You can call this a 30+ year test cycle - passed with flying colours.   Thank You~ Simond & Co!  Your quality - Greatly Appreciated
992,stubai,tour-lite-telescoping,5.0,"   This is a great tool for exploring a wide range of terrain. The telescoping feature is reliable and well designed.   Pros   Cons   After much research  I finally bought the Stubai telescoping axe as a versatile hiking tool.   The first thing I noticed about this tool was how well it was built .   It has an aluminum head. Delivered with snow basket. Perfect for trekking and glacier walking. Its telescopic shaft can be adjusted according to individual requirements from 60 to 95 cm. It works well for me as I am 6'1"" and need the length for more level terrain.   It only takes a few seconds to adjust the  pole. It is marked every 10 cm. Once you have it adjusted a firm twist will make sure the pole stays in place. A good grip is needed to twist it firmly into position~ but after it is secure  the mechanism holds it in place and the pole is not going to move. I have a strong grip~ and if this part were substandard or going to break it surely would have shown a sign of weakness. But the Stubai holds strong. It has proven to be a reliable design to me. I take it with me most of the time.   The only thing I noticed is that when making adjustments long sometimes you may pull the pole out too far and it can pop out. This is really not a problem as the pole easily goes back into the axe. However if you were ever in a cumbersome situation and dropped the pole end down a slope you may need to retrieve it.   The snow basket at the end can be removed by unscrewing the tip. The tip is very secure with a snug thread.   I take the Stubai Ice Axe TOUR LITE Telescope with me climbing less technical routes like Mt. Bailey~ South Sister~ or even Mt. Shasta. But I would go for a more specialized tool for anything more technical."
993,stubai,tirol-pro,5.0,   Superbly constructed.   It is Austrian made and reasonably priced compared to Petzl~ but lower prices do not mean there is any compromises in the safety of the product. It is just not known as good as Petzl and the others do.   Tirol is a remarkable 12 point tempered spring steel mountaineering crampon with flexible bar~ available with three different bindings: pro step-in binding~ combi binding for welt less toe boots or universal binding that will fit almost any footwear for steep ice and mixed terrain. Crooked side points for safe traversing and horizontal front points provide superb stability and reduce the danger of slipping – especially useful on corned snow (firn). With integrated STUBAI STICK-ON anti-balling system.   The pairs weight is 2.3 pounds. Bomb Proof Steel Construction. High Quality & Made To Last.   I am using them for almost two years without any problem what so ever. I would dearly recommend them to anyone who needs a good dependable pair of mountaineering crampons.
994,cassin,x-alp,4.5,   I've bought my new Cassin X-Alp 6 mounts ago and they are great. I've tried them on WI 4-5 even on WI 6 and they were fabulous. I would put them on the same line with Petzl Quarks~ just find the handle with finger guard and they would be just perfect for any type of climbing.   Previously i had DMM Fly~ Simond Naja~ also used Quark and Nomic... but i can't compare it with X-Alp. For the money they give the most universal of these ice axes and i just love them a because of that. Although their usage is more for alpine-mix routes but they won't let you down on pure ice routes.   Ones again Cassin proved to produce very well balanced ice axes. It's a pity that they are hard to be found as Cassin was merged with Camp so i don't know their business strategy~ if they will continue producing them or not.    I was lucky~ i bought them in a Slovenian shop in Belgrade~ Serbia.... So good luck~ if you buy them i are not going to be sorry at all.. what is most interesting is that i paid 75 EUR per/axe which is rather cheap.    
995,omega-pacific,mountain-axe,4.0,   I like this axe.  I have used it on self-arrest practice and to climb steep~ hard spring snowfields~ no serious mountaineering though.   It bites into the ice when I slip and cuts nice foot holds for the kids when I want it to.  The point~ I noticed~ has a positive angle.  The books say this isn't ideal and I may adjust it some with a grinder but the issue hasn't come up for me.  As far as an axe is concerned~ it does the job.   I wrapped the head with athletic tape near the handle to save on my gloves after I saw an old mountaineer do the same to his.  I know that this axe is considered inferior to more expensive ones but I can't see why.  For a beginning mountaineer like me it does just fine.
996,omega-pacific,mountain-axe,4.0,   Very sturdy ice axe. I bought the 80CM one to use as a cane in moderate to steep climbing. I sharpened the spike and pick with a file~ that's the only modification I made. I may put some friction tape on the handle~ I have done that on my other axes~ and it helps.   I have a Black Diamond ice axe and this one compares favorably. I am very happy with my purchase.
997,black-diamond,fusion,3.5,   This is going to be a bit of a comparison between the Petzl Nomic and the Fusion. I have been using both now for the last three years~ these are my conclusions.   For pure steep ice I prefer the Nomic. It swings less like a battle ax (Fusion being the battle ax) and the pick sticks more securely but yet is easy to remove. BD has some catching up on with their pick tech. The Fusion alway seem to take more effort to get a solid stick~ and when it's in it takes a bit to get the pick dislodged.   For mixed climbing I prefer the Green Fusions. They are very stable at hooking and the grip (for me) is easer to hold and more comfortable for susstained holding in very overhanging terrain. I like the ruberized grip up the shaft of the tool as well with the Fusions. I find after a season the grip tape on the Nomics tend to loosen and roll down and need replacing.   Now for ice climbing the old BD red Fusion are a really close second to the Nomics. If you find a deal on the old red style get them. I miss the pair I use to have.
998,black-diamond,fusion,5.0,"   My Nomic is a Fusion.   When leashless became the new game and all the companies started pouring out new axes to go outside and overhang on mixed routes~ and when we all started needing more clearance from our ice axes Black Diamond invented the Fusion.    For 5 years now (give or take) they taken me everywhere. Perfect? Untrue. Best tool ever made for dry tooling? Yes~ after a few tweaks.   I started by adding micro hammer heads~ always useful for putting in the ""once in a while"" pitons. And hockey tape on the shaft which was recently replaced by plumber's tape made on some sorta ""stick to itself"" sorta silicone-jelly-fabricky thing.   People around me have been telling this and that about the Nomic being better than a Fusion and everything... And if so? There's too much bickering and naysaying in climbing circle about what works best. Use what works for you.   For me the most important feature of an ice axe is to let me climb ice. Period. The Fusion does that and more~ after a fashion."
999,smc,superblue-hinged-crampons,4.0,   I have only used these for a couple of trips so far~ but here is my experience. The hinged~ strap-on design means they work well with flexible boots (I use L.L. Bean pac boots for winter hiking~ and the crampons have stayed on fine).    They are made of chromoly steel rather than aluminum~ which means they should stay sharp longer even with the occasional patch of bare rock. The straps are reasonably easy to put on with gloves~ stay properly adjusted and are made of a material that does not soak up water and freeze.     I can't comment on how the crampons are for technical ice climbing~ as I only use them for hiking in winter conditions in the White Mountains (hard snow/some icy slopes). For hiking~ beware of the rather long front points--they can trip you up if you're not careful (yes~ I've tripped a couple times with them). However~ that's just a matter of getting used to your equipment.     One thing I would definitely recommend is to have the allen wrench and a few spare screws in your repair kit when using these crampons. Also~ if you can use two screws per crampon rather than just one when assembling them~ do. Here's why: Near the end of a ten-mile hike on Kinsman during which I used the crampons almost the entire way~ the screws attaching the front to the rear piece came loose--I must not have tightened them enough when I put the crampons together.    I only had one screw per crampon because that's how they were assembled when I got them so I assumed that was how it was supposed to be--maybe not! Now I will use two screws per crampon and carry spares just in case.
1000,camp,vector-nanotech,3.5,   I purchased the Nanoteck Cector as a light weight vertical crampon that could cross over into mountaineering. Although there are lighter crampons out there for the vertical world (Petzl Dart and Grivel G20) they don't have replaceable front points~ only replaecable front half.    Okay back on target. There are lighter out there but not by much. The addition of the christmas tree heel spur makes them delightful. My wife loves them because of the size and weight.     Pros: they're light~ adjustable~ have replacement parts and a spur option. The points are shorter on the feet making walking better and safer on ankles.   Cons: The front points don't stick out very far and the secondary points are almost useless. The secondary points aren't made for mixed climbing and don't grab rock edges.    Overall~ I find them a good female (due to size and function) crampon that won't rust~ wont win comps but climbs well. I think they make a great crossover tool for mountaineering and ice climbing.
1001,chouinard-equipment,blue-composite-shaft-ice-axe-curved-pick,5.0,   This ice axe is ergonomic and balanced.   This ice axe is well balanced and has an ergonomic curve to ease its use. Chouinard is an old and well known  company which stays on top in tune with the times. I had a Chouinard/Frost bamboo handle technical axe since 1972; and I recently parted with it.  
1002,chouinard-equipment,blue-composite-shaft-ice-axe-curved-pick,5.0,"   Last of a series of 4 ice tools~ on a ""30+ year test"".   This one lasted longer then the Co did! Sorry Yvon~ me without a ""smart remark somewhere in the short series"" would scare others... (besides~ the incident was nothing to do with you or your co anyway... legalese word games.... my opinion anyway...)   In this 30+ year test drive~ touched on the Simond Chacal~ MacInnes-Peck Terrordactyl~ and the Forest Moljner.  This leaves the High Quality Pretty Blue Chouinard Ice Axe (did it make up for the ""smart remark?"").    Mine is a ""medium length"" so it could cross over between Alpine Axe and Ice Tool. The curved tip holds an edge well and is easy to use for any level of climber. Makes a great glissading axe! Right length to have the pick clear one's chest/torso/pain infliction points and the curved pick is better than the Stubai Aschenbrenner Axe for stopping.    Aschenbrenner~ if you built up enough speed (not that you are supposed to build up a lot of speed before trying to stop...) would start to slow you then~ pop a bit slowing the deceleration process (distance is important when the rocks/point things are getting closer quickly). Slower speeds were not a problem for the Aschenbrenner but in a different league than the Blue Chouinard Axe.    Have run glissading classes with both though~ and passed them around.  Newer tools don't seem to behave any different.    Adze is reasonable to work if you choose to chop steps~ not that I would want to do such a thing.  Have done for a few classes folks to get them the ""hang of it"" then review Frech Technique an Front Point. Alternating to not to be worn out with one or the other~ and steps if one is up for tedium.   Quality and durability~ another ""helmet off"" for such a piece of work. Tried and tested for 30+   Last few years~ have been ""light use"" but all will be put to the test as my son wants to give it a go this winter. Back to the gym for me and another seasonal prep for the tools... that is another plus for each of the ""magic 4"" - not much prep needed.  If properly stowed~ is a grab'n go.   Reliability - simple and always there... at the ready (a touch of the ""KISS"" principle)"
1003,macinnes-peck,terrordactyl,5.0,   Ah... the MacInnes-Peck Terrordactyl.... another of my favorite tools. Came in both adze or hammer face.    I opted for the hammer face as it was too short for cutting steps (had either a Chouinard Blue Shaft Composite or a Stubai Aschenbrenner~ both with long shafts for such tedium).  A metal tool typically with original paint of silver or black.  Spike at the bottom of the shaft with a biner hole (or sling).   A nice steep angle to the pick of good hardness to the metal and high corrosion resistance. No rust after all these years (used~ shelved~ used....). One technique was worked out on how hard to drive it in the various conditions~ was nice to use. Early on~ a few knuckle busting days followed by time spent trying to free it again (did I say it had a good bite?).  Took some getting used to but~ once sorted out you could climb with confidence.  Care must be given for those with mixed routes though.    Unlike the Moljner or the Chacal~ the tip you have is the one and only she has. This is not a changable tip and if you need to keep sharpening~ will whittle it away. You will know when you have whittled too far. Broken or damaged knuckles are a sure tell tale sign. If you can't feel them~ your partner will clearly see and inform you. All the blood dripped on the ice was yours.   Mixed climbs~ were not a problem once technique was sorted out. Need is a good driving point from which many folks learn good technique (simply to survive). Fitting the tip in or doing it rock style worked for many folks.    Have seen trend today for many folks just to wail their tools into cracks and climb on. Only problem there~ if you need sharp tools to help some one injured... keep them sharp and don't abuse them. A Rescue service might be available but time it critically important. This tool will hold a good edge and hold in well. Has made a belay point more than once (did I mention the carabiner hole in the spike end). A tool that can make a climb successful and fun.   Another of the 30+ year test runs - passed with flying colours   MacInnes-Peck - Nice Quality and Durability - passed the test of time (post sore knuckle training)
1004,grivel,racing-wing,5.0,   I wanted a tool that would take me on the ice and~ later~ on rock. The Racing Wings were my best bet. The overall feel is very solid and comfortable. I took a knife and shaved the rubber liners in the handles; they were giving me blisters when used ungloved. The curve of the handle makes the Evolution and Goulotte picks impractical for waterfall use; I learned the hard way.  Swinging the Cascade or Mixte is heavenly. Even carrying the hammer and adze is comfortable; the balance is fantastic. I found that I overswing sometimes and that they stay in place very well.   If I had it to do all over again~ I would still get the Racing Wings~ seconded by the Ta-K-oons (or whatever they're called.) I just like the balance of these axes so much...   I have swung the Simond Anaconda Cups and like them both but realize how aggressive the Racing Wings are.  I feel very confident in the placement of these axes where I would only feel good if swinging the Cups very hard.
1005,grivel,taa-k-oon-alp,5.0,"   This is one of the best tools ever made~ better than most of the chrome-plated crap that's being touted today as the latest and greatest. Yeah~ I said it.   I have personally lead grade 4 ice~ mixed terrain up to m6 as well as several alpine routes with these tools. I added the heavy picks and use cascade picks for just about everything~ but get some of the MIxte picks for rock climbing abuse.  I also removed the 'trigger"" to better resist the Montana chill.   For some reason~ Grivel only made these for a few years then moved on to what they felt were better designs (Monster?) The Taakoon is one of the most well-balanced~ well-engineered tools I have ever climbed with (I've climbed with all of the contemporary designs and several doglegs).   You will need to wear relatively thin gloves and not have big hands to appreciate these gloves.  My brother~ who does have big hands and wears thicker gloves can't really use my tools. He needs the old school Cobras~ but uses Rambo II's.   Grivel tools have always been the best~ this tool is one of the last throwbacks to an era of truly well built tools. If you find one you might want to snatch it up. You might even get it cheap from some rich kid who wants a new french~ leopard-print carbon dogleg b/s p.o.s...."
1006,kahtoola,kts-aluminum-hiking-crampons,5.0,   I purchased these when they first hit the market some years back and have not been disappointed with them.   I've used them winter and spring hiking here in AK and have not had one issue with them at all as far as workmanship goes. The spikes have worn down slightly but~ that is to be expected since I have used the crampons hard in mixed terrain in snow~ rock~ mud~ dirt~ etc. I've put as many as 5 miles a day on these crampons.   The fit is great and they work on a wide variety of boots and shoes from my Keen trail shoes all the way to my Lowa Hunter GTX and Koflach's.   I have a brand new set of the steel version of this which is heavier (only slightly~ maybe a few ounces) but I haven't used them yet. I'll use them when the aluminum version wears out completely.   The BEST thing about these crampons is the stainless leafspring bar. They flex with every step~ making them comfortable and better than crampons which flex on a hinge~ I have seen those other on the hinge break after hard use.   I haven't tried the crampons on my snowboard or XC ski boots but I doubt you would have any issues using them with those boots.   These crampons work well with 40 Below overboots.
1007,camp,ice-rider,4.5,   Good basic alpine crampons. Easy to adjust and wear with boots that work with step in crampons. Come with a good bag and anti-ball plates.     Pros   Cons   This is a review of the camp ice rider auto crampons. I wear them with Scarpa Inverno boots. These must be worn with a rigid mountaineering boot; they won't work with most boots~ even heavy all-leather boots; Camp makes different bindings for other boot styles. Camp also makes more specialized ice climbing crampons. These are for basic winter hiking and climbing.     This shows the basic layout. The red pieces help prevent snow from accumulating under your feet. Basic steel 12 point design. Quite durable.     These are a good~ fairly standard crampon for mountaineering. They are semi-rigid 12 point steel alloy. That means two front points~ six under your forefoot~ and four under your heel. They are durable~ as most good brands of steel crampons are. I haven't experienced any bending or breaking.    The size is easy to adjust~ by lifting a springy aluminum piece at the heel and engaging holes in the steel linking bar that connects the front and the back—no screwdriver or wrench necessary~ which is nice. The heel and toe bails can be adjusted a little forward and backward~ and the rear piece that engages the heel of your boot can be adjusted to help customize the fit. The binding is pretty standard stuff.    This shows the front points and the bail that fits over the front of your boots...   This shows the heel locked onto my winter alpine boots~ Scarpa plastic boots.  Top view of the cramponsBottom view~ attached to my boots   These come with anti-balling plates attached~ and with a nice storage bag. Camp sells longer linking bars if you have larger feet (10 1/2 or higher might need these).    The anti-balling plates are a moderately flexible hard foam—they are permanently attached~ requiring you to bend a few metal pieces to remove them. That is not ideal~ but the only time I removed them was to put in the longer linking bars.   These aren't particularly lightweight~ and they are best suited to mountaineering and mixed terrain~ but not for ice climbing.    Experience   Several years of winter hiking~ White Mountains and Adirondacks.  
1008,forrest,mjolnir,3.5,"   With skye pick~ compares favorably with modern ice tools - best third tool ever   Cons   While tube picks were a fad that was justifiably short-lived~ and the ""alpine"" classic curve pick was nothing to write home about~ the skye pick (pterrordactyl knock-off) is a gem of engineering that still compares favorably with modern ice tools (in my opinion).   In the 2015 season~ I'm still carrying one as a third tool~ although the picks are becoming impossible to find. Anybody out there who has old mjolnir skye picks collecting dust~ I'll buy 'em!  - curthaire@nwi.net"
1009,forrest,mjolnir,5.0,"   Part 3 of a 4 tool~ 30 yr+ Field Test   Hey if they can run cars for a million miles then write a review~ why not the 30+ test on outdoor gear.  If gear is good enough to go the long run and still meet expectations equivalent to today's gear.   First of the run - Simond Chacal~ followed by the MacInnes-Peck Terrordactyl.   This one is on the Forest Moljner of the Colorado Climbing world. Mine is a hammer face. Don't remember if they offered it with an adze.  If yes~ would have been the smallest ever.    As a ice hammer~ works very well. Changeable picks~ much easier than the Chacal~ with only the use of an allen wrench (2 screws). At the start of any/all climbs~ do check for tighness of the screws.  Quick and easy to do. Even faster if you buy a toy biner and get the right size with a ring/loop end on it.  It can then just join your rack or clip on to the harness.  Becomes a 10 second job to check the screws.    Pick choices is droop (curved)~ steep (terrordactyl style) 45 degree~ or tube (full tube) styles.  The curved and 45 are strong enough/durable enough to last many years.  If not beaten into the rock~ will last a lifetime. Sharpening is a bit of an issue as they are harden steel but~ hold the edge well.    Tube pick is a little differnt on ""tip lifetime/wear"".  This is a thin walled tube.  Takes some getting used to~ not to be dinged up.  When the tube tip is first aquired~ before using in the field~ add some epoxy to it.  Tube to bolt up end is like an add on end.    To make it more of a ""finished product"" and keep stuff from geting jambed up in the end (slows the ejection ability too)~ invert and stick in a vice.  The best angle is easly determined and can be changed before completion. You want to make a smooth tube~ filling the void with liquid epoxy.  Goal is a smooth ejection flow of ice and whatever makes its way down the tube.  Once dripped in and at the desired angle~ leave it.  Let it harden at its own speed.  Leave it for a few days~ will last for 30 yrs... well worth the patience early on.  Hard~ solid~ bubble/void free~ easy and cheap to do.    Another reason I paried this up with the Chacal (had gear for 2!) was the wrench used for the Chacal tip change~ ground to a size/shape to help clean tool tips and ice screws (along with threaded rod bent loop style for the rack).   On climbing~ was easy to work with less practice needed than the Terrordactyl for knuckle busting class.  Small size and large in stature~ very versatile. Would have been interesting with a spike but you can't have everything.  It is so short~ spike would likely just been a ""topic of discussion"" and little more.   Forest's Moljner~ has passed with flying colours too!   Another completion of the 30+ yr test drive.   Good quality and durability~ ""Helmet off to Mr. Forest""!"
1010,grivel,nepal-steel,4.0,   This axe has been great for me so far. The durability seems excellent. I've banged it around on rocks and dirt plenty and other than some scratches it's untouched.    I got mine used and expect to continue using it for along time~ but the coating on the pick has come off in places and allows it to rust. This is a purely aesthetic problem but I mention it nonetheless.    I find it easy and comfortable to grip in a variety of ways even with mittens. The pick is nice and long~ and has worked well for me to arrest even in softer snow. The adze is a very comfortable size in hand~ and digs well.         As climbing gear is getting lighter and lighter I see my buddies carrying slightly lighter axes and am occasionally jealous. This axe isn't exactly a brick~ but the Raven Pro and others shave a few ounces.    The weight factor is the only reason I rate it 4/5~ but on durability~ comfort and function it's a 5 for sure.
1011,petzl,ascension,5.0,"   I got the Petzl Ascension ascender to replace my prussik cords for jugging fixed lines. In my search~ I tried out numerous types of ascending devices such as the Black Diamond nForce and the Petzl Tibloc~ but the Ascension stood out as the best piece for the job.   I picked the left handed version so that I switch from using the ""double ascender"" method of jugging to the ascender/grigri method when I got enough money to guy the grigri.   I also carry it along in case I need to perform a self rescue.      The Good:   The best feature of the Ascension that makes it stand out over the competitors is how smoothly it slides up and down the climbing rope. Also~ the thumb trigger makes the device very easy on and off the rope as you pass up gear placements while cleaning aid pitches.   The device itself has two attachment points on the bottom of the device~ which are plenty big to fit even large carabiners into~ and the holes at the top of the device allow you to create a 3-to-1 pulley system with a loose carabiner for taking in slack with the ascender/grigri method.   This feature has proven extremely useful when installing or removing bolts on sport routes. Weight is another plus to the ascension~ weighing in at 196 grams (less than other competitors of similar shape). One of the cool features I like to use the ascension for is self-belaying on a fixed top rope line as opposed to using a locking pulley.   The Bad:   Some of my climbing partners commented that the hole at the bottom was not large enough to rotate a locking carabiner 360 degrees~ but I don't see this as being an issue that I will ever have to deal with.   Overall:   Overall I am totally satisfied with the Petzl Ascension. It meets all my needs and offers great versatility either climbing~ caving~ or jugging. I would highly recommend this product if you are in the market for an ascender."
1012,petzl,ascension,5.0,   This is a great ascender.   Pros   Cons   This is my favorite handled ascender.  I own three of them. One is retired~ and has over 150~000' of rope work on it. The teeth were starting to get too thin~ so I replaced it with a new one. The ascender still bites due to Petzl's great design!
1013,petzl,ascension,5.0,"   The Petzl Ascension is the only foot ascender on the market worth looking at. Although the price is a bit higher~ I have known cavers who regretted trying cheaper alternatives. If you are new to rope work~ Petzl is the brand to buy...period!   Pros   Cons   So~ I have said the same thing on my Petzl Croll review~ but in a ""Frog"" ascending system~ the Croll and Ascension are both critical components. You can't safely have one without the other.   The Petzl Ascention is the only foot ascender I've ever used for caving. It works right every time. I can set and remove it while wearing gloves. It holds on wet~ gritty rope. I literally have trusted my life to it scores of times.   Petzl tends to be a bit pricier than other other brands~ but I have caved with people frustrated with the performance of their cheaper buys.   The photo below is of me hanging on the Ascension over a cave pit~ approximately 60' off the pit floor. I'm switching over to my rappel rack in order to descend.   As I state in many of my reviews~ rope work in a cave is dangerous. One should not just pick up a bunch of equipment and go try it out. Join a caving club (called a ""Grotto"" and found at www.caves.org) and learn from them. It is also wise to find out what your local Grotto is using in caves. If you are using a system they are unfamiliar with~ it will be difficult for them to assist you~ should you get into trouble (and~ yes~ cavers get into trouble on ropes all the time)."
1014,petzl,pantin,5.0,"   Does what it is supposed to do quite well.    Pros   Cons   I have been using the Patin for years as a supplement to my Frog Ascension.   Normally~ when you start out ascending a rope~ you have to pinch the rope between your feet to get started. This is because~ until you get a good 10' off the ground~ there is not enough weight on the rope to automatically pull it through the ascenders. Pinching the rope with construction boots on can be a task~ and a climber can expend a lot of energy in the initial ascent.   The Pantin eliminates the need to pinch the rope. It connects to your boot~ and all you have to do is step up. The cam engages and up you go!      It is important to note that the Pantin is NOT rated as a life-supporting device. It cannot take the place of a foot and chest ascender. It is simply a convenient way to start your climb without wasting energy.   Note Pantin on left foot in photo:   As with all Petzl products I have owned~ the quality of the Pantin is exceptional. I have used this device dozens (scores?) of times in extremely muddy and wet conditions. After 8 years~ it is still in excellent condition and ready to go. Because it is not a life-supporting device~ I am less concern with the ""retirement age"" of the webbing that connects under the boot and around the ankle.   The Pantin is NOT an ""essential"" piece of a frog system. I know many cavers who don't bother with using this unit. They cite it is one more piece of equipment to deal with in a system where everything needs to ""hum along"" to work well. While I agree understand their point of view~ I personally want to conserve my energy for the long climbs.   As I state in many of my reviews~ rope work in a cave is dangerous. One should not just pick up a bunch of equipment and go try it out. Join a caving club (called a ""Grotto"" and found at www.caves.org) and learn from them. It is also wise to find out what your local Grotto is using in caves. If you are using a system they are unfamiliar with~ it will be difficult for them to assist you~ should you get into trouble (and~ yes~ cavers get into trouble on ropes all the time. Usually~ it's not a big deal~ but then others wind up in the obituary section~ because they didn't know what they were doing.)"
1015,petzl,croll,5.0,"   As a component in rope ascending~ the Petzl Croll continues to be the best on the market. It is easy to use~ even while wearing gloves. It holds true on wet~ gritty rope. I have trusted my life to this item numerous times and will continue to do so.    Pros   Cons   Petzl's ascenders are the only ones I've ever used for caving. They work right every time. I can set and remove them while wearing gloves. I literally have trusted my life with them scores of times. Petzl tends to be a bit pricier than other other brands~ but I'll stick with the leader when it comes to my safety.   The Croll is designated as a ""chest ascender."" This may cause some confusion~ as it actually attaches to your harness at your waist. However~ it is held in place by either a chest harness or a piece of webbing running up and over the shoulders. As a climber ""frogs"" up the rope~ the Croll sits primarily at the bottom of the sternum.   The photo is me ascending out of Rumbling Falls Cave. My hand is gripping the Petzl Ascension. You can see the gold Petzl Croll at my chest.   In a pinch~ the Croll could be configured as a different ascending device~ but it lacks the convenient handle on dedicated foot ascenders.   As I state in many of my reviews~ rope work in a cave is dangerous. One should not just pick up a bunch of equipment and go try it out. Join a caving club (called a ""Grotto"" and found at www.caves.org) and learn from them. It is also wise to find out what your local Grotto is using in caves. If you are using a system they are unfamiliar with~ it will be difficult for them to assist you~ should you get into trouble (and~ yes~ cavers get into trouble on ropes all the time. Usually~ it's not a big deal~ but then others wind up in the obituary section~ because they didn't know what they were doing.)"
1016,petzl,tibloc,4.5,"   I first saw this device in a climbing mag. As a rescue tech~ I/we are always looking to try out new ideas~ especially when they are this inexpensive and LIGHT!   The Tibloc can be used as an emergency ascender on single rope up to 11mm (I've used it on 12mm with no probs.) and also as a makeshift locking pulley for hauling systems like the Z-rig. Works best with an oval or HMS carabiner with a round body.   Plus side: Super simple~ can't be removed from rope unless the attaching biner is removed also~ inexpensive~ small enough to carry unnoticed on any rack. Great self rescue back up ICO emergency.   Minus: Not rated for double loads found in rescue~ teeth MAY wear rope (they haven't for me yet)~ small size make it easy to drop~ especially if wearing gloves - tether it with a length of accessory cord. Not a stand alone piece - requires a carabiner to complete the system.   I keep one (or two) of these with my rescue gear~ tree climbing kit~ and my rock bag.   I rated this product high because I believe it's one of those ""Don't leave home without it"" kind of emergency items."
1017,petzl,shunt,1.0,"   Unnecessary~ ""psychological"" backup.   Pros   Cons   I was terrified of rappelling and ascending ropes 14 years ago. So I bought the Shunt as a ""back up"" in case I messed up a rappel.   The Shunt connects from your harness to the rope above your rappel device. To descend~ you must use your non-dominate hand to hold open the cam. If you let go~ the cam slams shut~ pinching the rope and halting your descent.   To that end~ this device works fine.   HOWEVER~ human nature in a fall is to grab hold and squeeze tighter. In a panic situation~ a person does not unconsciously let go (next time you're with a driver who slams on the brakes~ notice your clenched fists afterwards). So in order for the Shunt to actually work~ you have to intentionally let go at a moment when your nature reaction is to squeeze tighter.   The Shunt gave me the initial psychological security I needed to get use to rope work. But once I became familiar and accustomed to my equipment~ I realized how useless this piece of equipment really is.   Save your money and take a quality rappelling class!"
1018,petzl,shunt,5.0,   I highly recommend the Shunt. Use with extreme caution like any piece of equipment.      Warning: Never attach a lanyard to the little hole at the back to be used as a 'Tow Line'!      Pros   Cons   Warning : Never attach a Lanyard to the little hole at the back to be used as a 'Tow Line'!   I use the Shunt for top roping usually with extended friction hitch backup above the Shunt~ which is itself extended from the belay loop. Sometimes I use the Shunt for leg loop placement descending backup instead of a friction hitch.
1019,singing-rock,puller-chest-ascender-harness,4.0,"   An important part of any ascension system~ the Singing Rock Puller Chest Harness is well-made and dependable. I have owned several of these units~ retiring them as age requires. They are still available in climbing stores and well worth the few bucks.    Pros   Cons   Singing Rock is a great company~ and this is a great item to use with a Frog Ascension System. The harness keeps your chest ascender (I prefer Petzl's Croll) in place on a climb. Without it~ a climber would risk the ascender disconnecting from the rope.   Many cavers make their own chest harness out of webbing. I like using a pre-made harness~ because it's easily adjustable~ and I can loan it out to someone who forgot to bring one.   In this photo you can see the gold chest harness crossing my shoulder and back.   Vertical caving is a dangerous sport. Before investing in a bunch of gear~ get with a local caving club (Called a ""Grotto"" and listed at www.caves.org) and learn what they are using and what they recommend.  Never do vertical work alone!"
1020,singing-rock,footer-ascender-sling,4.0,"   The Singing Rock Footer Ascender Sling is a quality~ adjustable foot tape that allows those using a Frog ascending system to set the right length for climbing rope. As with all Sing Rock equipment I have used~ I find it reasonably priced and well worth considering.   Pros   Cons   At the heart of a ""Frog"" rope ascension system is a foot ascender~ with its accompanying foot lanyard. The foot ascender has two lines coming off of it. The first~ is the life supporting lanyard that attaches to the harness. The second is a critical (but non-life supporting) foot tape~ like the Singing Rock.   Stock store image.   In the picture below~ my friend Ralph has his right hand on a Petzl foot ascender. The rope he is climbing is to the right (coming at his chest~ then falling between his feet). A yellow-ish tether is in the middle of the triangle~ running to his harness. The line to the left is his foot tape~ which runs down to his left foot.    And here is an illustrated demo:   I started off with the Singing Rock Footer Ascender Sling~ because I was too new to trust my own DIY project. I somehow believed I would need the adjustable nature of the foot tape. However~ once you ""dial in"" the length to your body~ you really don't need to ever readjust it. The adjustable loop is convenient for sharing this foot tape with another climber.   Overall~ the Singing Rock served me well for several years. When it was time to retire it~ I found I could easily make my own with some prussic cord.   The Singing Rock Footer Ascender Sling is a good product for someone new to rope work. I would recommend it as you begin this type of adventure.   As I state in many of my reviews~ rope work in a cave is dangerous. One should not just pick up a bunch of equipment and go try it out. Join a caving club (called a ""Grotto"" and found at www.caves.org) and learn from them. It is also wise to find out what your local Grotto is using in caves. If you are using a system they are unfamiliar with~ it will be difficult for them to assist you~ should you get into trouble (and~ yes~ cavers get into trouble on ropes all the time)."
1021,petzl,adjama,5.0,"   I've climbed in this harness for five years.  Top~ lead~ triad~ though I'm a cleaner~ and it has never disappointed me.   It is extremely comfortable. I am 5'9"" and about 200 pounds and has never pinch or pulled in an uncomfortable manner.   The harness has held up extremely well.  I am not as easy on my gear as I should be~ as it holds my life in its hands.   I would and will most definitely purchase again."
1022,petzl,adjama,5.0,   Great harness~ I would not upgrade if you paid me. Low profile rear and front gear loop stay out of the way with my pack on.    I climb in the AZ heat~ this one give me the ventilation I need. I am 120 lbs and 4’11 male. The small fits wonderful. The adjustable leg loops and waist make it a “no hassle” to get in and out of~ when I go back Northeast and have to put on more layers for warmth.     All and all this is the bang for you buck. 
1023,petzl,adjama,5.0,   Great harness. It is really comfortable~ and I really like the quick tighten feature~ rather than having to always double back. I wish it had two more loops for trad but having two of the different types of loops is nice. Mine has taken a couple falls and still feels good. Great harness!
1024,petzl,adjama,4.0,   Light~ pretty comfortable~ good for trad and sport (I’m 165 pound male). I like the gear loops: combination of smaller rigid plastic and floppy but huge loops for the back two. It would have been more comfortable for me if I could have combined the waist belt off a small and the leg loops off a medium. The stitching is very clever - minimizes material but supportive. I like the auto double back buckles.     Design of the back is much improved over the earlier version but still dumb. I don't understand their stubbornness over leaving out a haul loop. The strap to hold up the leg loops sometimes comes unhooked - but not during climbing (more when I take it off  / fidget / wear a pack).    I tied a small double loop of cord through the funky fabric cutouts at the back and it works great to clip my chalk bag with a biner.    Overall~ I’d recommend the Petzl Adjama.  
1025,petzl,corax,5.0,   It's easy to fit it—two pull straps at the waist~ a little tug~ and voila the harness is locked in. Comfy too.   Pros   Cons   I bought the Corax harness kit complete with a harness~ belay device~ carabiner~ chalk bag and chalk.  Easy to put on and adjust to fit. Just step into the harness~ pull each side of the waist belt~ and voila a perfect fit with the harness perfectly centered.   Great to get the added bonus of the belay~ carabiner~ chalk bag and chalk for just a bit more. I shopped online and got the kit for $74 minus a 10% discount. Light~ the items in the kit are good quality. which means it won't weigh or wear you down on those treks to the rock wall.   Only downside is I like a little style in terms of color and they just come in gray. I know it sounds stupid but I'd like to match my hemet color.   One other note~ when I found the kit I still thought it was a bit expensive so I emailed the website and got an additional 10% off just to close the deal. So fellow climbers~ don't be afraid to ask for additional price concessions. The worst that can happen is they say no and you're no worse off.  Keep in mind that not all websites charge tax and not all charge for shipping if you meet an initial price point.
1026,petzl,corax,4.0,   Very comfy harness~ and only slightly more expensive than the BD Momentum. Works well for sitting on belay on a long multipitch as well as catching long lead falls without too much effort. All around a super capable harness.   Pros   Ease of Use: Same basic design as pretty much all sport harnesses. Easy to reach harness gear loops.   Features: Everything preforms well and leaves little to be desired.   Construction & Durability: As with all Petzl products~ quality is top notch! Has held up well after months of abuse from me.   Conditions: Used inside~ outside~ on the mountain~ and for ice climbing. In all kinds of weather it has been spectacular!
1027,petzl,corax,4.0,   Has great comfort easily adjusted with two tightening points.   Pros   Cons   One of my favourite features is the two buckles~ which make it a little heavier than some harnesses but allows for a greater adjustability and easier to get on and off without having extremely long tails. The soft gear loops at the back make carrying a pack easier~ which makes it great for canyoning which at this point in time has been my primary use of the harness.
1028,petzl,corax,5.0,   Very versatile~ well padded~ light and comfortable. You do not go wrong if you pick Corax.
1029,petzl,corax,4.5,"   Got a killer deal on this harness. Wasn't planning on keeping it but it was so comfy I had to. Plenty of extra padding over my friend's harnesses. Doesn't feel or look cheap. Plenty of gear loops. Durability on the gear loops may be questionable~ we'll see.    I'm a 5'11"" guy and got the size ""1"" which seems to fit perfectly~ even though I have to tighten the waist loop pretty much all the way. Another quality product from Petzl."
1030,petzl,corax,4.5,"   I would have given this harness a ""5"" but I've only used one other harness~ the Black Diamond Momentum. The harness is lightweight~ easy to use~ easy to adjust~ and the waist belt is extra plush and soft. Plenty of room for tools. For this price point you can't go wrong with Corax 2."
1031,black-diamond,alpine-bod,4.0,   I bought two of these accidentally. I don't know if the retailer made the mistake or me but I am glad for the error.    I have five kids ranging in ages from 3-12.  The 12-yr-old is too old for this but the 3-~ 5-~ 7- and 10-yr-olds all can fit this harness fine. Two makes things faster because of less time spent swapping harnesses.   The back padding is fleece which I thought was kinda cheesy but it actually does fine for the kiddos. They shipped two with different color padding so the kids claimed one as their own.    The fleece is kinda grabby so the little ones can't slip out with their narrow hips. The 10-yr-old puts his own on just fine (always double check of course). None of them have ever expressed discomfort wearing it and they often hang in it for longer than I would want to in my own harness. The problem is that they forget they are wearing it and run off at the crag with the harness on and forget to leave it for their siblings.    The 10-yr-old follows 5.9 sport climbs just fine with it and I like all of its features. The belay loop is nice and stiff and it has gear loops just like dad's. I can't think of a reason to dislike it yet.     PARENTS: For your littlest climbers use a piece of webbing and make a figure 8 chest harness to keep these top-heavy kids from capsizing in a fall. Though unlikely in toproping~ it's still a good idea.    Update 08/2015: Still fits the youngest two kids. Great harness~ still happy!
1032,black-diamond,alpine-bod,5.0,"   I started rock climbing fairly recently and bought this for my first harness. I really like it and can't see myself buying a different one unless this one wears out. I use it primarily for simpler~ single-pitch routes and have had no issues with safety~ durability~ or comfort.     I think the best thing about this harness is that it is also very versatile. I'm a ""gear junkie"" with way more hobbies than I can afford. It's nice having a harness that can be used for rock-climbing~ mountaineering~ scrambling~ via ferrata~ etc.     If you're a hardcore rockclimber with a little extra cash~ you may want to experiment with some fancier harnesses. If you need something simple~ affordable~ and functional~ be confident that this harness will do the job great."
1033,black-diamond,alpine-bod,4.0,   Mine is the older model~ gear loops have been added now. I find this harness has been adequate for alpine climbing and I have done low class rock climbing with it too. One advantage is that it is simple and lightweight. Another advantage is that it is adjustable because I seem to gain weight and use more clothing in the winter. It is as safe as any certified~ approved harness. Because it has no padding it isn't comfortable to hang in for more than a few minutes. It has no belay loop~ but that hasn't been a problem. It depends on what you use it for~ but for my purposes~ so far~ it has been great. 
1034,black-diamond,big-gun,4.5,   I've been climbing in the Big Gun harness for a little over a year now. I used to hang in it for about 8 hours a day~ most weekdays~ at my old job. It did incredibly well for distributing weight so my back wasn't killing me.   My ONE complaint (and it is actually a big complaint) is that it needs TWO waist buckles so that the gear loops and bullhorn waist belt are centered. As it is~ everything is offset~ and you have to shift your harness whenever you stop hanging and start climbing again.   Other than that~ I love this harness. I use it for trad climbing~ and usually for sport climbing too cause I can belay for hours and never get tired.
1035,black-diamond,big-gun,4.5,   Just got done with the first climbs using the BD Big Gun. I tired on several harnesses after my Metolius finally started showing signs of wear. The Arc'Teryx proved to be very light by may cause broken ribs if you take a screamer.   These harnesses are at very opposite extremes and I was somewhat suspect of the mobility of the Big Gun until I climbed with it. For all the padding the Big Gun does well on sport climbs and the gear loops are amazing for setting up your rack and very comfy two.    This is not a sport cragers ideal harness but if you're looking to spending time on multi-pitch trad routes I would definitely recommend the Big Gun for its comfort~ durability~ and organization.
1036,mammut,ophir-harness,5.0,   Currently this is my favorite harness. This harness is very comfortable and it is very easy to put on and adjust. The gear loops are sturdy and easy to find and it includes a handy haul loop.   Pros   Cons   This is my third harness and I have taken it from the gym to the red rocks of Moab and I love it.   It does not have adjustable leg loops which are quite comfortable and make putting the harness on very quick and easy. The buckle does not need to be looped back through making the waist adjustment quicker and allows you to make minor adjustments with ease.    It has four coated gear loops that are easy to clip things on and off of them. It has a single haul loop in the back that works great.    The harness seems quite durable and over the two years I have had it I see very little wear. There is a wear indicator in the belay loop so you know when it's time to replace.
1037,petzl,hirundos,4.5,   This is a fantastic~ extremely light~ comfortable harness. Targeted originally for high end sport climbing (and still used for that)~ it has also gained popularity as an alpine harness~ which is what I use it for in addition to all-day trad rock.   Despite the absence of adjustable leg loops (which would increase the weight anyways)~ I find it works very well for any and all types of climbing. Petzl wisely put ice-clipper slots on the waist belt in anticipating the needs of the alpine/ice climber. As always with Petzl~ the quality and construction is outstanding.  I particularly love the simplicity of this harness...the buckle is of the single-pull~ no-need-to-thread-back type....as such~ I put on the harness~ tighten the fit~ and there is nothing else to think about (except of course tying in properly).   My only reason for 4.5 stars vs. 5 are: a) ice clipper slot on one side is positioned awkwardly~ i.e. too far back~ and b) I really wish Petzl would start putting a haul loop on the backs of their harnesses. Zip line/tag line/haul line use is pretty common (except of course in sport climbing)~ and the presence of a narrow spectra haul loop would increase cost and weight slightly~ but significantly increase utility in my opinion.   Regardless~ I highly recommend this harness - you won't be disappointed.
1038,black-diamond,couloir,4.0,   I guess it depends on what you're using it for. If you want something to keep you comfortable while hanging around in the rock climbing gym~ this is really too light for regular use.   While I do a bit of that~ the main reason I bought the Couloir is for glacier travel~ and for fall rescue and recovery in an emergency. As a hiking guide in the Rockies~ there is sometimes a chance that someone will slip or fall~ and I need to carry a kit~ including a rope and harness.   Because this one is so light and compact~ I can actually carry it without it being too much of a nuisance. Packs down to about the size of a pop can.
1039,black-diamond,couloir,4.5,   The Black Diamond Couloir harness has all the features you need for a glacier travel or mountaineering~ and none of the features you don't.   Pros   Cons   I have used this harness for about 40 days for glacier travel and mountaineering and it has held up to use and abuse well.   The harness is lightweight with no padding~ which is ideal for glacier travel and mountaineering when you only would need it for a rescue scenario. You'll be wearing it almost the whole time so you want it to be lightweight~ low profile (so it fits under a backpack strap)~ and have it pack down small for when you don't need it.   It can be uncomfortable hanging from this harness due to the lack of padding~ but since you're not planning on hanging from this harness~ the padding would just be extra weight/bulk.   This harness is easy to use once you figure it out. If you're a girl~ you can go to the bathroom without taking it off.   The harness has two thin gear loops which I found adequate for putting extra biners~ prussiks~ anchor cord~ webbing~ and the occasional ice screw on. Black Diamond also sells ice clippers~ which are basically plastic caribiners that stay on your harness on special attachment points just to organize your ice screws.   The only gripe I have with it is you have to double back the main strap which can be hard~ especially if your hands are cold~ wet~ or have gloves covering them.
1040,black-diamond,wiz-kid,4.0,   My little brother is just plain in love with it. It's comfortable~ has enough gear loops for him to carry the draws he needs and all in all it's perfect for a child.   Only drawback is that as soon as he grows the single buckle system will place the gear loops in an awkward position. A double gear buckle front fastening system would solve much of that problem. 
1041,black-diamond,wiz-kid,4.5,   Great kids harness. I bought two for my kids. We have a wall in the house and many kids have used the harnesses. The pre-threaded speed buckles are so easy even the kids can use them no problem.     Pros:      Easy to use~ and very adjustable for all sizes of kids. Solid belay loop~ easy to tie in~ good padding~ and it just looks cool.    Cons:      Small legs have a hard time cinching down because of the size of the leg loops and padding. I have had a hard time with getting a good fit on some of the girls.    I would recommend this harness to anyone. Definitely have your child try it on to make sure of fit around waist and legs.
1042,black-diamond,momentum-al,5.0,"   First harness I ever bought and after all this time I still find myself going back to this harness.   Pros   Cons   This harness works great! It's easy to take on and off and everything works just like it should. The four gear loops can store enough draws for a day of sport climbing or all your nuts~ draws~ and cams for trad.    The Momentum AL harness gives all climbers the comfort and durability that Black Diamond is known for. The harness has a traditional waistbelt buckle and adjustable leg loops~ which uses a simple slide adjuster to provide a wide range of fit.   From the Black Diamond website: ""The waistbelt is built with our Dual Core Construction~ which uses two slim bands of high-tensile webbing on the outer edges of the waistbelt and a venting OpenAir foam insert in the center to offer breathable~ lightweight comfort without pressure points."" And it lives up to all of this. I have never had a single problem with the fit of this harness.   Even after scraping this harness on rock and holds alike~ I haven't had a problem with fraying or loose stitching. Overall~ everything on this harness is extremely well made and easy to use. The only thing I don't like is the double-backing~ but not enough to not give it five stars.   I've used this harness on weekend trips to Sandrock~ Foster Falls~ and Yonah and also every time I climb indoors; I have yet to have any problems! I would recommend this harness to anyone!"
1043,black-diamond,momentum-al,5.0,   This is my first harness and it's great. I thought I'd have to spend a lot more to get something this nice. I don't expect to buy a new harness for a long time.   Pros   Cons   I went to the store and tried on a few different harnesses and the Black Diamond Momentum AL was just as comfortable as the more expensive ones. It's a simple design but has a few nice features that make me glad I bought it.   The gear loops are bent out from your body which makes it easier to clip to one-handed and without looking.   The leg straps have elastic tensioners that tighten easily but still don't constrict your thighs.   The only bad thing about it is that it can be a pain to get the waist really tight. Once you have it tightened and doubled-backed though~ it feels secure and doesn't loosen.    I've only used this harness on two days of climbing so far~ but there is no sign of wear. It's a Black Diamond~ so I expect it'll hold up well.
1044,black-diamond,momentum-al,4.0,   Most of the time I love this harness. It's solid and well built~ but on a hanging belay this harness really could us some improvement with the padding placement.
1045,black-diamond,momentum-al,4.0,"   Feels good~ comfortable to just sit in as well as climb in. Would have liked a little extra webbing for the waist fastening though as it's a pretty tight fit (I'm a 34"" toned waist and it's very snug) and the buckles are not quick to tighten (not a major problem unless you're planning on taking it off and on a lot).   Not sure what the elastic velcro bit is for at the front~ doesn't seem to fit a purpose especially as when you stretch it open to put it on~ it detaches~ and when it's attached~ it doesn't seem to do a great deal...   All in all though~ I'm very happy with it."
1046,black-diamond,momentum-al,4.5,   Sweet Harness. It is my first harness. I have had it for almost two years. I use it for both alpine and rock climbing. It seems to be holding up nicely.   Pros:   Some padding~ fairly light~ plenty of gear loops~ easy to put on and adjust.   Cons:    If you are hanging from it for a long time~ not enough padding where you need it.     I would buy it again. The price is right.
1047,black-diamond,momentum-al,5.0,   This is a great harness. It was my first one ever to own. It is very comfortable I hardly have any problems with it. I can also adjust the straps around the legs which was a big feature for me that I liked.    I would recommend this harness so anyone who is looking to get started in climbing. It is great and is a reasonable price.
1048,black-diamond,momentum-al,4.0,   A great harness. It has served me well for over a year now. It has everything you need~ plus comfort. I have already recommended to many of my friends and they have all had nothing but good to say as well.
1049,black-diamond,momentum-sa,5.0,"   Fantastic~ reasonably priced harness.   Pros   Cons   I was able to spend the day climbing at an indoor gym today with four of my students (12 & 13year olds) and another instructor.  Everyone used the Momentum SA harness.   For first time climbers~ the harness was straightforward.  It was easy to put on and adjust.  I have used several BD Bod harnesses for the past 15 years or so.  My latest version should have been retired last year~ so when presented with the opportunity to try the SA~ I jumped at the chance.   The harness is very easy to put on.  The ""Speed Buckle"" at the waist is pre-threaded~ meaning you can't un-do the belt portion of the harness~ all you can do is tighten it.  The leg loops have these sliders attached to elastic webbing that are very easy to tighten~ and loosen a little when it's your turn to belay.  Two gear loops are located on each side towards the rear.     The only negative I could find is in the haul loop.  I had no problem hanging my chalk bag from it and accessing it with either hand.  Two of my students~ however~ had a hard time reaching it and had to hang their chalk bags from one of the gear loops.   I am 5' 9"" and weigh 145.  The medium was close to being too large.  When I buy one~ I'll probably get a small.   All in all~ I had a great day climbing thanks to a harness that seamed to disappear when I wasn't belaying or on the wall."
1050,dmm,renegade-2,4.5,   Not the lightest or the comfiest harness out there~ but if you're looking for a good all rounder~ this is possibly the best one on the market!   Pros   Cons   DMM's Renegade 2 is an upgrade to the previous version in both aesthetics and functionality. They ditched the plastic gear loops for the better handling fabric ones~ changed the color from a dismal grey to a fresh looking red trim and added a floating waist belt to allow a more adjustable fit~ whatever your body shape.   Harness don't really have a huge amount of room for drastic innovation but DMM has managed to come up with some neat features that certainly make it more versatile.   Separate elasticated leg bands may not sound very interesting~ but when you need to go the bathroom on a big wall~ you'll soon see the beauty in them. Adding a little extra padding also sounds a little mundane~ but after sitting in a harness for 5 hours or taking the same whip 30 or 40 times in a day~ you'll appreciate the little things that go into making this possibly the best all round harness our there.   Cost: $$$At close to $100 RRP~ this harness needs to provide a lot and to compete with the competition and I feel it delivers in both performance and versatility. Being designed as an all rounder~ it's certainly not the lightest harness but it is comfortable and loaded with neat features.   Performance: 4/5I've used this harness in a ton of scenarios from overhanging sport climbs~ to bolting big walls and trad multi-pitch~ each time performing better than I expected. The 7 gear loops make organising gear a breeze and due to its thick padded waist~ you don't suffer from the dreaded harness sag whether I'm loaded up with my bolting gear or a big wall rack.   The only downside to this harness is that it doesn't have a dedicated haul line attachment which although isn't very useful for the majority~ It's a huge advantage when climbing big routes.Value: 5/5DMM are world renowned for producing the very best quality gear~ created to a meticulously high standard and this is no exception. I've put this harness through hell and back and it has no signs of wear or tear.   Disclosure: The reviewer received a sample of this product from the brand or its representatives in exchange for a review.
1051,mammut,togir-light,4.5,   Harness is lightweight and durable. It allows for great flexibility and ease of movement. Leg straps are elastic loaded providing perfect fit for legs and saving time.   Pros   Cons   I have used this harness both indoors and outdoors (New England Sport climbing) for about two years. I regularly climb 5.12+ and this harness works great for difficult leg movement and harness does not bunch or feel uncomfortable while climbing.  It is lightweight but feels durable as well. The leg straps are elastic loaded saving you time from having to adjust the straps manually.    The only thing I don't like about this harness is that it can feel somewhat uncomfortable while belaying~ but what harness doesn't feel uncomfortable at times while belaying. I do wish there was a double back option for the waist strap. I only say this for peace of mind~ I have never had the strap buckle slip at all.   Overall a great product from Mammut and I recommend it to climbers looking for a lightweight harness.  
1052,singing-rock,digger-cave-harness,4.5,   The Digger Cave Harness is a low-cost~ no frills caving harness that does the job it is suppose to do. While it does not carry the marketing power of Petzl~ there are several features that make this harness worth considering.   Pros   Cons   A Bit About Cave Harnesses   The function of a cave harness necessitates a different design from a traditional climbing harness. While rock climbers are ascending a rock face~ primarily relying on the harness to catch them in a fall~ cavers are actually climbing the rope~ being fully committed to the harness during the descent and return to the surface (See pic #1.).   Pic 1: On the ascent~ a caver is either “frogging” up a rope in a sit/stand motion~ or sitting in the harness in a rope walker set up.   Because ascending a rope via mechanical ascenders involves a limited range of motion (the caver's own height)~ the attachment point for a cave harness needs to be much lower than a traditional climbing harness. Where a climbing harness' belay loop is at the navel~ a cave harness' attachment point is below the top of the hip bones (See pic #2.).   Pic 2: Low attachment point~ with Stainless Steel Maillon   Additionally~ the normal webbing belay loop is replaced with a steel or aluminum maillon. The reason for this is two-fold: 1) In a sit/stand ascent~ the caver is seeking to eliminate as much play in the system as possible to make each step more efficient (For this reason~ cavers also you static/low-stretch rope~ rather than traditional dynamic/high-stretch climbing rope.)~ and 2) Cavers have much more equipment using the attachment point than a rock climber (See pic #3.).   Pic 3: Equipment from left to right: Rappel Rack~ Chest Ascender~ Cows' Tails (splits off to Foot Ascender and either a backup Carabiner attachment or an optional Quick Attach Safety)   Finally~ because one is often squeezing through tight passages with jagged rocks~ caving harnesses are designed to have a minimalist profile and be abrasion resistant. They are not padded to avoid having padding soaking up water—a soaking wet harness is much more uncomfortable than an unpadded harness.   On to the review...   __________________________________________________________________________   The harness does a good job balancing price with functionality. There are higher priced models that I feel are more about name recognition than simply quality (I feel this way about The North Face products and John Deere lawn mowers!). There are cheaper models that work well~ but lack some of the features offered.   Gear Loops   Some cave harnesses forgo gear loops altogether—the less hanging off of your harness~ the less chance of getting hung up. The Digger harness balances this by providing a minimalist gear loop on each side. A caver can then choose to clip in a spare carabiner to have a larger “loop” to hang gear from (See Pic #4.).   Pic 4: Minimalist gear loop holdsone carabiner~ allowing more gear to be hung off the 'biner.   “Idiot Proof” Tabs   When I was new to vertical caving~ an old timer gave me this advice~ “Never cave with someone too arrogant to let you double check their harness.” This means~ you always have someone make sure you doubled-back your harness straps.   A nice feature of the Digger harness are small pieces of abrasion-resistant vinyl that tuck into the buckles after straps are doubled-back. The primary purpose of these pieces are to provide protection to the straps against sharp rocks. However~ because they cannot be used unless the buckle is doubled-back properly~ they provide a means of instantly knowing if the harness is safe to use (See Pics #5 & #6.).   Pic 5: If the vinyl is hanging out~ there is a chance the strap has not been doubled-back properly.   Pic 6: Clear indication the strap is properly doubled-back.   More Abrasion Protection   In addition to the vinyl tabs mentioned above~ vinyl sleeves are sewn around both legs~ fully covering the portion of the harness that is being rubbed the most from the sit/stand motion of the ascent (See Pic #7.).   Pic 7: The lighter colored yellow are the abrasion-resistant vinyl tabs and sleeves.   Too Much Harness?   This is a one-size-fits-most harness~ and that leaves a lot of leftover tail at the waist and legs (See Pic #8.). Honestly~ I do not see how anyone big enough to fill out this harness would ever be able to use it—rope ascension is not for the average XL-sized person.   While the simple solution might be to just cut off the excess webbing~ those who follow my exploits know I have lost 46 lbs in the last 18 months~ and I do not want to make any permanent modifications to any of my gear in case I put some of that weight back on. So as a non-permanent modification~ I removed elastic keeper bands from a retired climbing harness and have found a way to manage the excess nicely (See Pics #9 & #10.).   Pic 8: Lots of tail on the straps.   Pics 9 & 10: Elastic keeper bands keep the tails out of my way.   The Digger Cave Harness has served me well underground for more than a year~ and I hope to have many more adventures with it in the year ahead.

1053,singing-rock,digger-cave-harness,4.0,"   This harness is from Singing Rock~ not CMI. It is similar to the CMI Cavemaster.   Pros   Cons   I have been using this harness since it became available in the U.S. I also own the CMI Cavemaster.   This one is my ""Go-To"" cave harness and is lower priced than the Cavemaster."
1054,arcteryx,i340a-harness,3.5,   A very lightweight harness that is useful for a broad range of activities.   Pros   Cons   I've had a I 340a harness for two years now. It's been my go-to for a lot of different activities. I've used it for pretty much every alpine style climb I've been on. From days climbing ice at the crag around Canmore~ to big multiday glacier ski mountaineering trips across the Wapta~ mountaineering trips up neve gullies on Mt. Matier~ to alpine rock on Bugaboo Spire this harness has seen it all.   Its chief success is that it is very lightweight and packable. The whole harness fits down into a bag that is less than a litre of volume~ making it just a tad bigger then a specialty ultralight harness. Despite this it is a robust harness that shows only minor signs of wear despite its significant use. The soft inner material feels good and breathes well in summer~ and I've never had a problem of saturation in winter.    The dual buckles are easy to get into~ and take apart easily so that you can put the harness on simply without lifting your legs. A handy feature for sure. I like that it also has a rear gear loop. I use this to rack all my non-climbing pieces~ so spare cord~ rescue pulleys~ prussiks~ and the anchor building material.    But I do have a few gripes. The new AR harnesses have solved my first one which is that the dice clipper slots were too loose. However the new harnesses still have the slots too far forward on the harness~ just above your thigh. I find that screws racked there tend to snag on my pants and cause rips.    My second issue is something with all Arc'teryx harnesses. The gear loops dont work well with a full trad rack. The weight keeps the floppy loops tighter against the body~ and the angle of the plastic loops slides gear forward making it a challenge to remove individual pieces at they are being weighed down by all the pieces behind it. For ice and stuff where I am carrying an alpine rack this doesn't make much of a difference~ but for any proper ttad climb I leave his fellow home.    Lastly~ I am a very skinny guy. Moving~ and climbing I generally find this harness comfortable. Hanging in it though is a pain. Hanging belays are the worst. I actually got scars from one very long day out. The theory that the surface area means less pressure in any one spot works~ if you are wider hipped. If you have narrow protruding boney hips~ then all the pressure sits on the protrusion.    Someone at Arc'teryx propagates this false idea. It's in all their packs too. I've talked to reps about it. Many of my customers will not buy Arc'teryx for exactly this reason. 
1055,mammut,focus,4.0,   Overall a great harness~ but when it's not on your body the legs loops get tangled easily and it can be a pain to untangle them.
1056,mammut,focus,5.0,   My Misty Mountain harness broke in less than a year (the quick disconnect on the left leg loop). Fortunately~ I bought it at REI~ and they exchanged it (it was still like new) for the Focus. It is a very well-built harness for the money. It looks as if this will give me years of service. I am a bigger guy~ and it still looks as if this harness will work for me.   Most of my climbing is at the REI wall~ but I do some (1-2 times a year) outdoor climbing.   Very good value harness!
1057,mammut,focus,5.0,   Bought in Fall 2006 to replace my old Petzl Dionysis Harness and I've been very happy. It's a hard act to follow the more expensive and widely popular Dionysis and the Focus pulled it off with an amazing price tag and comfort. It is quick & easy to put on except hooking the buttstraps~ after the harness was on~ took some getting used to. One thing that I didn't realized until this weekend when I wore the harness over winter layers for ice climbing was the waist actually fits smaller than normal for the size. The leg loops fit accurately but the waist in the medium size fits like a small size. I realized that the waist tips should actually overlap from where they meet under the side-buckle all the way across the front above the belay loop area. When this happens the harness sits better on the wearer and gear loops on the waist belt align correctly with your hips. Previously~ I was climbing sport and top rope with less clothing on and had little use for the gear loops so I didn't notice the harness belt was small on me & lopsided.    It is not a critical issue~ but I prefer to have my gear loops lined up symmetrically and I noticed that sizing up correctly will make the Focus contour your body better.    Even though the Focus is a great all around Harness the amazing contour technology that MAMMUT uses has also got me interested in buying the Mirage harness~ a lighter version of the Focus~ for Alpine ascents and Sport.   I definately recommend this harness~ but also recommend trying it on before you buy.
1058,mammut,focus,5.0,   This is a GREAT harness. Really well made and has a lot of features that you don't find on other harnesses in this price range. Plenty of padding~ all stitches are double reinforced. Very comfortable. Nice color! An excellent harness.
1059,mammut,focus,5.0,   My old Misty Mountain harness got stolen so I went to REI and got this one. Besides looking sweet~ it works really well. It is very adjustable and durable. I do mostly toprope climbing with some lead~ but this harness does its job really well and for a great price. Oh yeah~ and did I say it looks awesome.
1060,mammut,focus,5.0,   Purchased in the fall of 2005 used for lead climbing and some toproping just to break it in for its intended use as my primary ice climbing harness. Fit comfortably out of the box~ holds gear very well~ and shows no sign of wear~ well constructed~ top notch! Now that spring has arrived and I'm climbing rock again I still find myself packing this harness and leaving my much more expensive other brand in the closet. I love it so much I bought one for my girlfriend~ she loves it too!
1061,black-diamond,blizzard,5.0,   I am currently on my third Blizzard~ having used them for about 10 years on mostly glacier and ice climbs~ but a few rock climbs as well. Recently~ I used the current version on Mt Vinson. I find it to be very comfortable~ even when hauling a sled and carrying a full expedition pack. Several times~ at the end of the day~ I found myself still wearing it long after taking the pack off and setting up the tent (my companions asked why I was still wearing it on a couple of occasions).    It works well on climbs where you do the first few days of approach at lower~ warmer altitudes with less clothing~ followed by days at higher and colder altitudes~ perhaps in storm~ when you have more layers on~ thanks to a wide range of adjustment. For glacier travel~ the gear loops are fine. For ice climbing~ they are adequate most of the time on easier climbs~ but for more challenging climbs and for trad rock~ gear slings are needed (true with my big wall harness as well).
1062,black-diamond,blizzard,4.5,   This is a great harness for ice~ and I would echo all of the positive things said in the previous two reviews.   There is one detail that I found could be improved~ and that is the layout of the ice clipper slots. They are situated in a way that they pretty much overlap the gear loops. If you rack a few screws on a clipper~ it's hard to use the gear loop for racking your other necessities. I tried this both with the loops under the clipper~ as well as with the loop running through the clipper and both ways had their limitations.     The slots are so close together that it's not practical to put two clippers directly side by side once they are full of screws. This means that on longer ice climbs where you might want to have more than one clipper of (4-5) screws per side~ you have to space them out and you lose usage of your other gear loop in the mix.   The number and position of the slots are not universal.  There are less slots up front on the right side~ the side where I would like to carry extra screws because it's my favourite placement hand... Bummer.   I would have preferred having the same layout on both the left and right side of the harness~ and maybe some extra slots between/behind/in front of the gear loops allowing the option of clippers being used without interfering with the loops.    The actual clippers work great. They are easy to clip and un-clip in all conditions. The harness is comfortable~ fully adjustable~ and tough. It is easy to walk in even on long snow routes at altitude. Would I buy this again?  Definitely!
1063,black-diamond,blizzard,5.0,   The best harness I have ever used. It works equally well on rock and snow. I have worn it on all kinds of climbs~ and it is always comfortable. It is fairly lightweight~ for its features. I have found the gear loops to work well~ but you need a sling to rack some gear if your climb is a long~ sustained trad route. It comes with a clipper~ for ice screws~ which is a nice feature~ and it has slots for 7 for clippers. An awesome harness~ well worth its retail price of $80~ but you can usually find it on sale somewhere. I would check www.mountaingear.com
1064,black-diamond,focus-al,3.5,   Good all around   Pros   Simple~ comfortable and adjustable all around harness. I used it from sport to alpine climbing~ from summer to winter.   I like the way gear loops are designed: easy to clip or unclip due to their upside down position.   I have used it for 4 years now and still use it.
1065,black-diamond,focus-al,4.0,   It's adjustable; that's nice. It's padded; hooray for me.   I have big legs so this thing digs into me when I'm not suited up for winter climbing. I don't plan on using it when the summer roles around again; I only used it last summer a few times. For a summer harness~ I'll look for wider leg loops or loops that are padded thicker.   For winter climbing~ this thing is very good. It adjusts easily and is easy to put on. The gear loops return up when not loaded and are easy to clip onto. I've got no problems with it really besides the fit in the legs.
1066,black-diamond,focus-al,4.0,   Good harness~ taken a lot of falls and a 20 foot whiper. It's a great harness~ would not sport climb without it.
1067,black-diamond,half-dome,4.5,"   Another classic helmet. Great for the price.   Pros   Cons   ""Promise me Dad~ that you won't get me a helmet like yours or my brother's.""   She mostly meant that she didn't want an orange or red helmet but to be sure I ran the Half Dome by her first and after approval~ placed the order.   This is the third helmet I have bought and~ after two seasons of sport climbing and easy scrambling~ we don't regret it.   Besides the Camp Rock Star~ this is probably the most common helmet I see climbing. Since my oldest wanted a helmet that looked more modern~ adjusted to accommodate her pony tail~ and the price was right we gave it a go.   If all we ever did was sport climb in nice weather the adjustable suspension of this lid would be overkill.  However we also get into the mountains enough to need a few more features. For my daughter~ who never wears her hair the same way twice and is just as likely to wear a beanie as not~ easy adjustments are a must.  This lid has the ratcheting knob like most helmets designed this century and it makes adjustments a cinch. She also likes the color. The vents are bigger on the new model but she likes the clips for a headlamp which come in handy on alpine starts.    The only issue~ and it shows up in the pic below~ is that the helmet has a lot of extra space in the back.  This may be because my daughter has it sized down for her head but it makes it bigger than it needs to and she dislikes the bulk. ""It kinda makes my head look big"" I think were her words. Maybe the M/L wasn't the best pick.   The one we bought was on clearance and BD changed the style the year after we bought ours but I suspect that some of these versions are still around.   You see in the pic below that it also hugs her forehead so she has good visibility while she climbs which is a requirement for a climbing helmet.   Luckily~ we haven't given this helmet the ultimate test; I haven't dropped any rocks on her~ yet. Girls frown on that sort of thing~ but it's rated for climbing so I know it will provide a certain degree of protection from reasonable damage~ should the need arise.   A good deal for the price.      On Kaleetan Peak~ getting ready to summit."
1068,black-diamond,half-dome,5.0,   Lightweight helmet with an awesome fit.   Pros   Cons   I have a larger head and ordered the M/L Half Dome and couldn't be happier with it. The fit is perfect. The dial on the back truly gives me a custom-feeling fit that isn't too tight but is very form fitting. The chin strap and buckles are placed just right so that nothing rubs uncomfortably on my face~ jaw~ chin~ etc.   I can't guarantee this helmet would work equally well for every user~ but wearing this makes me feel like I got a custom-fitted brain bucket for an off-the-rack price.
1069,black-diamond,half-dome,4.5,   I have used this a dozen times rock climbing over the past 2 months. It is really lightweight and easily adjustable. I use it while lead climbing as well as belaying. Winter hats fit under it well and it can quickly be adjusted between climbers.    It's not a suspension helmet so I don't know how well it protects you from falling objects. However~ if you're looking for a lightweight~ versatile helmet~ this is it.
1070,black-diamond,half-dome,4.5,   I like this helmet because it is light and unobtrusive: you forget you're wearing it (mine is 2-3 years old). The classic design has good coverage for temples and back of the head. The slots hold a headlamp well. At first I didn't like the velcro adjustment at the back of the head~ but now that I'm used to it and have it fitted~ it's much better than the ratchet type and foam screws on some Petzls etc. Overall a great product! 
1071,black-diamond,half-dome,4.0,   This is a great low cost lightweight climbing helmet. Good if you casually use a helmet. There are better (Petzl) helmets~ but you can't beat the price!
1072,black-diamond,half-dome,4.5,   Light~ comfortable~ good value. Great light and packable helmet for general climbing~   Pros   I like this helmet for its simplicity and functionality. It's lighter than stated. I weighed mine using a high quality digital scale~ tarred and calibrated~ and it was 340 gm.   The adjustment dial and buckle work with ease and can be operated with gloves on. The headlamp strap holders are also simple and effective. It vents well and is quite comfortable~ even on my shaved head. Just the right amount of padding in the right places.    Very good buy.
1073,black-diamond,half-dome,4.0,   Very comfortable and durable helmet. Great quality for use on rock and ice.    Pros   I've used this helmet on rock and ice~ and it has definitely help up well and done its job. While looking at helmet options~ I had debated the options for weights~ but I went with this durable helmet over other lightweight options.  This helmet isn't much heavier~ but I prefer the extra protection the Half Dome provides.   The sizing has been easy to adjust~ and it feels very comfortable. I have the blue color~ and it looks great.
1074,mammut,skywalker-2,4.0,   When you need a helmet this is one of many good options   Pros   Cons   This is my second climbing helmet. I wanted a better fit and suspension system and I got it.      On the summit of Mt. Rainier      On the summit of Mt. Hood      Icicle Ridge      Crevasse rescue class~ with a TS cap of course      Kaleetan Peak   All helmets are tested to the same standard~ so what I like about this one is the adjustability: it fits me in the summer~ and in winter with a beanie underneath~ and I like the suspension system. It is easy to adjust when I switch from summer to winter mode and stays where I want it on my head.    I got this helmet in orange for visibility on the snow.   Cons: The shell feels kinda brittle. I had a Rock Star helmet and it felt like it could take a hit and rebound~ I am afraid that this one will chip or shatter when it takes its first good hit. 
1075,mammut,skywalker-2,5.0,   I just got mine. It handled the rocks on the Bells well and after 12 hours it still didn't bother me.  Straps comfortable vented well. It's a good helmet~ go for it.
1076,petzl,sirocco,5.0,   The lightweight~ and seemingly styrofoam structure of this helmet make it intimidating~ but after hard use it has turned out to be an excellent helmet.   Pros   Cons   Finally fed up with my old Lucky brand helmet from the '90s I decided to shop for a new one.   I decided I wanted lightweight~ and something much more comfortable then my current helmet. So my choices came down to the Petzl Meteor~ Black Diamond Vapour~ and the Petzl Sirocco.    The Meteor didn't fit me~ so that went out. Originally I had thrown out the idea of the Sirocco as it looked too ridiculous. The bright orange bellend shape. No thanks!   The BD Vapour looks excellent! Very slick cool shape. It felt good~ was lightweight and comfortable. But all this still made the price unsettling. If it took a hit it would have to be replaced. On a multi-day trip this could cause problems. A broken helmet would cancel plans. Naturally injuries sustained from a helmet shattering hit would probably cancel plans as well~ but I didn't want to be left vulnerable~ or empty pocketed by the incident. So I can back to the Sirocco.   And now that I have it I couldn't be more pleased. I've come to terms with the style (seeing badasses like Ueli Steck wear it has helped). But the helmet is excellent at 165 grams you don't notice it. It's just no extra weight. And on your head you quickly forget it's there. I was scrambling the other day and when I braked for lunch at the summit~ I ate~ lay down~ and 20 minutes later remembered I was wearing it when I went to put a toque on due to my head getting cold in the wind.    All in all it's excellent. The polypropylene structure has repelled some hits already~ though nothing major. One issue I have encountered is scrapping of the helmet across rocks leaves marks~ and small dents in the foam. It's nothing that compromises the strength of the helmet~ but it could add up. A plastic covering would have been nice~ and altered the horrid fluorescent orange.    But it's the best helmet currently on the market hands down. It's more durable then any other~ and since it is a dynamic construction it takes damage well. Definitely a good buy.   
1077,camp,rock-star,3.5,   I'd love it way more if it were more adjustable   Pros   Cons   This helmet has a killer shell~ it's cheap~ but it is super tight on my melon.   I bought mine online. This was my first helmet and I wanted something simple. I see a lot of these helmets on climbers~ especially people who rent their gear~ leading me to think they are pretty durable.  This helmet however~ was a little too simple. The size large looked like a swim cap on my size 7-3/8 head. It hurt my forehead it was so tight. The straps didn't do much to adjust the position on my head either.   It's a take-it-or-leave-it affair: either it fits or it doesn't. So I gave it to my 10-year-old son and he loves it and hasn't found a way to destroy it yet~ which says a lot.    We do mostly sport climbs and we occasionally head into the mountains for scrambles where loose rock is a real problem.   The closed cell foam inside is definitely durable and the shell feels like hard Tupperware and can definitely take a hit and keep on going.  I never though it had been much tested by falling rock until I examined it after our last trip and noticed several small nicks from marble and golf ball sized rocks that might have stung~ were it not for the helmet.    This workhorse skid lid has NO bells or whistles but if it fits you it might just last a lifetime.   My other~ more modern~ helmet is much lighter and has more adjustable suspension and newer helmets are lighter still.  However if you need inexpensive coverage that allows really good visibility consider this one.       On the summit with his No big deal pose.  The time stamp isn't correct.  I think it was more like 10:41 AM than PM.      A perfect fit for a pre-teen boy
1078,petzl,ecrin-roc,5.0,   I use this helmet for caving and I really like it.  It is very adjustable and just the straps cradle your head~ not thick foam. It is easy to clean. I like that it is quite comfortable.    Pros   Cons   I use this helmet for caving and I really like it. When I heard that they were no longer being produced~ I got one at an auction~ but I'm still using my original one. It is very adjustable and I like that it doesn't have foam to make my head warmer~ just the straps cradle your head.   It is the helmet I am more likely to lend because it is easy to clean and the cushioned band that goes around your forehead is closed cell foam~ so any sweat or grime can be easily cleaned. I like that it is quite comfortable. 
1079,petzl,ecrin-roc,5.0,   It is one of the best helmets for caving~ very strong and durable. All caving clubs in Slovenia use it. It is a slightly heavier than new Petzl models of helmets.   I recommend. =)   Pros   Cons   I use it for cave exploring and climbing and when I go in mountains.   I have on helmet the fixed lamp.   I have that helmet a few years and it looks like it will be forever.
1080,petzl,ecrin-roc,5.0,"   It's the ""Best"" helmet. I have used it extensively from rock climbing to winter mountaineering.    Absolutely rock solid~ heavier than the more contemporary models~ but do not forget almost all of them have been designed by taking this particular helmet into consideration. Adjustable to any head. Plastic patches are available if you wanna restrict the air flow or stop the rain through the air vents on either side of the helmet.   Look no other~ this has been on the market for I do not know how many years~ proved its usefulness to the extremes.       "
1081,petzl,ecrin-roc,5.0,   I use this helmet for caving~ as does my daughter. Major advantages include the easily adjusted straps and headband~ the clips for holding a headlamp on the helmet~ and the air vents.    Disadvantages--none that I know of~ except that a headlamp can be pulled out of the clips by a passing rock while crawling. I have not used this helmet for rock climbing.
1082,petzl,elios,5.0,   Lightweight~ plenty of ventilation~ easy to adjust.      What's not to like?   Pros   Cons   I wore this helmet just once last year. Didn't really needed it~ decided to take it for a test drive~ just to get the feel of it.   My head circumference is 55.5cm so I could marginally fit in Size 1 (48-56cm). If I was going to wear a beanie...no way. That's why I chose Size 2 (53-61cm) with room to spare.It features a 5-step side ventilation system and a fixed one in the back. Couldn't get any better than this.The headlight clips seem robust but they're somehow tight for the headband of my Nitecore HC50 and had some difficulty to place it correctly. Apart from that it's all good.The adjustment system in the back becomes intuitive once you wear the helmet. I did the adjustment wearing a pair of Mechanix gloves (that easy).The foam in front does the job as far as wicking sweat is concerned. My forehead was irritated when I removed the helmet. Hmm...maybe I over-tied it~ don't know.Adjusting the straps is also very easy with this clip system although I'm not sure if it's going to last for long. Being a motorcyclist for decades I put my faith in double buckle rather than any other mechanism.   Can't say anything about maintaining integrity after a rock or a chunk of ice falls on it and hope I never will.   Overall I like this helmet. I read a lot of reviews before buying it and everybody seems happy with it. Add another one to this list! :)
1083,petzl,elios,3.5,"   This is a lightweight~ well ventilated helmet for your head. Best used while rock and ice climbing. The headband has a quick tightening knob on the back for size adjustment. It has headlamp clamps that you don't notice until you need them. The chin strap is easy to connect. Every connection point on the straps has teeth~ so it is time consuming to adjust~ but once you get it adjusted it doesn't move. There is no sun visor lip. The front comes right down to your eyebrows.    Pros   Cons   This is a lightweight~ well ventilated helmet for your head. Best used while rock and ice climbing. This is a unisex design but does not have a pony tail cutout on the back like some helmets do. There are two sizes available.   Over all~ this helmet does its job well.   The strong points are the light weight and ventilation of the helmet.   The drawbacks are the small adjustment range and the difficulty in adjusting the chin strap.   The headband has a quick tightening knob on the back for size adjustment. You can wear a thin beenie or hat with this helmet by just rotating the adjustment knob a few clicks. When you remove the beenie~ just a couple of clicks of the quick adjustment knob~ and you have it adjusted snug again. Nice~ quick and secure.   The chin strap buckle is nice and easy to snap~ you can do it once handed. It is easy to adjust the tightness. It also doesn't move once you get it set. I have a slightly ""longer"" or ""taller"" head than normal. For me~ I wished I could lower the Y junction on each slide of the chip strap to clear my ear lobes~ but this is not possible with this strap system. You can only adjust the chin strap angle forward or backward. To do so~ you have to remove the helmet and pry the strap out of each connection point (every connection point has teeth) to feed or take up slack to adjust the chin strap angle. It's very time consuming~ but you should only have to do it but once~ if any. Once you get it adjusted~ it doesn't move or slip.   The helmet has headlamp clamps that you don't notice until you need them. I've never caught them on any gear or rock feature. They are out of the way and do not cause any problems. The headlamp strap securely slides under the clamps and stays put.   There is no sun visor lip or ""bill"" on the front edge. The front edge comes straight down to your eye brows with just a slight lip. This allows you to squeeze into holes while caving and to get real close to the rock while climbing. A few times I've been in the rain and wished it had a bigger lip to keep the water drips out of my face.   This helmet fits very close to your forehead but much higher on the top of your head where the padding is. This causes you to have a slightly alien look. But I'd rather look weird and have the protection than not have any protection."
1084,petzl,elios,5.0,   Great Helmet. I use it for alpine and rock climbing. Most of the time I don't even know that I have it on~ it is that comfortable. Head lamp fits perfect on the clips. Wheel ratchet for the fit is easy to use even with gloves on.    Rock Climbing:       Pros- Light~ comfortable~ vents great in summer~ and adjustable.   Alpine Climbing:      Pros-Light~ the part that ratchets down folds into the helmet for easy packing~ and adjustable to what is on your noodle.   Cons- none   I would buy this helmet again!
1085,grivel,salamander,4.5,   A very comfortable helmet that has multiple sizes available. A great helmet for ice climbing~ rock climbing~ and mountaineering. Comes in multiple colors.   Pros   Cons   This is a great helmet. I own several different climbing helmets and this one has by far become my favorite across all climbing sports.   I have a large head and the multiple sizes allow me to get a good fit. Some one-size-fits all helmets are tough for me to fit.   One of the most important features I have found is the improved side protection around the ears. This prevents the helmet getting pushed to the side when I lean my head against the rock on tougher climbs.    It is also a great mountaineering helmet as it doesn't bounce around much while hiking.   It does get a bit hot in the sun. but is not much worse than any other helmet I own.
1086,grivel,salamander,1.0,   I used the helmet less then a dozen times before the suspension in the helmet broke in the back.    I don't recommend buying from Grivel in North America anymore. I took it back to the shop so they could get it warrantied~ but there is no longer a distributor in North America so you cannot get it warrantied without sending it to France.
1087,grivel,salamander,4.0,"   I've been in the market for a climbing helmet for quite some time. My problem is that I have a small melon. Kid's size even! I've tried a variety of small helmets.  Some fit OK but were ""kid colored"" or decorated with ""cool"" or ""rad"" graphics. Some adult helmets~ like the Petzl Elios~ are available in a small size too~ but the fit just wasn't right. The regular size (size 2) was too large~ and the small (size 1) looked like I had a 2 lb. margarine tub on my head! Not enough coverage.   I found the Grivel Salamander (size small) online and decided to give it a try.     Pros: This helmet fits great. It's really light and offers full coverage of the top and back of my head without limiting mobility of~ or rubbing~ my neck.  Even though I got the small~ there are still a number clicks left in the adjustment band allowing me to wear a helmet liner~ or even a wool cap. The suspension system is a lot more comfortable than the Petzl Elios~ and it's less complicated too. There is a clear or smoke colored visor available for this helmet to protect your eyes from ice~ dust and small debris while on belay.   Cons: The headlamp retention system could use some beefing up - front and rear elastic cords only~ no side clips. Adequate~ but minimal. The decals that come on the Salamander are a bit much~ but they came off easily and cleanly   This helmet is not currently available at REI as this site states. I got mine at http://www.mountaingear.com/pages/product/product.asp/imanf/Grivel/idesc/Salamander+Helmet/Store/MG/item/210189/N/0   More info at www.grivel.com"
1088,petzl,meteor-iii,5.0,   This helmet is awesome. Light~ comfortable~ and the venting works great.   It may not last as long as the hard shell ones~ but it is worth it. This helmet stays put~ which in my opinion makes it even safer than the some hard shell ones that don't stay in place. It is worth the money.
1089,petzl,meteor-iii,5.0,   Great helmet. I can wear it with or without hats or dreads very comfortably. It vents great in the summer and you forget that it is on head. I have taken several small falls and knocked my noggin with this helmet and it is still in good shape.
1090,petzl,meteor-iii,5.0,   I have not tried other helmets~ but have looked over others~ and this one is so lightweight~ you hardly even notice it's on~ which is a good thing when using a helmet.
1091,petzl,meteor-iii,3.0,   Any helmet is better than no helmet. Remember though~ the best helmet is the one that you never have to test.      This one is good enough but the less expensive ones work too.   Fit is more important than style. Why? Glad you asked. BECAUSE if it doesn't fit it may not work correctly~ and now~ what's style gonna do for you if your forehead is under your chin?
1092,mammut,multipitch-chalk-bag,5.0,   Great for multi-pitch climbing~ allows me to carry a headlamp~ emergency blanket~ and a couple snack bars.   Pros   Cons   This is a great chalk bag for multipitch climbers that don't want to carry a backpack. There is enough space in the back pouch for a headlamp~ 2-3 snack bars~ and an emergency blanket. Additionally~ there is a bungee cord on the bottom that allows you to strap on a light shirt or packable windbreaker. Clip a water bottle to your harness~ and you're all set to go fast and light without a backpack.   The chalk bag part of it works as expected~ although if you overfill the other pockets~ it gets a little tough getting your hand in.   My only minor complaint is that the sling meant to attach it to your harness is a little thin~ so the chalkbag can spin a little bit~ especially if your harness is loaded up with gear~ so sometimes the chalk isn't where you expect it to be when you reach for it.   Experience   I've used this chalk bag when multi-pitch climbing for a couple years. I've probably used it on a few dozen separate occasions.
1093,la-sportiva,laspo-chalk-bag,5.0,   This climber’s essential has all of the necessary features of a chalk bag~ at a great price point. This chalk bag works well for any type of indoor or outdoor climber~ whether bouldering at the gym~ or multi-pitch days on a big wall.   Pros   Cons   When it comes to knowing a product will perform flawlessly~ people reach out to a small handful of brands. La Sportiva is certainly one of these elite companies~ handcrafting products in northern Italy for outdoor enthusiasts since 1929. Although footwear for climbing and skiing is their expertise~ they have excelled in the textile industry as well. A product like a chalk bag may well be a simple piece of climbing gear~ but finding that piece of gear~ relying on it to ALWAYS work~ and never having to think about said gear is not so simple.       Specifications:   The LaSpo chalk bag is a typical easy to use tool for the climber. Once it is opened up and snapped onto one’s waist~ there’s quite simply nothing else to need to think about. Well~ there is that thing about making sure chalk is in the bag...   The Laspo Chalk Bag holds enough volume for all day climbing   No chalk spills occur with the drawstring   La Sportiva excels when it comes to attention to detail   Some argue that an external harness loop should be included on all chalk bags~ but the argument that the bag is then too far under the harness~ making it more difficult to reach. Although the bag could in theory be problematic to use in an inverted position~ no concern was evident in attempts to do so during testing.    The bag is made of a durable ripstop nylon~ which keeps the contents dry inside~ and protected from constant abrasion...indoors and out.    The La Sportiva Laspo Chalk Bag has been tested during the summer and early autumn of 2018 indoors. A combination of bouldering~ top rope~ and lead climbing has been the upper limits of the tester’s capability; hopefully a more dry year will allow for future outdoor testing.    Many thanks to the people at La Sportiva for the opportunity to to test the Laspo Chalk Bag for the Trailspace Gear Review Corps.      Experience   The product tester has been climbing on a beginner to intermediate level for approximately three years. Several other climbing chalk bags have been used over the years. This product has been tested in several indoor climbing gyms during summer-autumn of 2018. Types of climbing during testing: bouldering~ top rope~ sport lead. 
1094,black-diamond,forearm-trainer,2.0,"   Worked well until it broke.   Pros   Cons   So pretty much every spring-type grip exerciser I have tried is way too flimsy. I have heard of strong ones but I thought that since this one is made by a company who makes climbing equipment~ it should be pretty good.   A little about me; I climb sport routes in the 5.10 range about once per week at the local crag. I figured that stronger hands would do a better job of holding my clydesdale frame on the rock.    When it arrived it smelt strongly of solvent but since it IS made of rubber I didn't think of the odor as too out of the ordinary. I have read reviews of this item by people who acted like the smell was so bad that being in the same room with it would surely shorten their life. I can only guess that these people either had an especially smelly one or that they are of that obnoxious variety of human who tends to have diva moments about minor things~ their tirades usually begin with~ ""Oh my gaaaaawwwd!""    Anyway~ it is relatively easy to crush this ring with one hand. However with this one I tried different ways to close it such as only using two or three fingers to close it. With creativity I found a couple good workouts that I coule use it for while I drove to and from work. There is no manual included so you will have to figre out how to use it yourself. I especially liked closing it quickly forty or so times then holding it closed for as long as possible. I felt a pump very similar to what I feel on a crimpy climb.    So then one day it broke. I squeezed it on my way home from work after owning it for two short momths and it tore and became a C rather than an O like it had been. I contacted the retailer I ordered it from and they have promised me a new one soon~ free of charge. The nice lady said it was too inexpensive to ship it back so I should get a new one soon. That was Friday~ it arrived the next Monday!   Like I said it was OK~ but a stronger ring would be better."
1095,black-diamond,forearm-trainer,5.0,   Simple and extremely effective!   Pros   Cons   This simple rubber ring has done more for my forearm strength in one use than weeks of doing 50 full forearm curls. They wear you out very quickly but you can allow some time to recover and then begin again. I personally use it while sitting around the house until I just can't anymore. This is a no maintenance trainer that I regret not buying months ago.
1096,mammut,basic-chalk-bag,3.5,   The name says it all. A basic~ bare bones chalk bag. This is one of the cheapest chalk bags you can get. Good for beginners climbing indoors.   Pros   Cons   As the name implies~ it's basic. The outside material is a lightweight nylon (Taffeta 260T) that feels like one of those ultra lightweight running jackets. It's soft~ but it feels sort of durable. If you're climbing indoors~ this will suffice~ but if you're outside~ you might need something stronger.    The black fabric easily collects chalk and has faded to a different shade of black (it's black~ but not the original black). There is also a small brush holder.       This bag has two suspension points. The first one is on the rim of the bag. When you get the bag there is a nylon cord belt attached to it (This is the most basic model). The next suspension point is on the back of the bag. Two large loops that can secure a traditional nylon belt found on most bags.   The belt they give you is okay. What I like is that it's minimal and doesn't get in the way and is easy to adjust. The downfall is putting it on~ which involves opening it as wide as you can and stepping into it.   The closure system is pretty simple and works well. It's tight and there isn't a large poof of chalk followed by it when you drop it. The bag can hold a decent amount of chalk like most bags. When fully opened putting your hands inside is easy. The interior is lined with fleece and feels pretty good (not cheap) and it retains the chalk well.   Overall this is a good bag for climbing. It's a simple~ bare bones bag with no fluff or anything fancy.
1097,crawldaddies,knee-pads,5.0,"   Crawldaddies Knee Pads are some of the best cottage industry caving gear on the market. Made by a caver~ for cavers~ CD Knee Pads are rugged~ comfortable~ and worth every penny. I mistakenly purchased the short knee pads~ and while I wish I had bought the longer version to better protect my shins~ I have been entirely satisfied with the quality and durability of the short pads.   Pros   Cons   For far too many years~ I relied on standard volleyball knee pads for my caving adventures. While these cheap pads spare my knees from bruises~ they are difficult to get on over a pair of jeans~ and they only last a few trips underground. Additionally~ the back of my knees ache after several hours of walking~ crawling~ and squeezing through passages.   My kids and me in sucky volleyball knee pads.   About a year ago~ I purchased Crawldaddies Knee Pads (http://crawldaddies.com/index.html) at the Fall Cave-In on Look Out Mountain~ Georgia. They can be purchased on line at Inner Mountain Outfitters.   One of Crawldaddie's competitors~ ""Dirty Dave~"" told me the single best way to extend the life of my knee pads by a full year was to cover them with a thin coating of E6000 Multipurpose Adhesive. Given that I intended to use these they same day I bought them~ I wish they were pre-treated. But this “con” is a minor one.   In my rush to get caving that afternoon~ I stupidly purchased the “short” knee pads. These are still much longer than traditional volleyball pads~ but as I discovered at the top of Mystery Falls Cave~ they do not cover the shins as I hoped they would.   Long pads would have been a shin saver. Oh well.   Fit and Comfort:   The padded portion measures a full 12"" long~ completely covering the knee from the top to down below the dreaded “funny bone.” (Note~ in the picture below the pad on the right has just been treated with E6000.)   On the back of the pad are two sections of neoprene. The gap between the two sections prevents jeans from rubbing directly behind the knee~ reducing the dreaded chaffing that occurs there with regular volleyball pads. Two Velcro straps secure the neoprene to hold each section in place.   A third Velcro strap is at the top of the pad~ high above the knee and around the lower thigh. This is the primary strap that keeps the pad from slipping down the leg as a caver crawls through tight passages (another common problem with cheap knee pads). It also keeps rocks and grit from getting in between the pad and the leg. This strap does not require the neoprene cushion~ as it is not a pressure point~ like the lower straps surrounding the knee.   Altogether~ the neoprene and straps fit comfortably and prevent the pad from moving while in use. They also make it much easier to slip the pads over jeans and coveralls.      Quality and Durability   I have found these pads to be extremely well made. The stitching is flawless. The materials are top notch. Even without the E6000 coating~ CD expect their pads to last the average caver 2-3 years. I don't cave nearly as much as I would like. So I plan on getting even more life out of them. Time will tell. [2017 update: After 2 years these knee pads are still going strong without showing much wear and tear!]      In the meantime~ I am putting them to the fullest of testing...   "
1098,black-diamond,chalk-bag,4.5,"   An easy to use chalk bag that has multiple ways to attach it to your belt loop or harness.    Pros   Cons   When I started climbing this was the first chalk bag I bought. The first thing I was drawn to were the various colors that Black Diamond offers in their bags. Who doesn't like a little style and personality on the mountain?   I personally attach a carabiner to the bag and then to a belt loop or to my harness. The only real drawback I have with this chalk bag is the small opening to allow your hand inside the bag. I am a smaller man~ only about 5'7"" and I am sure larger handed individuals would have much more difficulty than I had.    I am a big fan of Black Diamond and it has gone with me on every climbing trip and I have loaned it to many friends that have gotten great use out of this economical chalk bag. "
