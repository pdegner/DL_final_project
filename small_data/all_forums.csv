0,Katabatic quilts and down shift,1,0, Have a hammock gear quilt right now.  I really like it but am annoyed with the continous baffles and having to move the down each night before I go to bed.  The down always seems to end up in the end of the baffles and it's a fair bit of work to get it back on top where I want it.   I like the pad attachment system that Katabatic uses and was thinking of upgrading but curious if the down will do a better job staying put?   ,Jan 2012,Jul 5 2020,1
1,Katabatic quilts and down shift,1,1, Do you roll or stuff the quilt when not in use? I have the HG Incubator and haven't had this problem. Gear with filled insulation like this should be stuffed instead of rolled to avoid pushing the insulation down to the ends I believe. Best of luck with your hang~,Mar 2020,Jul 5 2020,0
2,Katabatic quilts and down shift,1,2, I stuff it and every night the down ends up at the ends of the baffles on the sides of the bag and has to be pushed back. It stays put if I spend 2 nights in the same place but there’s something about how I’m stuffing it I guess I have like 5 other bags including another HG bad and don’t have problems with any others. ,Jan 2012,Jul 6 2020,0
3,Katabatic quilts and down shift,1,3, I've had one of the Katabatic 20 degree quilt for the last 6 years. No issues like you're describing with down bunching up. I use the tiny stuff sack it came with backpacking and there are no problems~ but for car camping I stuff it loosely in a reusable grocery bag just in case it prolongs the quilt's life. One of my favorite pieces of gear!,Jun 2016,Jul 6 2020,0
4,Adidas owning 5.10,1,0, I know this is kind of old news~ but what is the general opinion of 5.10 shoes now that Adidas owns the brand? Specifically~ the new dragon lace ups and the rubber. Is stealth rubber still being used and is it still as sticky as before? ,Jun 2017,Nov 21 2019,0
5,Adidas owning 5.10,1,1, Adidas has owned 5.10 since 2011~ longer than most have been climbing.,Aug 2019,Nov 21 2019,22
6,Adidas owning 5.10,1,2, I think overwhelmingly~ the change has hurt the brand. Shoes that people like are discontinued. Sizes can vary between manufacturing runs. New shoe designs underwhelming and under-performing compared to previously designed shoes. People are not sure about the rubber~ if its changed or not.  The one big positive is they firesale them quite frequently. ,Jul 2017,Nov 21 2019,7
7,Adidas owning 5.10,1,3, Meh. That may have been when there was a transaction but the major changes~ like closing the American production facilities and moving production to Asia started happening more recently. ,Jan 2017,Nov 21 2019,12
8,Adidas owning 5.10,1,4," I dunno about the rubber~ but I have some moccs and while I like the fit they are already fraying in the ""leather"" around the edge after about 15-20 climbing days.",Nov 2018,Nov 21 2019,0
9,Adidas owning 5.10,1,5, I wore guide tennis before and after Adidas took over~ and have noticed a huge decline in quality since the takeover. Whatever Adidas uses to glue the rubber to the bottom of the shoe started peeling off almost immediately~ and pretty soon the entire front end of the rubber becomes unglued and hangs there like a reverse flip-flop. This happened to two pairs in a row. After that~ I switched to Sportiva approach shoes~ which I've been happy with. ,Oct 2008,Nov 21 2019,7
10,Adidas owning 5.10,1,6, Big issue with sizing changes and durability occurred when they moved production to Asia. They seem to quickly fall apart and wear under normal use now.,Sep 2019,Nov 21 2019,2
11,Adidas owning 5.10,1,7, same story here with approach shoes,Mar 2016,Nov 21 2019,4
12,Adidas owning 5.10,1,8, #fakenews,Oct 2019,Nov 21 2019,1
13,Adidas owning 5.10,1,9, Sizing from adidas is a huge issue - if I find a pair that fits me in a store~ maybe I'll buy them~ but maybe not~ because I'll never be able to get a second pair of the same shoe~ back to the starting line of finding a pair of shoes I like.  Certainly will never order another pair again~ as there's no telling what actual size will come in the mail~. That includes approach shoes.  It's worth remention that a bunch of five.ten employees went and started the company Unparallel recently. I had one pair until they were stolen~ and I was super impressed with the quality and the rubber. I'll buy those again.,Apr 2007,Nov 21 2019,4
14,Adidas owning 5.10,1,10, I never had the american made shoes~ but the Adidas 5.10 shoes I have tried have been less than impressive in terms of quality compared to the Italian brands. ,Oct 2016,Nov 21 2019,0
15,Adidas owning 5.10,1,11, My own previous snarkiness aside~ I’ve experienced and observed more Sportiva quality issues than any other brand. I haven’t bought a new pair of hiangles in a couple years~ but I’ve never had 5.10 issues myself.,Aug 2019,Nov 21 2019,4
16,Adidas owning 5.10,1,12, Yeah I would say of the major brands~ the biggest QC issues have been Evolv and La Sportiva.  TC Pro delams~ Miura toe blowouts in 2 months...they’re pretty infamous for it.  The Five Tens I’ve owned have all been top notch in construction.  Only owned one pair of Scarpas but they’ve impressed me~ even though they don’t fit my feet that great.,Jul 2014,Nov 21 2019,0
17,Adidas owning 5.10,1,13, Same here. I haven't been climbing long enough to have used 'American' 5.10~ but after being disappointed with the Adidas Pink Anasazi I bought the Unparallel UP Lace and I've been using them for maybe 6 months or so. I'll probably buy another pair soon too~ as my current ones are getting a bit too comfy to the detriment of performance.,Jul 2019,Nov 21 2019,1
18,Adidas owning 5.10,1,14, I’ve been using 5.10 since they started and during the transition to Adidas.  I recently bought a pair of Grandstones and have to say they are the best built pair of shoes I’ve ever bought from them~ very high quality build. And BTW~ they are still using C4 the same sticky rubber.  ,Apr 2012,Nov 22 2019,2
19,Adidas owning 5.10,1,15, I have some guide tennies from before and after the factory shut down (seemingly where the issues started~ not the change of ownership). The ones before the shut down are older~ more used and... in SIGNIFICANTLY better condition. The ones purchased almost a year later are already all but useless with the bottom rubber almost completely detached. I will say I talked to an adidas rep who said they tried pretty hard to change the C4 rubber (trying to make it more eco friendly) but could not do it. So supposedly it is the same rubber. ,Sep 2013,Nov 22 2019,3
20,Adidas owning 5.10,1,16, FWIW~ I love my 5.10 Quantum lace-ups and the Stealth rubber that they used. It lasted me about 6 months and I am now about to send them in to be resoled. However~ I have found that 5.10/Adidas is absolute dog shit when it comes to customer service. It has taken them 2-3 days to even ship shoes that I have bought through their super sale and~ even then~ shipping is slow (always more than a week from shipping date in my experience). Additionally~ I ordered a couple pairs of Team VXIs which just didn't fit my foot well and~ despite them having received the shoes~ I have not heard anything regarding my refund.  Bottom line: love the shoes~ not the customer service. Buy em from literally any retailer other than Adidas themselves. ,Jan 2019,Nov 22 2019,0
21,Adidas owning 5.10,1,17, I think any current 5.10 issues were also present before Adidas bought them~ sizing and quality included.  If anything they may have improved in some ways with the support of the larger company.  Haven't heard any current complaints regarding a drop in the rubber quality. For every 5.10 complaint I've heard regarding delaminating~ I've heard one for Sportiva as well.  ,Jan 2012,Nov 22 2019,2
22,Adidas owning 5.10,1,18, 5.10 quality was always inferior to the European shoe makers. It is the Dodge Charger of climbing shoe companies and always was. Adidas buying them was like Fiat buying Chrysler - SOS.,May 2015,Nov 22 2019,2
23,Adidas owning 5.10,1,19, Delam issues are not always the manufacturers fault.   Shoes get abused~ they get thrown in the back of a car and sit it the hot sun and bake.   They get wet from sweat and then thrown into the bottom of a pack and then 30lbs of gear gets loaded on top and then we wonder why my shoes are starting to delaminate.   Take care of you shoes.  It’s like to new climber who’s shoes are blown out in the toe after a month and they complain that it’s a manufacturer defect when it’s clearly poor footwork.   I’ve never had a pair of Five Ten climbing shoes delam and I’ve been using them since Five Ten started.  I have had one pair of Guide Tennies start to delam but that was quickly fixed with a bit of super glue gel.   ,Apr 2012,Nov 22 2019,3
24,Adidas owning 5.10,1,20, I'm old...53 to be exact~ and I have not had any issues with my multiple 5.10 shoes: Spires~ Pinks~ Coyotes and Gambits (and more that I can't remember). But they were all made in the USA and have all had many resoles.  The Coyotes are about done~ the inside liner is all but gone and the leather is wearing through from the inside. Fantastic smearing shoe IMO.  The highest quality shoe I've ever had is the Boreal Ballet Gold~ they are just a really well made shoe. Lots of stitching and rubber~ in the right places~ to make the shoes super durable.  I go through a lot of laces~ because these are crack shoes. I also own the Boreal Ninja~ which also are super well made.  La Sportiva is more hit and miss. My Cobras only took two resoles before they were toast. My Mythos on the other hand have been resoled at least four times~ maybe 5.  My Kaukulators were the same way....many many resoles before the leather ripped. My first pair was orange~ I remember that~ long gone~ but lasted a few seasons. Only pair of Scarpa I ever had was the Helix~ not that great a shoe IMO. I don't climb much severely overhanging stuff~ or pockets~ so I don't really have a need for a super aggressive shoe~ so maybe my choice of shoes just last longer than others.,Jul 2015,Nov 22 2019,1
25,Adidas owning 5.10,2,0, Strongly disagree.  I used to order 1-2 pairs of the same darn size of Ansazi Velcros  every year for years and years~ and got the same shoe every time~ from 2002ish? to 2012.  I could take them out of the box~ throw them in the pack~ and wear them 1st time at a cliff~ always the very same shoe.,Apr 2007,Nov 22 2019,1
26,Adidas owning 5.10,2,1, I started using 5.10 in 1996.  Before that I had a few pairs of Boreals (Vector/Laser/Ballet)~ Scarpas (Rockmaster)~ Asolos (Opera) and La Sportivas (Kendo/SuperX/Ballerina/Mythos).  In 5.10~ before Adidas took over~ I used the Razor (best shoe ever)~ VX~ UFO~ RockSox~ Moccs~ and Ansazi lace and Velcro. Since 2011~ I've had several pairs of Dragons~ various Anasazis~ as well as a couple pairs of Quantums~ HiAngles and Arrowheads.  Before 2012 or so~ I had absolutely no issues with sizing in 5.10~ and I could find them in a store and actually try them on.  Since about that time frame~ the sizing seems to be all over the place~ and since it seems like no store carries the brand any longer~ it is basically a complete lottery whether the pair I ordered will fit or not.  I have had size 7 fit perfectly~ but then I wasn't able to get an 8 on my feet at all~ and I have (somewhat) comfortably worn 5.10 anywhere from size 6.5 to 8.5.  This is really unfortunate~ and I have started to drift to Sportiva as result.  Though they don't fit quite as well~ the sizing is more consistent than 5.10~ and they have better rubber than Boreal. As for 5.10 quality issues~ I have had none outside of a pair of Anasazi Pinks literally splitting in apart at the heel after three days of use. Customer service was completely unresponsive when I tried to warranty them~ so that wasn't that great either.  I did have the same thing happen on a pair of VXs~ but that was after a resole~ and they were a super light weight shoe that 5.10 made for only 1 year in the late 90s.,Feb 2012,Nov 22 2019,0
27,Adidas owning 5.10,2,2, Second this comment.  Guide Tennis were my favorite and only approach shoe.  My last purchase (maybe 2.5 years ago) the sole came off within the first season.  Send them back~ got a new pair~ happened again.  I switched to Sportivas as well and have been very  happy!,Feb 2014,Nov 22 2019,0
28,Adidas owning 5.10,2,3, I know a few sponsored climbers and apparently a former rep who all feel that the rubber is not the same.  The new Adidas factory has only been producing shoes for about the past 9 months and not all retailers have the new stock. There is a very stark difference between the new and old Hiangle construction.  You can tell if you have the new ones as the toe hook rubber is thinner and inside the shoe there is a horizontal seam near the midsole. Also~ the label is different. I loved my old Five Tens so much that I stockpiled many of them. The Teams never changed nor did the old Dragons. The new Hiangles feel uber stiff and insensitive and the heel fits differently (better for me~ doesn't bag out). I loved that the Hiangle had some stiffness~ but you could still microadjust and pull with the toes. The newest ones I have feel a lot like an Instinct VS or Solution when new~ but both of those shoes break in quicker and better. I don't feel that the rubber is as sticky. The Aleon is a love/hate. Most people I know like the heel for its fit~ but not for heel hooking. The stretchiness of the upper means you have to really crank the velcro for it not to move during heel hooks~ but it won't pull off. The main issue is the toebox can be love/hate.  It is one of the only toeboxes that pushes the big toe inwards and it is almost diamond shaped rather than a talon like the Dragon or Solution and for some it just never gets comfortable. You can see my other posts about the Dragons~ but almost no sponsored climbers are wearing the shoe and very few normal people I have met seem to like it. While the build quality is higher~ the design isn't there. They feel more like an Evolv than a Five Ten. Let's be honest- no one ever bought Five Ten for durability. They were designed to perform and be comfortable on granite for the most part and they don't do that very well anymore.,May 2017,Nov 23 2019,1
29,Adidas owning 5.10,2,4, I generally like 5.10 shoes and have owned many different pairs over the years~ but my experience with them lately (like last 6 months) has been awful. I've sent at least 5 pairs of shoes back due to sizing issues. And just to add insult to injury~ I got a pair of Hiangles from the recent sale that fit but one of the shoes they sent has exposed stitching and is delaminating on the side. I would've been done with them long ago but I'm trying to use a gift certificate... super frustrating.,Feb 2013,Nov 25 2019,0
30,Adidas owning 5.10,2,5, Interesting to find this thread because I have been wondering about this. Have been using 5.10 products for over 30 years and they have ALWAYS had quality and sizing issues. They have also pretty much been the high-performance standard even with said issues. Sad to hear people think they are getting worse. I found this thread while searching for 5.10's new website to buy some new shoes. Yikes. ,Jul 2018,Jul 6 2020,0

32,Adidas owning 5.10,2,7," Been climbing in 5.10 shoes for about 10 years. Love my pinks~ quantums and mocs.

33,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,0," I was just thinking about this. A factor two falls puts a much higher shock on the climber and the anchor system than a factor one fall. But a ""soft"" catch~ such as was required before modern climbing ropes were invented~ would reduce these forces to something safer. A soft catch is tricky to practice~ however~ which is why in the pre-modern-rope era there was the saying~ ""the leader must not fall."" But~ what if there was a device like a Grigri that had a ""soft catch"" mode that would gradually (but obviously very quickly) slow the fall~ thus reducing peak forces on the anchor to something safe? Ideally this mode could be quickly shut off by flicking a switch in the device after pro is placed above the anchor. Any thoughts on this?",May 2020,Jul 4 2020,0
34,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,1, 1/10 Soft catches are overrated in the outdoors unless you are climbing some bad ass overhang route.,Jun 2016,Jul 4 2020,59

36,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,3, Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week,Mar 2014,Jul 4 2020,44
37,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,4, To get the precision required to do a soft catch correctly in different circumstances you need a computer. Our brains are that computer. I think that building a purely mechanical device that could perform a soft catch and was also simple and reliable enough to use for everyday belaying would be very challenging. Plus it would probably do the wrong thing most of the time.,Jul 2019,Jul 4 2020,33
38,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,5, Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week Next week doesn't help much~ but if someone could spike me into next year~ that would be great. I think I have had enough of 2020.,May 2015,Jul 4 2020,106
39,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,6, Even with our brains computing the forces there isn’t much you can do to soften a FF2 fall when using a Grigri. The OP had the idea that the soft catch feature could be turned off. You are only in  FF2 territory until the first clip is made~ then shift into normal belay mode.  I agree it would be a challenge to make the device but the concept is interesting. ,Jan 2013,Jul 4 2020,1
40,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,7, Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week Can you explain how spiking happens on a less than overhanging route?,Jul 2019,Jul 4 2020,7
41,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,8, Better to just install autobelays on all outdoor routes and slowly lower everyone when they fall. ,Jan 2016,Jul 4 2020,33
42,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,9, thats what the rope is for. you can also modify your belay geometry to eliminate factor 2 fall,Sep 2010,Jul 4 2020,2
43,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,10, Who is taking factor 2 falls routinely? Who is even taking factor 1 falls routinely? Most lead falls are like factor 0.5 or less~ unless you've done something really~ really wrong. What you're talking about could only happen in those first few feet between leaving an anchor and placing your first piece on a multipitch. And that's only if the multipitch is actually steep and vertical. The follower should be connected to the anchor with their rope~ which will help to absorb the shock. ,Oct 2013,Jul 4 2020,18

47,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,14, I think the answer is similar to the answer to the question “Why aren’t Yates Screamer dogbones more popular?” The market doesn’t demand a supply.

What kind of impact/force reduction is already offered by an ATC~ pilot~ megajul~ gri-gri~ cinch~ revo~ whatever...

50,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",1,17," Sounds complex~ I'm trying to think of what sort of mechanism could give you a reliable soft catch.  Hmm....  I guess you could have a mechanism that releases the GriGri a little~ just like the lever does~ when the device is pulled away from the belayer using a spring or something. If the spring is set so it takes~ say~ a few kN to pull it there you go.  Maybe it could even be a thing you put on a regular GriGri rather than a new device. Though~ I feel like most of the chill trad routes I do have a place to get a bomber ""Jesus piece"" in coming off the belay~ so it's not hard to minimize the chance of a factor two fall.  How many routes out there have belays where you can't really avoid being in a factor two situation?",Sep 2018,Jul 4 2020,2

61,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",2,7, Spiking is a result of penduluming into the wall on a very short fall on overhanging ground.  Lengthening the fall puts the overhanging wall further away and allows the leader to hit with reduced impact as their pendulum crosses the vertical and starts ascending.  On less than vertical ground~ the pendulum never crosses the vertical (obviously) so there is no impact reduction~ and meanwhile adding length to the fall risks smacking the falling leader into features or ledges.

62,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",2,8, For the people liking Artem's posts: Read the bold part and take the time to understand it. A soft catch will reduce the speed of the climber before they come in contact with the wall - a hard catch won't do this and more deceleration will occur when the climber comes into contact with the wall (this rapid deceleration is what causes the injury). You will always have flight time before you touch the wall on a vertical wall (less than overhanging) - the only time you wouldn't is if you are on a slab (less than vertical).,Mar 2014,Jul 4 2020,6

I looked up the video because I essentially agree with you from a physics perspective~ but it doesn't align with my personal experience. The portion of the video where the climber is 0.5 m from the pendulum point models a vertical~ not overhanging~ route pretty well (IMO).  My ass is often 1.5 feet from the wall when climbing~ and if I fall doing something dynamic I would imagine it could end up out even farther than that. The video concludes - through mathematical analysis and empirical modeling - that climber speed as they impact the wall is lower with a soft catch in that situation. The data shown when demonstrating this convinced me that the same would be true on a slightly slabby route. ,Mar 2009,Jul 4 2020,2

116,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,2," I'm seconding this because the original quote has 12 misinformed likes and counting.  Besides that~ the ""soft catch"" proposal for Grigris isn't about spiking the faller~ it is about reducing the maximum impact load to the gear and team.  That happens because some fall energy is dissipated by friction when the rope is allowed to run under tension.   Spiking is a result of penduluming into the wall on a very short fall on overhanging ground.  Lengthening the fall puts the overhanging wall further away and allows the leader to hit with reduced impact as their pendulum crosses the vertical and starts ascending.  On less than vertical ground~ the pendulum never crosses the vertical (obviously) so there is no impact reduction~ and meanwhile adding length to the fall risks smacking the falling leader into features or ledges.

117,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,3," I think the whole debate has assumed semi-religious overtones with neither side wanting to give ground.  It occurs against the background of the sometimes contentious trad-sport arguments~ with each side claiming superior knowledge the other side doesn't have~ this in spite of the fact that many people do both types of climbing. It has been established that when hard-locking belay devices like the Grigri are employed~ properly-timed soft catches can reduce impacts to the anchor.  In fact~ the entire soft-catch concept took hold because of the ""hardness"" of the autolocking belay.   The variability in the effectiveness remains an unaddressed issue~ as people speak of a soft catch as if it is an unvarying intervention unrelated to the host of conditions surrounding the belay event.  From this perspective~ a tendency has evolved to blame the belayer for everything untoward that happens to a falling leader~ as if the soft catch was some kind of magical shield against all possible injury~ hence any injury becoming prima facie evidence of belayer misconduct. The issue of spiking has to do with the effects of penduluming into the rock~ and is not necessarily the same as reducing the load to the anchors; this is another area where the soft-catch discussion is muddled~ as the only published test results I've seen have to do with anchor loads~ not pendulum impacts.  The video linked above is one of the few sources of information about the results of pendulums~ and as I mentioned it looks as if~ in the more nearly vertical situation~ and especially with short falls~  that the climber might be  ""spiking"" before the jump can mitigate the pendulum effects.  This doesn't mean the soft catch might not have some application to single-pitch trad climbing~ but it does mean that extrapolating from other experience is fraught. We'd all be better off if we could get away from the smug proclamations and admit we know a lot less than we think.",Feb 2008,Jul 5 2020,22
118,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,4, Is this a bad idea? Does a bear shit in the woods? yes. A soft catch is just super incredible easy to master.

120,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,6, Seems this is solved pretty easily by just seeking out a rope with lower impact rating rather than the voodoo of jumping at whatever you /think/ is the right time to jump.  As Rgold mentioned~ without actual~ personal~ measured data on the forces involved~ and a lot of practice~ you never really /know/ it you’re actually doing anything productive~ or making things worse.,Jun 2019,Jul 5 2020,5

125,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,11," Sheesh~ people.... There are a few Grigri type devices that do allow a bit of slippage~ the mad rock lifeguard being one. Mad rock also offers the Safeguard~ with no slippage~ for rescue and gym applications. Problem is~ that ""lock even when the belayer drops dead"" thing is why people buy grigris or the like~ the ""hands off"" ""foolproof"" device~ and then stuff that Grigri into the hands of a totally inexperienced belayer...and wonder why things didn't go so swell. An on/off switch is an interesting idea...but then you're right back to the competence of the user. Overriding the cam is already a huge operator error. That slippage is probably best left to experience~ or~ pick how you belay carefully~ if you plan to blow out anchors regularly. I'm too lazy to hunt it up~ but Jim Titt has a spiffy chart showing how different devices lock~ or not~ the forces involved  And yes~ grigris are hard stop~ ATC and others less so. But it's a curve~ so more interesting than just hard and fast numbers. My guess is~ all the other factors will add up more than the belay device~ such as rope out~ drag~ climber/belayer weight~ terrain~ etc. I expect the other styles of assisted braking devices vary too~ there's a lot more on the market these days than ATC and Grigri. I've seen claims for the Alpine Up to auto lock~ unassisted~ but of course even Grigri instructions say use your brake hand. IIRC~ Munter and ATC are the gentlest~ but an experienced belayer that cares is still best~ IMO.  By the way~ can too go past a vertical line on a less than vertical route~ way~ way past.  Don't forget about climbing to one side or the other of that plumb line and setting yourself up for a nasty pendulum into whatever awaits beside you.

130,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,16," I have inadvertently done it.  Lightweight climber (~100lbs)~ heavier belayer (~160lbs).  Climber was approximately .5m above the bolt~ with about 10m of rope in service.  Granite slab climb~ just less than vertical with a short crux of almost vertical terrain.  Climber fell and I gave an unintentional hard catch. The climber fell out slightly from the wall then the rope came tight and she accelerated into the wall and twisted her ankle. I'm genuinely curious. Do you mean your climber bounced away from the wall and then you pulled her back in?

131,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",5,17," You're probably right about that. It's worth noting that this is a thread that started with someone asking about creating a device to ""soft catch"" on Factor 2 falls. Which~ by definition~ only really happen in multipitch scenarios. Given that a belayer MUST be anchored for there to even be a fall factor 2 happening the whole debate about REAL soft catches (which~ again~ are a great trick in overhanging~ run-out situations to keep your climber from hitting the wall when they swing back) was sort of a non-sequitor. It's pretty hard to jump toward your falling climber when on a hanging belay at a multipitch anchor. The most bizarre soft catch dogma I've seen~ though~ was by certain testers at my gym when giving lead belay tests. A person I know was failed on her lead belay test not because she failed to stop her climber or did anything wrong but because she didn't ""jump"" and give her climber a ""soft-catch"" on a juggy 5.10a climb that was dead vertical with lots of stuff sticking out of it. In other words~ not actually a place where a soft-catch is ideal. But this poor person is now likely to go through her entire climbing career thinking that you must ALWAYS jump when catching a fall or you're doing something wrong. ",Jan 2016,Jul 6 2020,2

167,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",7,13, Not you. Artem was essentially saying all catches should be soft catches.  Since I am bored - yes I agree that all catches should be soft. Of course~ if you hit a ledge or something else the catch stops being soft. Hence~  a soft catch is meant to prevent you hitting things/ledges/ground hard.  See - definition of soft catch is not that hard.,Feb 2012,Jul 6 2020,3

I'm the lighter partner~ and granted~ I don't lead much~ but I do fall lots and lots when I do~ lol. We pretty much always climb on my rope~ and my partners are usually heavier. Sometimes much heavier. And yet~ no one has ever attempted a ""soft catch""~ and no catch I have had has ever been anything I'd object to.  So why is that? Just beginners luck? Or~ would my rather stretchy newish rope make a difference? I know it adds a lot to the falls my big guys take if they peel (I keep that in mind~ especially close to the start)~ and they lose a fair amount of ground if they hang to ponder a move very long. So~ rope a factor in soft versus hard? I'm not talking static~ obviously~ just whatever rope you usually climb on. Just curious. By page 7 anything's fair game~ eh? Best~ Helen",Aug 2015,Jul 6 2020,0

My rope is springy enough thank you~ and there is always some slack in the system~ don't be giving me any more to allow me to hit a ledge.  I usually outweigh my partners~ and am more concerned about bashing them into unconsciousness in a fall rather than getting the softest possible catch.

177,"Why not make a ""soft catch"" mode for Grigris for potential factor 2 falls?",8,3, Now I am going to say~ OP making a gri gri like you mentioned with a soft catch feature would be extremely difficult because the GriGri cams on the rope to stop it and there has to be so much force involved and then it is either an all or nothing cam. Soft catches are best given by the belayer themselves after they have read the situation and have the experience to know how soft to make the fall (it could be a hard catch or it could be a super soft catch depending on what best fits in the situation). And finally guys~ soft catches are something that we can all agree that no one can agree on. I have had soft catches on slabby climbs that have been quite nice~ and I have had soft catches on over hangs that have kinda sucked and I wished my belayed would have made it a hard catch. The moral of this story is which is better soft catch or hard catch is based purely on preference. They both have situations that can be dangerous and both have times when one would be better over the other~ but lots of the time either one works and as long as you are caught it doesn't really matter how it happened just that you didn't deck and that you didn't get decapitated on an overhanging ledge.  Last thing~ throwing personal insults at other people's comments doesn't improve your own point. I personally am a fan of soft catches because I have hurt my back getting a hard catch before in the past~ but I can see the merit behind getting a hard catch in certain situations. ,Apr 2019,Jul 6 2020,1

180,BD Ultralight Camalots Trigger Wire Repair - possible to make these more stout?,1,0, I've broken several sets of trigger wires over the years - it seems the only BD-supported way to repair them is to send them in for service. The UL trigger wires seems flimsier. Has anyone come up with a way to replace these wires with something a bit more substantial?   I do recognize that these cams are as light as they are because they trimmed all the grams~ and the irony of thinking about doing anything to them that would increase weight. But the wires do seem to be a weak point~ and maybe worth adding a tiny bit more mass. ,Dec 2015,Jul 6 2020,0

184,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,0, Hey~ I was wondering what do you guys usually carry on your harness besides normal protection like quick draws or trad protection? My current rack for relatively short less than a day single and multi pitch climbing from left to right is: - 120cm sling for attaching light belayer. - 60cm sling for making a lanyard if needed. - Another 60cm sling for random use. Both have a small screw gate. -Two medium size HMS screw gates for anchoring etc. - Grigri. Good for climbing with single rope. Not that useful for double ropes or two followers. - 240cm sling for trad anchors. -Water bottle for long trad routes with a small screwgate. -ATC and two HMS screwgates for belay. -Ropeknife with a small screwgate. -Two prusik's with one small screwgate each. - Microtraction with a light HMS screwgate. -Two 120cm slings for self rescue and extending pieces etc.,Jun 2019,Jun 29 2020,1
185,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,1, Seems like a lot of redundancy. Youll know after a while what you use and dont use. Leave the stuff you dont use. Regardless of how much you bring~ itll just be weight training.,Sep 2017,Jun 29 2020,28
186,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,2, That’s for sure more than I carry.  The only item that is 100% of the time consistently on my harness regardless of what kind of multipitch I’m doing is a wiregate with a very small amount of athletic tape around the spine~ (for ‘locking’ non-locking carabiners) a Hollowblock~ a tiny knife~ and a microtrax.  Everything else depends on the larger context of the route~ but is usually some variation of this: 120cm dyneema sling on a single locker for general use Single belay device. (Usually a camp ovo with two lockers or a grigri with one) Single locker for cloving in or a dedicated tether with locker if rope-solo-seconding.  1 anchor setup per person (usually a 240cm dyneema sling or a cordalette) Sometimes I have an extra wiregate for the microtrax if I’m hauling pitches on a free climb  Everything else (Prussiks~ extra slings~ lockers~ etc. is redundant or better carried in a small pack.

On one hand what you choose to carry is your affair~ even if its more than you strictly need. So whatever you want~ to a large extent.On the other load yourself too much and you might not be able to squeeze through that chimney and you may get to the end of every pitch of the route with most of that shit still hanging there on your harness~ unused. If you didn't use it you didn't need it. Try eliminating any piece of gear you didn't use on your last outing~ if you want. I prefer to strip optional gear out of the equation.,May 2015,Jun 29 2020,3
191,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,7, Why not rappel on your gri gri and pass on both of the prusik's :)? I used to bring pruskiks too~ but then i started using my 60cm slings as a prusiks. They're not as smooth~ but since i don't prusik regularly I don't mind. I also bring 2x 120cm slings but i have mine on Camp nano 22 wire gate carabiners and can't say that i've ever wished they were lockers.,Feb 2016,Jun 29 2020,2
192,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,8, If using a plate style device~ there's definitely no need for more than three lockers (one for atc/one for guide mode masterpoint/one for your tether/clove). If you're climbing runout routes where a single protection point failure (i.e. freak accident of biner becomes unclipped) you can always double up opposite opposed nonlockers.,May 2020,Jun 29 2020,4
193,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,9, Yeah uh oh there's 16 lockers in the pic. Yikes :D Yeah I know it's overkill. That's why I asked. I do take beginners to climb quite often and they regularly forget their stuff on the ground.

194,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,10, Instead of prussiks and extra slings~ I include two nylon slings as a part of 2 of my alpine draws. These work as prussiks and won't melt if you use them as a third hand.  I think a lot of your extra slings are redundant if you consider that every alpine draw can be broken down into a sling for whatever off-nominal issue comes up. Definitely a lot of lockers on your rack. I've had much fewer when carrying everything with two newbie climbers. By my count~ all you need is: 1) Lower anchor master point locker 2) Personal clove hitch locker 3&4) ATC lockers 5) Upper anchor master point locker (since you'll need enough to build 2 anchors at a time for multi pitch) And then I bring 2x 240 cm slings to make both anchors.,Jul 2018,Jun 29 2020,3

198,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,14, It really depends on the area and type of climbing doing.  Sport:  if there's permadraws already hung~ its probably overhanging. So ill normally carry one or two draws and a hollow block cord. This allows me to boink up the rope easier~ by using a draw as handle.  If it's more vertical I'll carry a belay device~ Hollow block~ anchor setup~ bail biner~ nut tool (has a built in wrench) For sport multipitch I add to the above gear a micro trax and a small pully.  Trad multipitch: Belay device~ anchor setup~ 5-6 extra wiregate biners~ 2- D shape lockers~ 2 pear shaped lockers~  nut tool~ hollow block~ left hand ascender~ pully~ u ascend~  5 meters-7mm anchor cord.

199,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,15, As others have said~ it seems like an awful lot of stuff...  My extras generally are: A PAS with a locker~ but that is because I've used one for a while and am just used to it.  It I were starting over I would use a simpler personal tether (1 locker). Either a pre-tied quad (if there are bolted anchors) or a long cordalette (trad) either of them with 4 lockers (5 total). My Alpine Smart with a spare locker for guide mode belaying (there are 2 more lockers~ so 7 total)). An ATC on a locker for multipitch just in case (funny~ I have never dropped my main device but I have dropped my back-up ATC~ so now 8 lockers). A nut tool~ but only for trad routes (comes with a tether and clip). A water bottle for multipitch or if I am belaying from the top on a hot day (non-locker).,Jun 2014,Jun 29 2020,1

204,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,1,20, Why even five? I have one for my ATC/grigri~ one for anchoring myself~ and one or two for misc. use.

205,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,2,0, A rescue can be improvised~ only bring a microtrax if you plan on hauling your partner up. Skip the tethers if you're with a competent partner~ if you're bringing up an non leading second on a multipitch they can carry their own tether~ if they can't remember that they can't really be trusted to belay. And to answer the question 1 Dmm boa masterpoint 1 attache for atc + 1 superlight locker 1 dmm sentinal for my grigri I will have water on a locking biner but it's extremely rare that I'd be hanging it off my harness (250m routes in the scorching heat)  If sport climbing i will literally have 1 draw on me after I've put up the draws.,Oct 2015,Jun 29 2020,5

207,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,2,2, I can think of a few situations where 4 is what I'd want. One extra for piece of mind. Agreed. I will say that I almost run out of things often~ and have to improvise maybe 5%-10% of the time. IMO~ that's the point: to go as light and simply as possible without being a pain in my ass. If I am consistently using all of the things on my harness on most pitches while still able to deal with any emergencies that arise~  I feel like my system is appropriate. ,Mar 2009,Jun 29 2020,4

210,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,2,5, Well honestly I haven't needed the Microtrax for a real rescue situation. It's purpose is for rescuing unconscious leader(or a follower) where I have to fix the rope to the belay anchor and ascend up the rope to the leader and haul him to a new anchor I've just made. Also handy for hauling the follower over the crux. I do use them all quite regularly. You need one HMS per second to tie them in with a clove hitch. So If you have for example three seconds then you need three extra HMS screwgates. It's however newer happened that all three followers forgot their tie in biners on the ground. Small srewgates. Yeah I'have newer used them all at once but they are quite handy for making bomber anchors and threads and a attaching lanyards etc. I guess they could be replaced with wiregates.,Jun 2019,Jun 29 2020,1

We will bring a mirco and a 6mm or so aramide 65mm tag line to haul a small bag~ for shoes food water clothes ect.   Somtimes  we will fix  the line and follow the pitch on a mirco while the leader hauls.  In the scenario we each have a little more gear. Your rack has x number of alpines/draws Plus wires and cams ect plenty to draw from if you need to make more complex systems.

225,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,3,0," Ditto the ""Holy crap!"" comments!!! Most anchors are tied together with the rope and tie ins are simple clove hitch to locking biner. All slings~ doubles etc are part of the total gear avalable for leading~ anchors etc. I don't carry any extra slings for dedicated personal use. Generally use the first one cleaned when following as shoulder sling to rack cleaned gear. This is faster at belays than de-racking from harness. When it comes time to multi pitch rappel~ slings are tasked as personal tether and rappel device extension Dedicated personal gear: -ATC or ATC guide with HMS autolock biner -hollowblock or prussik and small locker for third hand or rescue -2-3 light lockers -nut tool -chalk bag with small pair EMT scissors in side pocket -bail biner doubles for hanging descent shoes -sometimes a water bottle -snacks in pants pockets",Mar 2009,Jun 29 2020,1

229,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,3,4, It really comes down to what you think needs a locker.  I dont build anchors with lockers just 2 super light wire gates and if it's a 3 point then a cam has a racking carabiner.  So for me it's just 3 lockers.  Belay device locker guide mode locker clove hitch locker.  If I bring a micro T it gets a locker.  If I'm bringing shoes they go in a pack.  If I'm rapping then no shoes.  Nut tool and prussic go on 1 wire gate.  Instead of a knife I taped a razor in a helmet (taped up and angled so I can't get cut) chalk bag on wire gate too.  If I bring water its in a pack (Camelback is great to drink and belay)  or the follower carries it. I could lose a lot of weight with lightweight shoes.  Gotta find some I like for cheap...,Apr 2015,Jun 29 2020,3
230,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,3,5, Multi-pitch Trad setup: - Grigri with auto locker as main belay device for both leader and (especially) follower- HMS screwgate to tether my climbing rope tie in to the anchor- Reverso and hollow block stored on old non-locking bail biner for rappels / emergencies - 2 more auto lockers to set up a fixed-point lead belay~ rap with Reverso~ use as master point with girth hitch/clove hitch/rap ring anchors~ etc. - double length sling on non-locker- triple length sling on non-locker - nut tool- water bottle on shock cord (Gatorade ftw!)So 4 lockers total~ including 1 on the grigri. 3 are auto locking~ mostly because I've had a couple screwgates jam closed on me. Exception is the HMS I use to tether myself~ which is a screw gate so I can clip it one handed. For single pitch trad I'll leave behind the triple length sling and water. For sport climbing I'll also leave behind the nut tool and one of the spare auto lockers~ but keep the Reverso/hollow block~ and double length sling in case I find myself needing to rap. For my anchors I try and use minimal gear and minimal knots favouring girth/clove hitches instead~ especially if it's a hanging belay. If I can clip a big auto locker onto a beefy backed up ring anchor~ that's my first choice for a master point. For 2-bolt anchors I'll use the rope to clove the first with my HMS and clip a bowline on a bight to the second bolt as my master point (banshee belay). For 3 point Trad anchors I'll use the double length sling to equalize 2 pieces with a girth hitch~ clove hitch my tie in to that~ then clove hitch the third piece with the back side of my tie-in. This assumes we're swinging leads. If we're block leading I'm more likely to use the double or triple length sling in a more conventional quad anchor~ pre-equalized~ or banshee belay setup~ but I really try and avoid busting out the triple length sling whenever possible - it's just too much material.,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,2

257,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,4,12, Thanks for all the answers. Keep them coming. :) It's interesting how everyone seem to have a bit different setup like their own flavor and no one have it exactly the same.  I now realise that my setup is so bulky because I regularly climb with two or three newbies who have no own eqipment or skils to use it. I guess this is not that normal practise.  What comes to belay it's kind of like rope solo climbing because they either newer belayed before or have limited experice with it. I do climb easy enough not to fall and easy enough for people who have newer climbed trad or rock before. With a competend partners I take a lot less. With leaders better than my level I tend to be very consiuos with weight. I just take the belay/rappeling equipment and a nut tool. I'll be cleaning after them anyway.  For the upcomimg weekend trip I'm going to take the mp's advice and try to climb with less. I understand less is sometimes more. More climbing meters with less weight. How is this looking?,Jun 2019,Jul 1 2020,4
258,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,4,13," If you know a climb has ""traditional anchors"" (talking bolts here) ie 2 bolts in vertical orientation with.a chain connecting them and a single rap ring you can carry a single locker as your entire anchor just clip it to the ring and bam master point.   Then just clip your clove and belay device to that masterpoint locker and Bob's your uncle.

260,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,4,15, I had to read this few times. I don't know about Bob D: but yeah this is the best method. I always feel like why would you build an anchor from sligs on top of the perfectly good and superduper solid anchor. For top roping ofcource but for stand there is no need to do that. It's quite usual that there's two rings and I've heard that top one is good for connecting devices and the bottom is meant for rope. Side note. For groups more than three the masterpoint locker is a very good idea. You run out of space if you try connect everyone to that top ring.,Jun 2019,Jul 1 2020,1

I use a $1 gas station cheapo knife with a 3mm keeper loop that's super light and have one wrap of tape to keep it shut. Nut tool is the kind with an integrated clip gate instead of requiring a dedicated carabiner. As others have posted~ a small amount of tape is useful for locking nonlockers when bailing.

278,What is your trad or sport climbing rack excluding protection.,5,13," When climbing trad you already probably have everything you might need in an emergency in your rack already. Use your runners if you need to make friction hitches. Use biners if you drop your rap device. Two wiregates are as good as a locker. Etc. As a side note~ it's funny that people on MP make such a big deal out of carrying ""too many"" lockers. If a few lockers are weighing you down~ maybe you need to get some modern ones. I carry midsized screwgates which are only 50g a piece. Grivel makes a tiny screwgate that weighs 37g - that's about the same weight as a BD hoodwire or a WC helium.

289,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,0, Hey~ I just launched a kickstarter for a new hangboard design. I'm curious if y'all have any feedback - we can still do minor edits to our design before our full production run. Thanks!,Jul 2012,Jun 17 2020,3
290,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,1, Nice! That looks slick! Very cool for apartment-dwellers who are scared of drilling or ripping down their door frame. Could you make a picture that shows edge sizes and hold configurations (i.e. 2 finger pocket~ 3 finger pocket~ 4 finger edge~ sloper~ jug)? EDIT: Also~ could other hang boards be mounted easily to this setup? Perhaps you could make a tier with just the mounting system sans-board for those who already have a board?,Feb 2017,Jun 17 2020,2
291,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,2, This looks like a great idea and could fit a need for a lot of people. Board almost might have too many hold options. I really like how the newer tension board just gives you a pull up rung~ 30 mm holds down to 8 mm; no pockets~ no frills. What about making your door mount compatible with most hangboards? Just a thought. Good luck!,Sep 2012,Jun 17 2020,1
292,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,3, ,Jul 2012,Jun 17 2020,1
293,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,4, Are the pinches interchangeable? Could I mount a plastic hold instead of the wooden pinch? ,Jul 2018,Jun 17 2020,0
294,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,5, You would have to modify the board a bit~ but it would be relatively easy to do. We actually mail the boards without inserts epoxied in yet (we include epoxy with the shipment). Do you have a specific type of pinch in mind?,Jul 2012,Jun 18 2020,3
295,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,6, You would have to modify the board a bit~ but it would be relatively easy to do. We actually mail the boards without inserts epoxied in yet (we include epoxy with the shipment). Do you have a specific type of pinch in mind? Looking at using either a half dome or a rectangle pinch block. With the rectangle~ would like to have ability to change the mounting angle so I can practice different pinch angles.,Jul 2018,Jun 18 2020,1
296,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,7,  Can you explain the value of having 3 different 30/20mm flat holds? If you want to train two fingers instead of three or four~ can't you just do that on a bigger edge? This is what I think some of the newer boards get right (e.g. tension): more edge sizes~ fewer gimmicky pockets.,Jun 2010,Jun 18 2020,1
297,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,8, Great idea! I'd love it if I could buy just the mounting mechanism (very creative)~ and not the hangboard (would prefer to use my own). Any chance you guys will sell the mount separately? ,Aug 2019,Jun 19 2020,1
298,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,9, Can you explain the value of having 3 different 30/20mm flat holds?

299,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,10, ,Jul 2012,Jun 19 2020,0
300,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,11,  Why not just leave some open space on each end and put T nuts there so users can add a pair of holds of their choosing? It would be best if the holds were mirror opposites~ but I guess you can't have it all. (Or are there pairs of holds like that? I'm thinking that system boards might have them.),Jul 2009,Jun 19 2020,2
301,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,12, Very cool design! It looks great. Since I have been hangboarding more than I ever wanted to recently~ a few thoughts on function: - Agree that I would much~ much rather have a wider variety of edge depths than pockets. E.g. I love boards where you have 8~ 10~ and 12 mm edges so you can progress at or near body weight. I find I use pockets very little.  - Slopers are useful for warming up (if they're easy) but not much for training since they're so conditions-dependent. - Holds more than 20mm deep are good for assisted one-arm hangs~ but not so much for 2-arms since you need so much weight. Also~ it's annoying to try to do 2-armed hangs when the hold you want is mirrored close to the center of the board so your hands are close together. So... maybe put bigger holds for assisted one-arm hangs towards the middle and smaller ones for 2-arm hangs towards the outside? - Make sure you've chosen the best outside radius for the edges. Hard to find something that feels good in all grip positions (e.g. tiny radii/sharp edges feel good for crimping but hurt a ton open-handed),Jun 2016,Jun 19 2020,2
302,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,13,  Yes~ this is exactly what I want. I hear you that it will make it a bit bulkier~ but don't put form over function here. People have strong preferences about the hangboards they like and don't like (I do~ at least). Putting an intermediate mounting board might not look as sexy~ but it's super functional and is where I think you're more likely to find a strong market of enthusiastic buyers.,Aug 2019,Jun 20 2020,2
303,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,14, Yes~ this is exactly what I want. I hear you that it will make it a bit bulkier~ but don't put form over function here. People have strong preferences about the hangboards they like and don't like (I do~ at least). Putting an intermediate mounting board might not look as sexy~ but it's super functional and is where I think you're more likely to find a strong market of enthusiastic buyers. The problem is that form and function contribute to each other. If your hangboard and mounting system don't look good~ then you won't leave them out and won't end up training as much. Plus a bulkier setup would be more of a hassle for setup/takedown and would be larger to store.  But I like your points! That will also be much less expensive to manufacture without all of the milled features. Thanks for the feedback!,Jul 2012,Jun 20 2020,0
304,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,15,  If your hangboard and mounting system don't look good~ then you won't leave them out and won't end up training as much. Plus a bulkier setup would be more of a hassle for setup/takedown and would be larger to store. Isn't the whole point of having the quick-release locks on it to make it easy to take down? I wouldn't care at all that it didn't look quite as sleek~ as long as I could take it down (which I would do even if it was the sexiest-looking hangboard ever~ because my bedroom door would be unusable with it mounted) and I got to use the hangboard of my choice. I don't think it would really even add all that much bulk~ either. In fact~ if you were planning to just mount a couple small campus rungs on the intermediate board~ it might even end up being less bulky than with the integrated hangboard.,Aug 2019,Jun 20 2020,1
305,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,16," I'm working on a mounting-system-only alternative this week! I'll see if I can add that option to the kickstarter page on Thursday. One question though: What's your ideal size for a blank mounting board? I'm leaning towards 28"" x 8"".  Thanks for the feedback!!",Jul 2012,Jun 22 2020,1
306,Easy-Mount Hangboard Design,1,17, Maybe comb through here or a similar page and pick what models you'd like to support? Popular compact boards like tension grindstones and beastmakers would be no problem on 28x8. The only question is whether you'd want to support behemoths like the trango rock prodigies that take up way more space. I don't know of many bigger boards besides the trango one that are actually popular~ even though they exist~ so idk if that's a use case worth designing around.,Jun 2016,Jun 22 2020,1

Specifically for climbing and kayaking. They are made from a similar fabric as bathing suit~ which means they dry quickly after sweat~ rain~ or river water. They have a zipped pocket in the back which is great for storing a car key when swimming. They have the tie strap around the waist to keep them from falling down. And they're super light-weight and stretchy which means they're cool~ comfortable~ and great for climbing.

990,Black Diamond C3 Trigger repair kits - what do they give you?,1,0, Hi all~  does anyone have experience with ordering a trigger repair kit from BD?   I have a broken trigger on a BD C3.  There's a round plastic grommet that holds the base of the wire~ inside the trigger bar - that part has broken.   Does the C3 repair kit that BD has on their website give you these plastic parts as well?  or just the metal wires themselves?   Link to product:blackdiamondequipment.com/e…,Jun 2015,Jul 5 2020,0

993,Black Diamond C3 Trigger repair kits - what do they give you?,1,3, Even if you can get your hands on the plastic part~ you wont be able to get it on the cable as they are threaded on before the cable is crimped/swaged onto the head.

995,Black Diamond C3 Trigger repair kits - what do they give you?,1,5," The trigger wire kits I have from BD contains no plastic parts at all. However~ they are labeled ""Trigger C4  BLKD 26024""~ so it might be different than the one you have in mind. More importantly~ I've heard rumors that BD does no longer make these. Does anyone have good suggestions for DIY material for trigger wires for C4 (the standard BD cam just before the ultra-light version)? I've a decent standard steel wire fitting #3 (which probably fits down to maybe 0.4). However~ the 0.3 cam uses a much thinner wire into the lobe and I can't find material that is stiff enough. Any suggestions? (right now I'm leaning towards going all ""soft"" with  a nylon fishing line).",Jun 2010,Jul 6 2020,0
996,Black Diamond C3 Trigger repair kits - what do they give you?,1,6, You cant have soft trigger wires with C3's. There are no springs in the heads of the cam. They are below the trigger and push the rigid trigger wires to expand the lobes. ,Nov 2008,Jul 6 2020,0

1000,Recommendations on hexes,1,0, Hello all~ I'm trying to get into trad climbing but I'm also a starving college student. As I understand~ hexes are a lightweight and cost-effective alternative to getting cams. Any recommendations on which ones are the best to get? Or should I just say screw it and purchase cams? Thanks!,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,2
1001,Recommendations on hexes,1,1, Buy cams,May 2016,Jun 3 2020,105
1002,Recommendations on hexes,1,2, Buy cams~ they are more versatile and quieter than the cowbells you reference in the op. ,May 2013,Jun 3 2020,6
1003,Recommendations on hexes,1,3, Love hexes. Bomber. DMM Torque Nuts are good (extendable so you save draws)~ Wild Country Rockcentrics are my next favorite.  If you’re getting the DMM get all four sizes. For the Wild Country 5-9. Don’t let the hex haters persuade you. ,Jun 2016,Jun 3 2020,20
1004,Recommendations on hexes,1,4, Purchase cams. They've never been cheaper and~ unlike hexes~ you can generally resell them for good value if you end up not liking trad.  If~ after hearing that~ you still decide you want to buy hexes the best ones are DMM Torque Nuts~ IMO. But~ seriously~ save up a few hundred dollars and buy a full rack of used prior generation BD C4s for about $250-$300. ,Jan 2016,Jun 3 2020,14
1005,Recommendations on hexes,1,5, I like the WC hexes much more than the DMM. For endways placements~ the WC taper allows more bite into the rock and less leverage outward from the rope. The DMM taper is bass-ackwards. ,Oct 2008,Jun 3 2020,3
1006,Recommendations on hexes,1,6, Cams unless you get a great deal on used hexes. ,Mar 2006,Jun 3 2020,1
1007,Recommendations on hexes,1,7, Learn about placing nuts in opposition so you don’t zip out all your pro. Get “Mountaineering Freedom of the Hills”~ lots to learn and costs less for brand new copy 9th edition than a set of old hexes or a new cam. ,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,1
1008,Recommendations on hexes,1,8,,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,1
1009,Recommendations on hexes,1,9, Awesome! Thanks!,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,0
1010,Recommendations on hexes,1,10, I too prefer the DMM Torque nuts over any other design.  Wired hexes are useless. Buy cams~ they are better,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,5
1011,Recommendations on hexes,1,11, Despite the multitude of hex haters out there~ hexes are lightweight~ versatile~ work in horizontals~ and are great to save for anchors. For knobby flaring cracks hexes can be bomber in placements that wont take cams. The dmm hexes are great and the largest BD hex is perfect for flaring fist cracks,Aug 2018,Jun 3 2020,10
1012,Recommendations on hexes,1,12, This is only a concern for your first piece of pro on each pitch and is easily mitigated:  place a cam for your first piece or use one of the bolts if its a bolted anchor or use the highest and/or best cam in your anchor.  ,Feb 2008,Jun 3 2020,1
1013,Recommendations on hexes,1,13, This is only a concern for your first piece of pro on each pitch and is easily mitigated:  place a cam for your first piece or use one of the bolts if its a bolted anchor or use the highest and/or best cam in your anchor.   I agree. Op spoke of using only nuts on a trad climb.  I will add: “...highest and/or best cam in your anchor” on a multi pitch. ,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,1
1014,Recommendations on hexes,1,14, Even though I rarely use hexes I'd say yes get them. Not the small ones (as small as a large nut) though. You can climb with a set of nuts and a set of hexes. You will probably want to dial back the difficulty and climb on stuff you won't fall on (passive pro is harder to place correctly and one set of nuts and hexes isn't a lot of pro so you may have some run out sections). And it's even more important to have a mentor who can critique how and where you place your pro. You could mock lead with this rack and start learning how to trad lead without worrying about falling on badly placed pro or runout sections. But you could get your feet wet. Then you could buy a set of cams and have the hexes as your doubles of those sizes. Then you'll buy a second set of cams and the hexes will gather dust 99% of the time~ but you may pull them out for alpine climbing when you want to go light and the technical difficulty won't be near your limit.,Oct 2011,Jun 3 2020,3
1015,Recommendations on hexes,1,15, 'Scuse me~ what?,Apr 2016,Jun 3 2020,0
1016,Recommendations on hexes,1,16, Say screw it and buy cams and a set of nuts. If you find yourself wanting doubles frequently~ get some (slung) hexes. They're way more finnicky~ but if you're climbing below your limit they'll work for keeping you safe. Once you get a second set of cams you'll likely rarely use them. There are placements where only a hex will fit~ but 90% of the time you'd be better off with a cam. They are great for anchors though. Alternatively~ find someone with the skills and tools to lead and buy them weed and beer. You'll be safer and learn a ton from climbing with someone more experienced.,Feb 2018,Jun 4 2020,1
1017,Recommendations on hexes,1,17, This is only a concern for your first piece of pro on each pitch and is easily mitigated:  place a cam for your first piece or use one of the bolts if its a bolted anchor or use the highest and/or best cam in your anchor.   It can be an issue anytime the rope makes a big change in direction.,Jul 2009,Jun 4 2020,1
1018,Recommendations on hexes,1,18, Wired hexes for sure.,Mar 2006,Jun 4 2020,0
1019,Recommendations on hexes,1,19, Metolius curve hexes But~ generally~ don’t think of them as a substitute for cams.  Think of them as huge nuts - for constrictions. Yes indeed. I have huge nuts.  ;),Apr 2006,Jun 4 2020,5
1020,Recommendations on hexes,1,20, 'Scuse me~ what? Let me clarify. hexes are lighter than cams and harder to place on lead as anything other than large nuts so they are a good lightweight option to have on hand for extra anchor pieces~ and when you are setting up and anchor they are far more versatile than cams and can be placed actively or passively~ can be slung around a boulder or chockstone~ and are great for cracks that are parallel to the face you are climbing that face the sky on top of routes or pitches where rigid stemmed cams are going to get tweaked or a nut might not place due to the pull direction or parallel sides of said crack.,Aug 2018,Jun 4 2020,1
1021,Recommendations on hexes,2,0, Let me clarify. hexes are lighter than cams  Not as much as people think~ though~ now that cam weights have been pared down. Wired Blue Torque Nut weighs 161grams. Same size BD ultralight blue cam is 167 grams. Regular c4 in that size is 181 grams.  I sometimes carry a green and a red torque nut as a 2nd set in the alpine because I enjoy them. And it's nice to have something that's easy to leave behind if you want to bail. But the weight argument isn't so compelling any more. ,Jan 2016,Jun 4 2020,11
1022,Recommendations on hexes,2,1, ^ Interesting because they look so much lighter. A BD #10 hex is 5.78 oz a #3 C4 is 7.1 oz. So the hex is about 80% the weight of the cam. I would have though it was much lower.,Oct 2011,Jun 4 2020,0
1023,Recommendations on hexes,2,2, Hexes are a great first piece of gear to buy~ since then you will also have the first piece of gear you will sell. Buy cams.,Aug 2008,Jun 4 2020,14
1024,Recommendations on hexes,2,3," Exactly. People used to tell me they were ""half the weight"" and I took that at face value. Then I bought a scale and got curious. Best way to save weight climbing is to replace heavy carabiners with light ones. ",Jan 2016,Jun 4 2020,6
1025,Recommendations on hexes,2,4, I wonder if hex development has stagnated since they are kind of an afterthought nowadays. Cams have made steady weight reductions over the last 20 years. Seem like hexes could have too.,Oct 2011,Jun 4 2020,0
1026,Recommendations on hexes,2,5, Not half the weight but you can have a large hex and a small Tricam or nut for the weight of a cam. And you can get a set of nuts for the price of a cam.,Mar 2020,Jun 4 2020,1
1027,Recommendations on hexes,2,6, What more could you do with it? That’s like asking “why haven’t they improved the hammer?” It’s a basic design~ I’m sure it’s as light and thin as can structurally be~ no?,Mar 2016,Jun 4 2020,1
1028,Recommendations on hexes,2,7, I like torque nuts a lot.   Don't listen to the haters. Hexes work well and are bomber. Some rock also just takes them really well. Now if you just climbing splitters I wouldn't bother with them. ,May 2018,Jun 4 2020,2
1029,Recommendations on hexes,2,8, If you insist on buying hexes get the dmm hexes. I have the wild country hexes I bought off ebay for a good price when i was first starting off in trad climbing and even though i seldom use them~ I wish i had the dmm version. ,Feb 2018,Jun 4 2020,0
1030,Recommendations on hexes,2,9, Complete waste of money ,Feb 2013,Jun 4 2020,3
1031,Recommendations on hexes,2,10, Theyre not as easy to set or remove as a cam.  I think wires on hexes really suck. Also~ the solid hexes~ the small hexes~ suck.  Nuts are better in the small-hex range.  I significantly prefer the BD hexes~ slung w cord.  I have also used hexes as hammers~ slings~ and rappel devices.  They are good at belays~ cause you're standing in a spot to fiddle w em w both hands.   Theyre cheap to bail off of.  I carry them on long alpine routes~ because a handful of big hexes is light~ is another handful of gear options~ and if you have to build a dozen rap anchors to get outa there~ you have wide options.  Not all the bail cracks take nuts. Protecting a 5.10 pitch w only hexes/nuts/tricams is Really hard.  You'll want cams to climb hard.,May 2003,Jun 4 2020,3
1032,Recommendations on hexes,2,11, What more could you do with it? That’s like asking “why haven’t they improved the hammer?” It’s a basic design~ I’m sure it’s as light and thin as can structurally be~ no? I would bet they could be significantly lightened with an engineered structure (as opposed to a solid uniform thickness wall). Some old hexes had circular holes in them (probably drilled). A modern hex could use a structure similar to cam lobes. Look how much cam lobes have evolved in 20 years. But probably not worth it investment wise due to the limits sales numbers of hexes.,Oct 2011,Jun 4 2020,1
1033,Recommendations on hexes,2,12, If you are new to trad climbing you probably shouldn’t be leading on hexes. If I had to lead a climb near my limit with a rack full of hexes~ I’d be pretty damn nervous.  Cams are much easier to place and more versatile which you’ll appreciate as a new leader.,Apr 2017,Jun 4 2020,2
1034,Recommendations on hexes,2,13, #7~ #9 and #11 is all you need. ,Oct 2013,Jun 5 2020,0
1035,Recommendations on hexes,2,14," Picked up some of the larger WC hexes and found them to be very ""tinkly"" sounding (vs. clanky).  So if the noise factor is important to you~ there's that.  I still prefer the BD/Chouinard style but slung on cord (vs. wired).  Having said that~ hexes usually get left behind these days.  Sometimes will rack one biner with BD 4-7 on long pitches.  The small wired ones look attractive~ but (as someone said upthread) are redundant and rarely fit better than a similarly sized nut.",Aug 2009,Jun 5 2020,1
1036,Recommendations on hexes,2,15, I started climbing with hexes in the 70’s and early 80’s. They work fine and are bomber when well placed ( and yes occasionally they are the only piece for some constrictions in a crack - but skip that placement and put a cam above or below it).  A cam allows many more options for use on a pitch and they are faster to plug in on hard leads. They are also more versatile across many rock types. As previously stated cams weights are now similar. I still have a lot of hexes but only bring them into the mountains where I carry a few when attempting new routes as they are cheaper and I prefer leaving them behind if they are bomber in situations where I need to bail off the wall. Just commit to buying a double set of cams to three inches (plus a big one) and some wires plus light carabiners  and you will be able to climb pretty much any trad route anywhere (except Elbstanstien where you need knots) with more safety than if all you have is hexes. ,Jun 2006,Jun 17 2020,2
1037,Recommendations on hexes,2,16, Hex placements make adventures seem more adventurous. ,Mar 2006,Jun 17 2020,5
1038,Recommendations on hexes,2,17, I hate to say this but when deciding who’s advice to take on buying cams or hexes it might be a good thing for you to look at the grade that those people who are telling you to buy hexes climb at. I know it’s true that all the old greats used hexes back in the day and ‘they climbed so much harder than us’ but you can make your own decision if the people who are giving you advice to buy hexes top lead grade is 5.8 trad. If you start looking at people that climb harder and ask them if they climb with hexes you probably won’t get too many people that do that anymore except for nostalgia. Make your own decision obviously. I’d buy cams.,Feb 2009,Jun 17 2020,7
1039,Recommendations on hexes,2,18, Funny you repeat what so many have said yet I see more n00bs with triple racks of cams flailing way more often than I see experienced climbers with a light rack. I wonder why?,Mar 2006,Jun 17 2020,0
1040,Recommendations on hexes,2,19, I don’t think it’s rocket science to understand why beginners are flailing with whatever gear they have. Beginners flail. That wasn’t my point at all. My point was when you start climbing higher level you trade in the hexes for cams because they are more versatile and convenient for when you’re on the sharp end. Unless you’d like to show me modern high end climbers (or even 5.10 trad climbers) that prefer to use hexes (not for the old school feel of it) on a regular biases?,Feb 2009,Jun 17 2020,6
1041,Recommendations on hexes,3,0, Oh~ a higher level eh? I better go buy more stuff so I can climb at a higher level!,Mar 2006,Jun 17 2020,5
1042,Recommendations on hexes,3,1, A person can set a cam incorrectly but guess what~ a person can set a hex incorrectly also. You’re using an argument that says that hexes are better because a beginner doesn’t know how to set a cam? I didn’t go to college but I think your argument is called a false correlation argument?(Correct me if I’m wrong~ I didn’t have a lot of the book learnin) It’s like saying a bike is safer than a car because teen drivers crash a lot. I mean...it’s your opinion man. I’m pretty sure the reasons people climb with cams is because they have more range~ more placement opportunities~ they weigh less and they’re quicker to place. You might think that beginners don’t know how to use cams but people who DO know how to use cams choose them over hexes for a reason.,Feb 2009,Jun 17 2020,4
1043,Recommendations on hexes,3,2, I'm still climbing on Hexes I bought back in the 70s.   I change the cordage out every once in a while tho.,Apr 2010,Jun 17 2020,4
1044,Recommendations on hexes,3,3, Something I find really troubling is that some new trad leaders only use cams. I actually went out with a guy who had a shiny new set of cams and didn't know what to do with the nuts I handed him when I said the pitch required them due to rock quality and placement options.,Sep 2018,Jun 17 2020,3
1045,Recommendations on hexes,3,4, This is exactly how I got started...it took 20 years before I had what might be loosely called a “set” of cams.  I rarely use the hexes now but they got me started with some hand sized pro for 1/3 the cost of the same sized cams and they acted as doubles once I finally could afford a few cams.  I say get a set.  You will use them and never be sorry to have another tool in the arsenal.  Also~ get the slung ones~ not wired.  ,Apr 2020,Jun 17 2020,1
1046,Recommendations on hexes,3,5, Since my main crag is all single pitch trad~ I love building a rap anchor to be left at the top all day out of hexes. Much smarter in my opinion than leaving $100 worth of cams unattended 95% of the day.,May 2018,Jun 17 2020,1
1047,Recommendations on hexes,3,6, I’m new enough and brave enough to ask:  What makes wired hexes less than ideal? Any when or all the time? Truly need the education. ,May 2020,Jun 17 2020,1
1048,Recommendations on hexes,3,7," ""What makes wired hexes less than ideal? Any when or all the time? Truly need the education. "" I personally find equivalently sized cams almost always easier to place.  It's possible I am jsut a clueless gumby who is making choices because it's easier and faster.  Which seems okay to me.  The idea that maybe large cams are suprior to hexes~ and possibly nuts are superior to similarly sized hexes seems reflected in the racks of most of the folks I climb with or see climb (or guidebook listings~ or route descriptions or pretty much every place I see folks talk about what they are carrying). Personally~ if price was the issue~ I'd just make it a priority to climb with folks who already have a rack.  Cause if you're learning~ it would be way better to be following someone who has been doing it already~ anyhow. The fact we're mostly climbing with other folks~ and that their tastes and equipment may factor heavily in what goes up the climb~ seems glossed over in this thread. I can't even get my partner to take my tricams with him on his pitches.  And I -like- tricams. I have some old hexes from the 90s~ but I don't think I'd have any luck getting my partner to use those when we're climbing any more than my old rigid stem friends.  I can barely get them to agree to take the couple of totems that I have and like instead of their equivalent x4 cams.",Nov 2018,Jun 17 2020,0

1057,Recommendations on hexes,3,16, Even when I first started leading trad I pretty much knew how to place everything correctly. I wouldn't be trusting my life to gear I didn't know how to place. I climbed with a few mentors. Practiced at the base of climbs. Then I took a course and the instructors gave all my placements a thumbs up before I led anything. The drawback of hexes are they are harder to place correctly vs. cams in 90% of the placements I see. They're only are easier in constrictions (placing them like a nut) and I don't see that in CA all that often. They are also not multi directional like cams. They are usually more suitable places for cams. Cams are easier and quicker to place. IMO cams are safer most of the time for beginners. Starting at least 10 years ago I don't see any proficient climbers in Yosemite carrying hexes. Some advanced climbers don't even carry nuts. The last page discussed weight. The fraction of hexes to cams is 8/10. Not much of a difference. As I mentioned earlier I'd still recommend the largest 3 or 4 size hexes for a cash strapped beginner just due to cost. They become the secondary pieces after your first set of cams. And save a little bit of weight for alpine or easy climbs.,Oct 2011,Jun 18 2020,0

1062,Recommendations on hexes,4,1, One of the great thing with the Torque brand hex is the long sling. There are a few ways in which you can carry them to mute the cowbell sound too~ by pulling some slack from the top of the hex and clipping that as well. I have run out of slings and just used the sling from the hex as a runner clipped to a cam.  When setting TR's I can usually get by with a set of Torque nuts~ a set of stoppers and a long static line. ,Jul 2015,Jun 19 2020,2
1063,Recommendations on hexes,4,2, Don’t mute them for god’s sake. That “hex sound” is much safer in Bear country.  Use cams and risk getting eaten by a bear.  ,Jun 2013,Jun 19 2020,5
1064,Recommendations on hexes,4,3, Of course cams are most preferred. Which cams? By following others and using their rack you will develop your own preferences.

1074,Recommendations on hexes,4,13, Ease of placement above you/out of easy reach. Wired hexes can be more difficult/not placeable in funky spots like pull throughs~ pockets~ and other weird spots where the constriction and the direction of pull aren't in line.

1075,Recommendations on hexes,4,14, How exactly do hexes walk?  They have no moving parts.   As the ropes jumps and wiggles~ the sling wiggles~ and the hex will pivot around on its contact points with the crack.  Just like a nut can be wiggled up and out by the rope~ a hex placement can be manipulated.  The flat side of the hexis so large~ a small rugosity (sp?) or two can keep it for seating well with a tug.  Thats another reason stiff wires suck compared to slinging with cord~ and the bennefit of a long sling.  ,May 2003,Jul 4 2020,1

After spending hours of looking through this forum and elsewhere I couldn’t reconcile the varying advice. I have a relatively wide Greek foot shape.

1094,sizing for all day,1,6, Like a TC pro or even a Mythos? Yes.  The advantage of the TC Pro is its comfort:performance ratio.  You can size them down and they’ll still be relatively comfortable after breaking in while retaining performance.  With the pointy toe and downturn you’ll have to size Katanas fairly big to wear them all day which may lead to dead space.  I’ve heard of people doing it but you have to have the right foot shape.,Jul 2014,Jul 6 2020,0

1098,Belay glasses,1,1," My mileage - stay away from plastic frames. They flex a little~ prisms will pop out. Not a big deal - a bit of crazy glue fixes it. Plastic will also break in the most inconvenient moment. I like original ""Belay Specs""  - they seem to limit field of view least~ but my wife dislikes them. She prefers ""Y & Y Classics"" - metal frames.  Both work over regular glasses.",Feb 2012,Jun 30 2020,3
1099,Belay glasses,1,2, I have been pretty keen on the Y&Y clip ups.  They flip up out of the way when you don't want to look through them and are more compact than other version.  Only problem is that the attachment clip to clip to your sunglasses or prescription glasses only accommodates a thin junction between top of lens or nose piece and the lens on the sunglasses or prescription glasses.  This is not a problem for prescription glasses as few have a large junction~ but many sunglasses have thick plastic across the top of the glasses and the attachment clip won't accommodate that and doesn't seem to accommodate being bent (part of clip is plastic and can't be bent~ the metal part of clip seems like it would break if you tried to bent it).  I inquired with Y&Y if I could bend them or otherwise accomodate my regular sunglasses and they just said they were built for prescription glasses.  I have a decent pair of sunglesses with thin junction~ so I just climb with those.  I rarely climb with my prescription glasses on~ but the clip up fits fine on those.   I have an old style petzl hard helmet with a pretty low rim and I have to tip up my helmet a tad to flip the belay glasses up and out of the way~ not a big deal and unlikely a problem with modern helmets.   My wife wears them flipped up when climbing and doesn't have issues (but not climbing hard stuff).  They have a small case that I keep on my harness and pop them into when climbing.  Nicer size format than the case for most other belay glasses. I have their classic glasses too~ but always choose the clip up and my wife loves them.  I will try to post pictures of size of cases later.,Sep 2018,Jun 30 2020,2
1100,Belay glasses,1,3, Agreed to avoid the plastic-framed ones.  Just find the cheapest metal-frame ones on Amazon.,Jun 2007,Jun 30 2020,1
1101,Belay glasses,1,4, Some prisms are different from others. I tried a couple different ones and couldn't use them. Then I tried a pair that a friend got from Alex Megos that were quality from Europe and they never set my vertigo off like the others did. I'm currently using the Metolius UpShot Belay Glasses and those aren't giving me vertigo either. Only used them for a year so far so maybe the plastic will cause issues~ but so far~ so good.,Aug 2018,Jun 30 2020,1
1102,Belay glasses,1,5, I like the belaggles more that the Y&Y~ but I am more used to them.  When I wear the Y&Y~ I feel like I have tunnel vision because the prisms are smaller.  That said~ as I have gotten older and ent back to wearing glasses~ I'll be buying the Y&Y clip ons.,Jun 2014,Jun 30 2020,1

1105,Belay glasses,1,8, I got the $20 cheapo plastic ones off Amazon and haven't had an issue with them except that the case zipper broke quickly.

My partner has the Metolius ones and they work well too,Jun 2015,Jul 2 2020,3
1106,Belay glasses,1,9, Just to give you idea of size of Y&Y clip ups & case compared with more traditional sized belay glasses (their classic version).  Those sunglasses have about the widest nose bridge that these clip ups would fit on - by that I mean it has to be quite narrow as the spring clips need to clamp onto the lens area near the nose and if frame is wide at top the attachment clip won't engage.  That being said~ the small format of these clip ups and the ability to flip them up out of the way while they are still attached is awfully nice (not affiliated with company~ my neck is just happy that I am using them) ,Sep 2018,Jul 5 2020,1
1107,Belay glasses,1,10, I purchased some Belay Specs about a year ago. I am quite happy with them and recommend them. Easy to get on and off over a helmet~ fit well over sunglasses~ the steel frame and nose pieces are adjustable so you can make them comfortable for your face~ and the field of view is wide enough I don't get motion sickness. The case takes a bit of getting used to~ but I find it easier than using a zippered case. I tried the Y&Y classics (metal frame) and they were too small for my big head. The temple arms did not extend far enough to reach over my ears comfortably. The bend in the temple arms started a few inches too early~ so the end of the temple was resting on my ear instead of behind it. I've heard good things about them but they just didn't fit me. If they fit you~ they could be a good choice. The CU Belay Glasses looked interesting~ but they were twice the price of the Belay Specs. I've been curious about trying a pair~ but not twice the price curious.,Aug 2019,Jul 5 2020,0
1108,Belay glasses,1,11, I have a super cheap pair that I use at the gym. They are fine and sturdy enough. I keep them in their case between climbs. I paid around $25 for them. ,Sep 2010,Jul 6 2020,1

I am a 42/42.5 in La Sportiva~ 42 in Five Ten~ and probably like a 44 in Evolv (I've never had a pair that fit my street size without a lot of pain). The Unparallels fit my foot a lot better than the Pinks and Miuras of the same size.,Aug 2016,Jul 4 2020,0

1117,Scarpa Mago sizing and fit,1,0, Anyone use these shoes (saw another thread that doesn't answer my specific questions)? Wondering how they fit compared to other Scarpa shoes. I have Vapor Laces (last yellow/black version) and 43.5 is tight~ 44 for more comfy but still tight. Vapor Vs (older) in 45 are all day gym shoes~ but too big for anything above moderate (for me) outside. The instinct line doesn't fit as well as Vapors~ too much front volume for the correct length. Anyone compare the fit of Mago (new version) to these? I will probably order 2 sizes and send 1 or both back. I've found little online about comparisons~ except one review said they run small and to size up. Wondering if I should order 43.5/44~ or 44/44.5 (or even 44.5/45 if they run that small). No local store has them or will order for me... Many thanks HfM,Aug 2019,Jul 5 2020,0
1118,Scarpa Mago sizing and fit,1,1, I am street shoe 10.5 and I have the Magos in 43.5~ they are snug but comfortable. The heel is kinda mushy~ which may have been less of an issue if I went down a half size. I have 43.5 Instinct S and 44 Chimeras that fit similarly~ snug but not painfully tight. Sorry I don't wear Vapors for comparison. I really like the Magos for their precision and comfort~ personally I'm glad I didn't downsize too much even if they don't heel hook as well.,Jun 2016,Jul 5 2020,0
1119,Scarpa Mago sizing and fit,1,2, Cool~ thanks. Might try a 44 and hope for the best. Probably end up a typical online shoe shopping fiasco.,Aug 2019,Jul 5 2020,0
1120,Scarpa Mago sizing and fit,1,3, I sized up to 41 from my 40.5 Instincts and i wish i had gone up to 41.5 They are doable~ but gnarly tight compared to the Instinct fit and the heel is still baggy. I imagine the heel will be baggy for most people regardless of sizing~ though i do tend to have a problem with a lot of shoes feeling baggy in the heel.,Apr 2016,Jul 5 2020,0
1121,Scarpa Mago sizing and fit,1,4, Ok~ maybe 44.5 then. I'm getting to old for ultra tight shoes. One tip for baggy heels~ put a thin layer of silicone caulking in there where there are voids and spread it around with your finger (with glove). Works pretty well. Liquid latex might work too.,Aug 2019,Jul 5 2020,1
1122,Scarpa Mago sizing and fit,1,5, Thanks for the tip! I'll try this on a cheap pair and see how i like it!,Apr 2016,Jul 5 2020,0

1124,How to insure climbing gear when living in your car?,1,0, Hi all - I am moving into my car in a couple of days after a COVID layoff in order to afford my student loan payments and also to enjoy some good climbing while I retrain to become a web developer. I am planning to live on BLM land in central Oregon and hanging out at Smith Rock. I have a small problem currently - I am trying to figure out a way to insure my gear (collectively worth ~15k) in the event that it is stolen from my car. I am going to leave some things at a friend's house that I either can't secure while living out of my car (bike) or that I can't use in the summer+fall in Central Oregon (ice+alpine gear+portaledge). That being said - I need to figure out how to insure the stuff that will occasionally be unattended in my car while I am out climbing. Does anybody have tips + tricks as to how to achieve this? Renter's insurance requires an address~ which I won't have. I need to secure my climbing gear since if it is stolen this will be a serious catastrophe. I tried finding some specialty insurers - but all of the outdoor gear specific links that I was able to find are expired and no longer in play. I'll be chatting with some insurance representatives tomorrow but would like some direction if anybody has had success with doing this with their own gear. I will not be selling any of the gear~ since I will be using all of it at some point or another.,Mar 2014,Jul 5 2020,5
1125,How to insure climbing gear when living in your car?,1,1, Many insurance plans have an optional to cover a specific item or set. Jewelry is a common thing to get this insurance for. What I'm not sure about~ and maybe this is the crux of your question is how those plans interact with cars.  I know my renter's insurance covers my stuff except when it's in my car.  Comprehensive auto-insurance covers theft from a car~ but I don't know if that includes some limit that would be less than 15k,May 2018,Jul 5 2020,0
1126,How to insure climbing gear when living in your car?,1,2, The crux is not having an address for renters insurance! I need to figure out how to get around that (without committing fraud) - and the qoutes I get for comphrehensive car insurance can be out of this world... ,Mar 2014,Jul 5 2020,1

1128,How to insure climbing gear when living in your car?,1,4, So far it fits into four bags (one haul bag stuffed full of ropes~ one haul bag stuffed full of hardware~ one bag stuffed full of ice climbing equipment~ and then my portaledge) which isn't so bad since two of those will be left in a friends gear room. ,Mar 2014,Jul 5 2020,0
1129,How to insure climbing gear when living in your car?,1,5, You can probably buy a “personal articles” policy from the same insurer who provides your car insurance. But be honest about the fact that you’re storing this stuff in your car~ which is frequently parked in public. The underwriter may decline coverage under those facts~ or may charge an increased rate. ,Mar 2006,Jul 5 2020,2

I need to figure out how to get around that (without committing fraud) - and the qoutes I get for comphrehensive car insurance can be out of this world...  What address do you use for your registration and insurance? Use that address. Also~ you definitely want comprehensive insurance~ living van life means a higher risk of hitting an animal (which is not counted as a collision)~ hail damage~ damage from falling trees~ etc. I pay $800 a year for some kickass Geico insurance. My renters is another $200 a year but covers $15k with a $500 deductible. MAKE SURE your renters insurance is for the replacement value~ not the current value. That way you get a check for the cost of the item~ in new condition.,Mar 2016,Jul 5 2020,1

1137,How to insure climbing gear when living in your car?,1,13," The real issue with using a ""fraudulent"" address is that if the claim is big enough (and to my mind $15k is ! ) the insurance company might investigate~ and if they do get that far and conclude you were living ""on the road"" and not where you say you were~ then they don't pay off and you've spend money for the policy plus losing your stuff. Pretty easy to find out you're not where you say...couple of phone calls to the neighbors and/or requiring the occupants of ""your address""  to submit a signed~ notarized statement (""on penalty of perjury"") that you live there.  Hasn't happened to me~ but a car insurance company once sent investigators to where a friend lived because they didn't believe it.

1139,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,0," So... I need an all-day trad shoe for granite/crack climbing and kind of a mix of everything. The TC Pros have always been on my list of shoes to try and they were on sale through Moosejaw. I went to my local shop and they were able to price match them which was awesome BUT the clerk (whos opinion I do trust. He is a long-time climber working at The Gear Room in SLC. Respectable shop with solid people who actually climb...) anyway the clerk... he said~ ""you known~ the Butora Altura is a better shoe for $40 cheaper"" (same price as the TC Pro with the price match sale). He went on to say that the Altura doesn't delaminate at the shoe bend like every TC Pro does~ it is hemp lined so it prevents stretch~ and the rubber is superior than the x-sedge of la sportiva. Really it came down to fit for me. La Sportiva shoes have always fit my heel very well and the toe box felt better. And~ the Altura had a significant pressure point on the side of the foot near that boney bit on the outside edge. So~ I went with the TC Pro.  My question is~ does anyone out there use the Altura and have you had any issues with the shoe? There are so many accounts and reviews of the TC Pro so I know what to expect but very few on the Altura. Looking to see if I made the right purchase and if I should consider taking the brand new TC Pros back for the Altura... Let me know! Also~ maybe it's worth it to also bring up any other shoes that might compare to the TC Pro/Altura? What about the Five Ten Grandstones? Or maybe skip the hightops and head for a Katana? Again~ I have an affinity for La Sportiva purely on the heel cup and toe box fit for my foot shape but always open to try new things. ",May 2014,Jul 5 2020,0
1140,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,1, Nobody loves cause my feet are too big.  I ended up with some alturas because the TC pros aren't big enough for me (I wear a 48/49 depending on the shoe).   They feel like a pretty nice shoe~ but I've only been climbing with them for a couple of months so I can't give a long-term report.  The only other compatible option for me at this size are the scarpa maestros. IMO go with whatever you think fits best.,Nov 2018,Jul 5 2020,0
1141,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,2, Might not be helpful~ but I got a pair of Evolv Generals and like them so much I sold my pair of TC Pros and I ain't going back. ,Oct 2016,Jul 5 2020,2
1142,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,3, I've got the orange Alturas~ and they take a LONG time to break-in.  Wish they were a bit more sensitive~ so perhaps resole with thinner rubber when the time comes and they'll be great.  Otherwise~ they're superb for foot jams and they're comfortable. I've also found the LaSpo's to be a better fit.  I use my Katanas/Katakis for pretty much everything~ but when it comes to crack~ I switch to the Alturas.  ,Apr 2011,Jul 5 2020,1
1143,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,4, The guys at The Gear Room turned me onto Butora shoes as well. I've had the Alturas for 2 seasons and a pair of the Mantras for one year. They both need a resole at this point but I feel like I've gotten good use out of them and they perform well. The hemp tops definitely don't stretch as much as leather so I'm much more inclined to pay for a resole compared to the all leather shoes I've had in the past where the uppers stretch too much to be worth it. I have a short and wide foot so I like that they have different width options~ although I was hard pressed to tell the difference in the store. As with all shoes though~ it doesn't matter how high quality are~ if the fit is off~ don't bother.,Jan 2014,Jul 5 2020,0
1144,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,5, TC Pros are the best shoe out there!   I absolutely love mine and have for the 20 months that I’ve had them and used them on everything from sandstone to dolomiti to granite and from slabs to edging and cracks. You made the perfect choice in my opinion!,Nov 2018,Jul 5 2020,0
1145,TC Pro vs Butora Altura,1,6, I'm happy with mine so far. They are almost ready for their first resole. They are stiff and well-built. At first I had a bit of regret about buying them because they put a lot of pressure on my Achilles tendon and did not seem to be breaking in at all. However~ they did eventually stretch enough to be comfortable for extended wear. I can wear them all day now. It is possible that they would stretch enough in width for you to be comfortable... but maybe not.,May 2016,Jul 5 2020,0

1149,Mammut Infinity Dry vs. 9.5 Alpine/Crag Dry,1,0, The line from Mammut has been that the new 9.5 Alpine Dry and the 9.5 Crag Dry are equivalent (or even upgrades) to the 9.5 Infinity Dry. The Alpine Dry and the Crag Dry have exactly the same specs as each other~ but not as the Infinity Dry.  Specifically~ the new ropes have more static and dynamic stretch as well as a higher impact force. There also don't seem to be any reviews of the new ropes anywhere. Has anyone used one of the new ropes? If so~ are they noticeably stretchier than the Infinity? In this video~ the Mammut rep mentions that the new ropes have a higher thread count which supposedly improves handling. It would be great to hear from someone who has tried them out...https://youtu.be/JSmOUNdKRJQ,Dec 2017,Jun 22 2020,3
1150,Mammut Infinity Dry vs. 9.5 Alpine/Crag Dry,1,1, I have the 9.0 Crag dry sender and it feels a lot more supple and smooth than the infinity dry I got last year. Not much stretch difference but only a few falls to compare on the new rope. ,Jun 2020,Jun 22 2020,1
1151,Mammut Infinity Dry vs. 9.5 Alpine/Crag Dry,1,2, Could someone explain to me how a rope with more stretch would have a higher impact force? It seems like the opposite would be true. ,Jul 2017,Jun 29 2020,2
1152,Mammut Infinity Dry vs. 9.5 Alpine/Crag Dry,1,3, Bump~ I'm interested in OP's questions.  Additionally~ is this why the Infinity Dry seems to not be available anywhere (is it being phased out?),Dec 2017,Jul 4 2020,0
1153,Mammut Infinity Dry vs. 9.5 Alpine/Crag Dry,1,4, The rope is a big spring right~ more stretch=bigger spring but if its a really soft spring it's not going to be able to put up much resistance in heavy loads so will bottom out quicker and more abruptly.  I imagine the harder catch is probably just tuning the hardness of the catch so it's a softer catch when it's around a ff0.5~ but I'm no rope maker so I could be wrong. ,Oct 2015,Jul 5 2020,2

On the flip side~ is it totally kosher to wear out some climbing shoes in 4 months and return them for a fresh pair because they ""wore out too fast""?

1156,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,2, Use your moral compass. If it feels wrong to use gear more than to figure out if it’s right for you then return it~ don’t do it. What some stranger (rei employee or random MP user) thinks shouldn’t drive your actions. Think of the intent of the policy and ask yourself if you are abusing it. ,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,20
1157,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,3, No doubt! TBH~ I'm was more curious than anything~ especially with all the online orders people have been doing in the last couple months.

1158,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,4, Quite a few REI employees and managers would like to see the return policy made stricter than it is now. No~ nobody encourages people to try new gear and just return it if they found a better option. A certain type of person will always think of that idea themselves. I'm inclined to agree with you~ if I picked the wrong product I'll just eat it. If I made a decent effort to get the size right and it doesn't fit~ or if the item is defective~ I'll return it promptly~ otherwise I bought it and I'll eat my mistake. I don't think I've returned more than 3 or 4 items since I joined REI in 1976,Jul 2005,Jun 29 2020,9
1159,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,5, Just keep in mind~ with most climbing gear it doesn’t matter how long you tried it out for. As soon as the item leaves the store it cannot be restocked so everything you return is going in the trash. Take an extra minute to try things on in the store and do your research before buying. ,Sep 2013,Jun 29 2020,10
1160,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,6, I've been encouraged by multiple REI employees to do just that in almost every section of the store. You don't like this tent~ use it a few times and bring it back. Climbing shoes don't break in~ just bring them back and we'll sell them at the garage sale. I think it's a pile of crap seeing shoes that have worn through the rand at the garage sale with a note saying~ 'Only used once~' but not everyone has a moral compass that works.,Aug 2018,Jun 29 2020,2
1161,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,7," Do REI employees judge you for your returns? Yes~ absolutely. In fact the record of your transaction history with REI has a KPI that scores your return habits. How much did you buy vs how much did you return? They also track your lifetime profitability to them. ""How much money have we extracted from X's wallet?"" ""How much more can we extract?"" Don't get confused by the bright shiny light over there. Yes returns are tracked. Yes your returns are tracked~ summarized and judged. But at the end of the day~ does the return policy (whatever that policy may be) drive profitable sales both short term and far more importantly~ over the long haul? Have you ever decided to purchase a thing you could buy at any number of retailers or ecommerce companies~ at REI solely because of the return policy? If the thought of ""I can return this if it doesn't fit"" or what have you~ moves or has moved you to pulling the trigger on an REI purchase~ then the return policy has driven your behavior and accomplished its one and only goal: drive more sales and drive more profits. If you become unprofitable and return more than you buy they judge you serial returner and your file is flagged and bam~ ""no~ sorry we won't accept returns from you."" = judged",May 2015,Jun 29 2020,6
1162,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,8, I’m an REI employee and yes~ we actually recommend trying gear out all the time. Obviously we push that for things we can actually resell~ but if it’s like a harness or any climbing safety thing~ we try to prevent a return by doing a better job recommending products~ because like Lethal Weapon II said~ we can’t resell them~ even at the garage sale. It’s definitely irritating when people return things that they’ve used for months before figuring out they don’t like it~ no matter what it is.,May 2019,Jun 29 2020,2

What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral? Returning any item drives up the store's operating costs and reduces the store's profits~ thereby reducing my profit sharing check that I get every 3 months. From a societal standpoint~ buying something with the intention of returning it later is essentially taking something without paying for it (i.e.~ stealing). If people want to try something for a while to see if it works for them~ they can rent the item.

I kept it around thinking I was crazy since it didn't have any visible tears. REI wouldn't take it back because it had been something like a year and a day~ even though it was an REI branded product that sucked.

1173,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,1,19, I worked at REI for a short period of time. Most returns were legit and most people genuinely wanted to only return items if they felt it was warranted. I only judged people if they were clearly using the return policy as a rental program: returning skis in May/June~ returning mountaineering boots that had no defects~ etc. This drives up costs for everyone and was part of the reason REI has dramatically changed their return policy.,Dec 2017,Jun 29 2020,4

He would buy shoes~ wear them for a year and then return them~ buy the same shoes etc. After only a couple returns management caught on to him and banned him from returning anything anymore. So~ he moved onto a different store and they caught on there too. It got to the point where they knew his name / face~ and they would greet him when he entered and would follow him around asking if he needed help. Eventually he went to stores in different states and they even knew about him there. They never asked him to leave but they were passive aggressive enough to make him uncomfortable in the store that he stopped coming around. Tldr: REI management tends to be passive aggressive af and they keep track of plenty of weird things,Apr 2016,Jun 29 2020,2
1175,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,2,0, Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral? Oh~ don't get me wrong~ it doesn't affect me at all as an employee. Irritated is just the way I feel about people taking advantage of the system (and it is a very fleeting feeling)~ and in no way do I think the return policy should change just because there are a few people who take advantage of it. I believe that's the price REI pays for having that policy anyway. Sure~ you could call it immoral from a societal perspective~ but it's mostly just how I personally feel~ and I don't impart my personal feelings towards the people that make the returns~ or people in general for that matter.,May 2019,Jun 29 2020,2
1176,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,2,1, I worked at REI for a little over two years.

1179,REI Employees- do you judge people who frequently return things?,2,4," I judge myself!  I just took a 70M Edelrid TC Pro rope in and returned it after the sheath frayed after 1 sport climbing sesh (with no rock rubbing).  I am not a person that returns things just because I wear them out/abuse them~ but some situations are warranted.  It sucked to see that rope get junked as it seemed like such a waste~ but it was defective.  Over the years I have returned almost nothing that I have purchased~ even when friends have said I should just take it back and ""get a new one"".   Breaking an item you purchased~ using the shit out of it~ or taking it back because you found something better is not grounds for returning an item IMO.  Neither is using REI as a rental store for that matter.",Sep 2018,Jul 4 2020,1
1180,New Scarpa Mago reviews,1,0, I've seen a few reviews in the blogosphere since these came out last fall~ but not much from real users. Anyone here on MP picked a pair up~ if so what are your thoughts and comments on performance and fit? Saw two complaints on baggy fit in the heel on backcountry~ seems like it has a ton of heel tension on the rand and would be easy to size too large with dead space behind your heel. My intent is steeper sport geared more toward edging~ so heel hooks aren't as important~ but I like to trust them when I need to. Current go to harder sport shoe is old testarossa and I have a few pairs. Use dragos for gym and most bouldering. Chimera comes out when I need a hair more edging bouldering. Shoes I've owned/have for refernce to compare~ instinct VS~ vapor V~ vapor lace~ skwama~ python~ katana lace.,Jan 2015,Jun 12 2019,0

1183,New Scarpa Mago reviews,1,3, I have 2 pairs and love them. Super powerful~ very sensitive but really good support in the front position (big toe platform is v stiff). Some people find a little bit of space under the bottom of the heel~ sort in front of the ball. Behind the heel not so much a problem.  Overall~ the heel cup is pretty small relative to forefoot width. If you like the instinct family you will likely enjoy magos as well.  I find them comparable to a chimera (big fav for bouldering) ~ although you also like dragos which i for one cannot get to fit in any size. Magos fit similarly to testerossas (original model at least) but are much more comfortable with not nearly the same break-in period in my experience. They should be similar as they were designed ~20 years apart by Heinz M~ arguably the most prolific/influential shoe designer in industry history. The underfoot/wrap-around randing is way ahead of the teste design in terms of how comfortable it is for the power/precision it provides~ as it doesnt rely on the achilles-busting slingshot heel rand that many shoes past and present use to produce power in the toebox.  Imo they're sticky AF~ comfy AF for what they are (super high performance shoe). They hook in on steeper than vert very well~ but also climb face and hard slab incredibly well. They are just horrible for long moderate crack climbs~ so don't buy them for that. :) Hope that helps. I work in the rock shoe industry fwiw. Side note they are blue-green~ colors which have been shown/proven to reduce stress and promote feelings of safety and wellness. Maybe that's the extra step needed for the send.,Nov 2012,May 17 2020,1
1184,New Scarpa Mago reviews,1,4, Thanks Alex~ great info in there. The blue-green color scheme sure looks more soothing and harmonious than the McDonalds themed Testarossas~ which seems to mentally amplify greasy footholds ;) Sounds like you know your stuff~ so in case you're feeling helpful... I'm looking for something to replace Testarossas for edgy sport climbing. Something that can handle a little hard-for-me trad/crack climbing would be ideal but I have tight TCs for that so not essential. I have low volume feet with long toes and small heel. Katakis seem close to perfect~ but are discontinued and can't find my size. Instinct Laces were too high-volume (especially in the middle and heel). I prefer to not have to size down too aggressively to deal with lots of volume. Does the Mago seem like a good idea to you~ or any other suggestions? Feel free to PM if we don't want to hijack Nick's old Mago thread. Cheers,Aug 2014,May 17 2020,0
1185,New Scarpa Mago reviews,1,5, Any size and/or fit recommendations for the Mago? I fit the Vapor Lace in a 44 very nicely for semi-comfort. A 43.5 fits tight as a performance fit~ and a 44.5 would be all day. The previous generation Vapor Vs I wear a 45 as a wear all day gym shoe~ and 44 would be a performance fit. The Instinct line doesn't really hug my foot and is a bit baggy for the correct length. Nowhere near me has Magos to try on~ but wondering if anyone has a size recommendation or if they find the fit comparable with the Vapors? Found a bit suggesting they run small~ so a 44 might be tight and 44.5 might be the money. Looking for a Euro limestone near vert to slightly overhanging shoe (Ceuse~ Siurana~ Frankenjura~ etc)...

1193,Kong futura hand ascender,1,4, I have one and use it more as a rope grab to haul a small pack. I’ve used it as an ascender simply to go very light (I was using a micro trax as my other “ascender” and only to ascend a limited number of ropes.) I wouldn’t take one on an aid wall simply to lighten the load~ it’s a little bit too finicky for that~ you have to pay a bit too much attention to it.,Jul 2009,Jul 3 2020,3
1194,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,0," My girlfriend and I recently bought a tag line. It's a 60 meter piece of 7mm accessory cord. We got it for alpine routes requiring full rope rappels and for emergency bails in thunder storms. We would have preferred to buy half ropes but couldn't afford it this summer. The tag line was $60. Maybe next year we'll get doubles.    We used the tag line for the first time on Petit Grepon~ which requires 6 raps to get off. The raps were heinous. We threaded the lead line through the anchor and tied it to the tag line with two EDKs. I clove hitched a locking biner into the tag line and clipped the lead line through it. I was told that this was the ""biner block.""    When we went to pull the ropes~ (we pulled the tag line) the lead line and the tag line started twisting around each other. The twists were above the knots~ so we couldn't untangle them. We had to re-ascend the rope to fix this.    On the next five raps we didn't use a biner block. We just threaded the lead line through the anchors and tied it to the tag line with two EDKs. We didn't die. The knot didn't get stuck in the anchor~ but I'm still not totally happy with our set-up.    So tips? How do you set up raps when using a lead line and a tag line? What knots do you use? How of you avoid death and tangles?   Thanks for your responses. And for the record~ I've already read Freedom of the Hills ;)",Apr 2012,Jul 22 2014,0
1195,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,1, You only rapped on the fatter line~ right?    I don't understand how the twists occurred. You didn't have any free-hanging rappels~ did you?,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0
1196,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,2," I've always understood the blocking binder to be for a ""reepschnur"" setup~ where the lead line bears all the weight of the rappeller and the tag line not only isn't threaded through the rappel device~ it may not even be strong enough to hold body weight. I've seen the reepschnur described and diagrammed here on MP~ and what I saw looked kind of scary.    I used a 7mm accessory cord tag line the way you described many years ago~ but I never used a blocking biner. I just tied the tag line and my lead rope together using either a double fisherman's or a EDK~ and left a long tail if I was using a EDK. If we were doing multiple rappers We would feed the side we were pulling into the next rap anchor to save time~ so half the time the tag line was through the anchor and half the time the lead line was through the anchor. The only problems I recall we're that the 7mm was more susceptible to abrasion than a fatter line~ and I it was more likely to jam in a crack while being pulled after a rappel. The light weight and low cost were really nice~ but rapping on a 7mm line so many partners nervous that I went to an 8mm tag line. The other problem was that~ if the tag line was through the anchor~ the knot would creep down from the anchor because of the difference in friction between the tag line and the lead line. We had to watch the ends carefully to keep from going off the end of the 7mm line~ even if we started the rappel with the rope ends perfectly even.   People get nervous about rapping on a 7mm line~ but the truth is that it's plenty strong. When hexes were still widely used~ it was normal to sling them with 7mm accessory cord or smaller.",Jul 2005,Jul 22 2014,1
1197,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,3, I think if the rope is pulled over a tight angle as it pulls~ it will twist and kink up like that. I have only seen that if you thread the rope through the bolt directly~ but I'm sure you didn't do that.   What tag line did you get? I'm in the same boat and need to buy a tag line but I can't find one for that cheap. A link would be great.,Jun 2013,Jul 22 2014,0
1198,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,4, We have used the 7 mil static tag line + lead rope system for years.  Since the tag line goes through the rap device easier~ it will creep unless you thread the lead line  through the anchor as you did.  As for a knots~ we just tie a figure 8 in one rope and connect it to a figure 8 in the other (figure 8 to figure 8).  The only drawback is that you always have to pull down the tag line on multi-raps~ so if a rope gets stuck on the way down it's likely to be the lead line.  Our system has never twisted up as you described.    What was so heinous about the raps on the Petit?,Jun 2011,Jul 22 2014,0
1199,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,5, i use the biner block you have described all the time i have never had an issue with tangling that you described.    What this the first time that you used the 7 mm cord? because the new cords often come in a spool and need some time to get the kinks out.   also~ I have comment about using two EDK~ although it would have nothing to do with the tagle. The EDK is a good knot to use on rappel because it is compact and can flip. The down side of the knot is that is a relatively weak knot and the tails do slip. Adding a second EDK make the knot way more prone to getting stuck and have little effect on tail slippage. So it is best to make a decision either go with a knot that is less likely to get stuck (EDK)or use a strong knot (double fishermen).    Presently you are using a weak knot that is most likely to get stuck.,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0
1200,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,6, It sounds like you're mixing two different methods.   Method 1: normal two-rope rap.  Thread the single rope~ join to tag line (EDK)~ rap on both strands~ pull tag line.   Method 2: biner block.  Thread the single rope~ tie to locker (overhand/figure-8 on bight)~ lock back to single rope on other side of anchor (note that single is now self-secure)~ tie tag line to locker~ rap on single rope only~ keep control of tag line (clip to draw on gear loop~ for example)~ pull tag line.   It sounds like you did a little bit of both.  With the EDKs and biner up there~ I'm not surprised that you had problems.   I personally do method 2.  Method 1 seems odd and perhaps unsafe due to the different rope diameters and types (static vs dynamic) through the rap device.   Regardless~ you're pulling big knots and potentially a big biner.  There's definitely potential to get stuck.  Always good to do the test pull while your partner is still up there.   Also~ it's totally up to you~ but you might want to reconsider two EDKs.  For me~ one properly-dressed EDK with plenty of tail is safe enough and much less prone to snagging.,Apr 2013,Jul 22 2014,0
1201,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,7, Also~ EDKs don't slip~ they roll.  There are some really good tests out there that IMO show that a properly-dressed single EDK with tail is bomber.,Apr 2013,Jul 22 2014,0
1202,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,8, Did you tie both ends of the rap line together for a stopper knot? ... Or did you throw them down independently?   ;),Mar 2009,Jul 22 2014,0
1203,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,9, Only marginally off topic~ an overhand knot is only an EDK if the tails are so short that when the knot rolls over on itself~ the tails roll in and the knot comes undone.   Like someone else said~ consider using only one overhand knot to join the ropes or switch to using a double fisherman's.  You will have a less tangle-prone setup.,Nov 2010,Jul 22 2014,0
1204,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,10, I have always rigged the rap so that I pull on the lead line.  This is easier to pull since the lead line is heavier and also if a rope hangs up it is likely to be the tag line.  The disadvantage is that the ropes creep~ but this isn't a problem rapping off a metal ring.  Just never rappel this way off webbing.,Jan 2001,Jul 22 2014,0

1207,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,13, Thanks for your responses.    To answer a few questions. I bought the line at outdoor recreation in SLC. They only charged us $0.30 a foot and I think it was a favor.    The line was brand new~ which may have contributed to the twisting.    The raps were heinous just bc of tangle. Repairing that situation lost us time getting back to the ground. When I got back down I discovered that marmots ate the tongues off my hiking shoes. But that's a different story.    What y'all are saying about one edk or double fishermens makes sense. I think I will use a double fishermens and no biner block. Last time I put both  strands through the ATC. I think I will continue with that.,Apr 2012,Jul 22 2014,0
1208,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,14, I also like the idea of not throwing the tag line~ but just moving it in and out of a small rope bag or stuff sack.    As for the tangling... Man I really don't understand it. We started pulling the tag line. The knot came of the edge towards us. I could see the knot moving. After a few feet~ the tagline became impossible to pull and I could see the ropes tangled around each other high up on the rope. The lead line was still near us~ which means we probably didn't pull down more than 15 ft of tagline. We ended up securing the tag line to me and the anchor~ then my partner climbed and self-belayed up the lead line with a GriGri. When she got to the tangles~ she built an anchor~ went off rappel~ untangles the ropes and then rapped back down the lead line taking the anchor with her.    Maybe we threaded the ropes through the anchor in some weird way. I don't know. The whole things was baffling.,Apr 2012,Jul 22 2014,0
1209,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,15, Could it be that accessory cord is wound onto a narrow spool~ and this tight winding makes it kink like crazy in 60m lengths?  I bought a tagline which was a 60m piece of static cord~ it was coiled like a new rope with no tight coils.   If you can hang your tagline free from one end~ it may get most of the kinks out.  Then butterfly it~ don't wind it into a coil.,Jan 2001,Jul 22 2014,0
1210,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,1,16, I've seen where pulling a rope through an anchor that has only one rap ring per bolt can twist the rope. If the rap rings are directly attached to the bolt~ there should be two per bolt (linked like a chain). Don't know the configuration of your rap anchors. Or if they were even bolted anchors.,Nov 2009,Jul 22 2014,0

1216,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,2,1, Alright Mr Archibald. Here is everything you need to know: EDK is totally good. Different diameter ropes are even stronger than same size 8mm. If you want a small back up because of your comfort level with the knot~ that is fine. Just tie the EDK~ then put a neat~ overhand in one strand and push it up to the EDK to reduce the likelihood of rolling which is next to nil anyway. Also~ with different diameter ropes~ be sure the skinny one is one the rap side~ not the tail side. This makes rolling more difficult. But~ EDK's don't fail. Biner block. Totally unnecessary unless rapping with grigri. Makes pulling ropes a bitch. The only place we need  {edited out by Admin}  Tangles on the petit. Let me guess~ it was the second rappel. Here~ the terrain is a bit slabby and the two ropes can wrap around each other quite easily. Trust me~ I've been there~ specifically on that rappel. And these twist are super strong and makes it nearly impossible to pull the ropes. Kind of like a prussic with 10 or 20 wraps. Nothing to do with new ropes~ etc. To prevent~ just keep tension in the tag line once the last person raps to avoid this. Rope creep with different diameter ropes? No problem. Clip into both ropes for the rappel as normal. Add an additional biner to the skinny rope to increase friction on it. Works well. Have the second rappeller waiting at the achor watch for rope creep~ and grab it if necessary to stop it. Then~ when the second raps~ the first rapper on the ground or at next anchor can hold onto the skinny line to control rope creep. BTW~ the petit can easily be done in 5 raps. From the top~ rap to the Fixe anchors 160 down and slightly left. Then~ on the second rap~ locate the large grassy ledge 210 feet below. Rap carefully to your rope ends and down climb 10 feet of easy terrain (5.2?) to the large grassy ledge. Do the next 3 raps as normal.,Apr 2006,Jul 23 2014,1

1219,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,2,4, when pulling your ropes for the next rap I always toss or lower (as im pulling the lead) as much tag line as possible.  We found that usually ends up being half or more of the tag line.  Then you thread and toss your lead line...having tied off your tag on a bight beforehand so you don't lose is after lowering the majority and pulling yr ropes overhead.  This method guarantees that not only will your ropes not wrap each other up when tossing~ but (more importantly) keeps the skinny tag from snarling itself something fierce when you try to toss the full 60m at once.  Also~ whenever tossing any amount of tag always feed out a solid 40 feet of tail off the coil...keeps that tails from threading loops on the way down.

Anything smaller than an 8mm is pretty squirrelly though and must be constantly monitored.

Yet you quote him~ hmm.  So he made you think.  Does that equate to a fact.   If you have a link to a situation where someone burned through their rap line while rapping~ that would be useful.  Instead~ you cite a situation where the system failed~ then the rope zipped through the rings at an extremely fast rate~ generating tremendous heat.  Nothing like rappelling heat.

1259,Rapping with a tagline - tips?,4,4, Same thing just happened to us yesterday. It absolutely baffled us. Fortunately~ it was a brand new tag line and so my main goal was to tag it behind while climbing to get the rope flaked properly. The rappel route was odd enough for serious potential of ropes getting stuck on the pull and the rap stations were 35m apart so we ended up deciding not to rap off the tag line until the last rappel. But when we got to the ground and pulled the tag line~ all these twists formed in the rope to an extent that two of us could not get the lead rope to move. I am still perplexed by what happened but I’m now guessing that there must have been hidden twists in the tag line from it being on a coil and being brand new. ,Aug 2017,Jul 3 2020,0
1260,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,0, I saw someone using a Purcell prusik as a pas the other day and quite liked the idea. Made me think of the dyneema whoopee slings I made for my hammock. Has anyone tried using one as an adjustable pas? Is it too finicky to quickly adjust? I personally have no qualms regarding their strength - dyneema is strong shit (I've got some 4mm SK78 Marlow d12 laying around that I was thinking of using~ min/avg breakload 1850kg/2060kg) and I've worked doing rigging on yachts so my splicing is up to snuff. But please weigh in if you think I'm gonna die :-),Aug 2019,Jul 2 2020,0
1261,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,1, I’ve played with it over the years~ and not found it worthwhile and takes 2 hands to lengthen.,Jun 2019,Jul 2 2020,1
1262,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,2," I’ve played with it over the years~ and not found it worthwhile and takes 2 hands to lengthen. Damn that's a small bury!. It would make sense that vectran would work better but alas all I have is the 4mm dyneema which is super slippery especially with the coating it has. Why would you purposefully design yours to slip at 5kn? Did you have a knot in the end to stop it pulling through or an eye to attach back to a biner/tie in loops to make it a ""closed"" system? (Actually now that I say this~ did you lark hitch that eye on the fixed end directly to your tie in loops or have it on a locker? Was chafe an issue?)",Aug 2019,Jul 3 2020,0
1263,Whoopee Sling PAS,1,3, Yup~ a very short bury~ and intentional.  These things hold by friction~ and reducing the bury reduces the friction~ thereby allowing you to get it to slip at a known force.  It was remarkably consistent too.  There is a butt splice on the end~ and found that the larger diameter would not pull through when loaded.  Had done others with a loop on the end that would be clipped to the loaded loop as well.  This was all part of digging into using them as reusable textile screamers~ and combining several into a self-equalizing~ load limiting anchor.  Worked quite well in slow pull tests~ but never got around to drop tests and no longer have multiple strain gage indicators~ so can’t do multipoint force measurement and won’t be revisiting it. Anyway~ I found it to work in dyneema too and only showed vectran as I knew where that one was.  Bury needs to be longer with dyneema due to how slippery it is.  I tried pobon and technora as well~ and did not like how they behaved.  The vectran and dyneema got a bit fuzzy after 20 or so pulls~ but still slipped at the expected force.  Seems I did not post a chart of it in the other post~ but did share a page of my notes:  mountainproject.com/forum/t… But as for using Whoopi slings in general~ arborists do it all the time~ so likely safe.,Jun 2019,Jul 3 2020,0
1264,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,0, I'm spending a bunch of time there later this summer. I'll be doing a lot of long approaches in scree fields~ boulder fields~ bushwhacking~ etc. Ideally they could handle long dusty approaches~ some stream crossings~ and lengthy class 3 and 4 routes. Previously I would have just wore trail runners and then switched to a rock climbing shoe~ but if I could get the benefits of both in one pair of shoes~ that'd be ideal. Any suggestions? I've had the La Sportiva TX3 recommended. Sort of difficult to shop for shoes right now because retail hasn't opened up yet.,May 2020,May 24 2020,0
1265,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,1, I'd go with the tx4s over the 3 if you want them to last with heavy shwacking and scree field use. Same shoe~ just with a leather upper that's more durable than the mesh. Youll probably want to take them off for submerged stream crossings though,May 2017,May 24 2020,3
1266,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,2, Any approach shoe will be fine. I think it's important to prioritize qualities in a shoe~ i.e.~ what's important to you. For me~ here are the priorities in descending order:,Nov 2009,May 24 2020,2
1267,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,3, Depending of what fit you best I would either go for la sportiva tx4 or scarpa mescalito (my choice),Dec 2019,May 24 2020,0
1268,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,4, Incoming waterproof vs. breathable shoes debate,Feb 2020,May 24 2020,4
1269,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,5, I vote TX3. The approaches in the Sierra are generally hot and sunny~ and the leather upper of the TX4 doesn't breathe as well as the mesh on the TX3. Also~ the mesh TX3 dries a lot quicker than the leather TX4. TX3 is lighter too. I'm not a fan of waterproof shoes~ which usually keep more moisture in than they keep out when it comes to summer mountaineering. The TX4 does have the advantage of durability for skiing scree or actual climbing~ but I'd still go with the TX3~ which will easily last a summer full of Sierra adventures. I find the TX series very comfortable~ even with a big pack~ and it climbs quite well if it comes to that. With the laces loosened~ it's a nice camp slipper too. Great shoes~ I'm on my third pair.,Nov 2004,May 24 2020,8
1270,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,6, I agree on non-waterproof shoes. Sierras were pretty damn dry this Winter anyways. By late Summer you could easily avoid getting your feet wet~ even at high elevations~ with non-waterproof shoes.,Feb 2020,May 24 2020,0
1271,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,7," I do exactly this in 20-year-old New Balance lightweight (but not ""ultralight"") running shoes. ""Waterproofness"" is not only unnecessary but likely counterproductive.",May 2011,May 24 2020,4
1272,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,8, Interesting comments on waterproofness. Those were my priorities.  If that isn't important to you~ there's no debate from me! I haven't had a problem with retaining moisture or overheating because of waterproof shoes. Note that I gave specific conditions (wet!) where I'd use them. I don't even have any waterproof approach shoes~ but I do have some hiking shoes that are. And they only provide limited protection from water. Not sure this digression helps the OP. Here are some reviews on approach shoes:https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/climbing/best-approach-shoes,Nov 2009,May 24 2020,0
1273,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,9, Plenty of high Sierra approaches in scarpa gecko (big fan) and the scarpa crux (midsole wore out too much for my liking).  Have Some friends who have enjoyed the tx3.  If dealing with lots a scree~ might be worth getting a mid shoe or maybe some light gaiters? Eh~ stuff fills your shoes regardless~ never mind.  If I expect any technical scramble~ like high Sierra class 3/4~ I love the Gecko. Not awesome for anything over a 5-7 mile approach but I’ve definitely done it. I don’t really consider waterproof for most approach shoes I own~ if the weather turns then I’m outta there u less it’s a much longer in trip. In such case I’m probably wearing a light boot anyway. Water crossings~ barefoot. ,Aug 2013,May 24 2020,0
1274,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,10, The best show is usually the one that fits your foot the best. Wide or narrow forefoot~ heel~ toe box~ etc. try a bunch and buy the pair that fits your foot the best. ,Oct 2011,May 24 2020,2
1275,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,11, Done a bunch of E Sierra and W Sierra approaches in Guide Tennies. I've had them for 3 years and just got them resoled a month ago~ pretty sure they'll last a while longer too. Super comfy~ like foot pillows. Only downside I'd say is that I think they're heavier than other approach shoes,Sep 2017,May 24 2020,1
1276,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,12," Hey everyone~ thanks for all the advice. Lots to think about. It'll be difficult to try them all on right now. I'm expecting to demolish the things over the summer~ so as long as they last that long I""ll be happy (and I may be taking off a month in September to dirt bag it~ we'll see). The XT3 and XT4 are the top contenders at the moment; a buddy of mine swore by his the other day. What's up with the XT2s?",May 2020,May 24 2020,0
1277,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,13, I haven't been to the Eastern Sierra~ but after using La Sportiva TX3 very heavily for 3-4 months (mostly in Red Rocks and on nearby limestone)~ the sole is beginning to fall off and there's a couple small holes in the upper mesh. Overall I love the TX3. They're comfortable~ especially with the wide box toe~ and climb well on low class 5. I'm somewhat disappointed that they're falling apart~ but I've put them through the ringer. I should be able to get another few weeks out of them though. I ordered a new pair of TX4~ so hoping those are more durable (no holes like in the TX3 mesh). I suspect the Eastern Sierra has more rugged terrain than Red Rocks though..,Oct 2018,May 24 2020,0
1278,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,14, They're lighter~ more minimal~ less support~ little midsole cush~ more pliable/less wear resistant upper.  Great to pack with you on your harness for walk offs. I wouldn't wanna do a thru hike in them. If there's something you wanna actually climb that you want to have a bit more sensitivity~ or has a crack you wanna squirm your foot in~ they can be handy.  They excel at smearing and smedging. Can't edge. One of my favorite all-day climbing/scrambling shoes for the easy routes here in the Flatirons. Feels like cheating when compared to other approach shoes. Can be resoled.,Jan 2014,May 24 2020,1
1279,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,15, Incoming waterproof vs. breathable shoes debate The only time I've found shoes w/Goretex worth it is when the temp is below 0 (so winter~ snow). I've backpacked for weeks in Alaska  in summertime (read: a f'n swamp) in LS Mutants and I wouldn't want to have had a GTX shoe on me. The shoe gets wet~ your feet get wet. It's just what's inevitable. If you submerge any shoe~ the interior is gunna get wet.  When that happens~ do you want waterproof or breathable when you want to get water OUT of the shoe?,Jan 2014,May 24 2020,0
1280,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,16, It might be worth looking at the TX Guides. They've got a lug sole for hiking and sticky rubber in the front for climbing. I've gone for runs up to 10 miles and climbed mid 10s in them. So far they've been treating me well. We'll see how they do after a couple of months in a mining camp. They're not waterproof~ but they're more water resistant than the mesh shoes are.,May 2016,May 24 2020,0
1281,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,17, I dig the TX3~ they’re pretty durable as well as technical~ decent edging. If you’re going for waterproof you’d probably need boots and/or gaiters but I really do a minimum of snow approaches. From trail running~ I learned I’d rather have wet feet because running shoes really aren’t keeping out moisture with the low profile and you sweat anyway~ but I’m speaking more in terms of running in the rain which you probably wouldn’t be doing.,Sep 2005,May 24 2020,0
1282,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,18, I like the Garmont Dragontail MNT better than the TX4 and TX3 as they've got stiffer sole and more support~ especially on multiday outings.  The MNT are more comparable to the TX Guide.  TX3 are fine for trail dayhikes~ but not durable enough for my tastes off trail.   The Dragontail are available with or without Goretex~ and if you want a higher ankle cut they make the Vetta version.,Jun 2017,May 26 2020,0
1283,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,19, Well~ it looks like retail is opening up in Cali again~ so I may actually get a chance to try on some of these shoes soon. TX3 seems like the popular choice (also my buddy's choice)~ but I have weird feet so I'm going to try on the other recs. The Garmont is an interesting mix; it looks sturdy for sure. Someone needs to come out with an approach shoe that can take a crampon. That'd be sick. EDIT: Apparently it can be done~ poorly.,May 2020,May 26 2020,0
1284,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,1,20, I'd have no concerns using the Dragontail MNT with full strap crampons~ they might even be OK with hybrid style bindings.,Jun 2017,May 26 2020,0
1285,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,0," I very much like the TX4 low and mid~ and appreciate the sacrifice in breathability for the more durable leather uppers~ especially since I do some scrambling in them. I quit guide tennies cold turkey once I'd had a taste of the sportivas. Side-note: I was surprised to learn that the TX4 fits differently than the TX2. One thing I didn't see mentioned is that a high/mid top can help keep scree and sand out which translates to either more comfort or less stops to dump shoes. I admittedly have never tried hiking gaiters. I've worn crampons on the TX4 gtx mids and it wasn't terrible. My main issue with 'pons and approach shoes on snow climbs is having snow accumulate between the shoe sole and 'pon~ slowly prying your toes up. Not comfy. It seems unavoidable with such a soft soled ""boot"" but I'm open to hearing if others experience this as well",Apr 2011,May 27 2020,2
1286,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,1, We use Kathtoola hiking crampons on things like trail runners all the time. Any easy snow climbs work well. ,Jan 2014,May 27 2020,1
1287,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,2, I sprung for some TX4s and I love them. Strapped on some crampons and did a lot of snow in them this past weekend with good results.  I might get a mid version someday. ,Aug 2013,Jul 1 2020,1
1288,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,3, Merrell Moabs are killer for hiking~ shwacking~ and even slabs (vibram soles~ waterproof or mesh options). I have had the 5.10 Guides and wasn't a huge fan. I currently have the leather TX2s and they are AMAZING for climbing in~ although they aren't as burly as the guides. I've lead up to 10c in them!,Aug 2017,Jul 1 2020,0
1289,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,4, For actual climbing use (op mentions class 4) I think the La Sportiva TX2/3/4 are kinda garbage. The rubber (Vibram Megagrip) is not made for real climbing~ and isn't the same stuff they use on their climbing shoes. Don't get me wrong I love my TX2s for long approaches~ just the rubber is not very sticky. Even on a boulder hopping approach I'll feel them slip on stuff that my Guide Tennies won't. Guide Tennies on the other hand use the same sticky rubber (Stealth C4) that's used in their climbing shoes. Not as durable~ but climbs way better. If I had to solo up some slab~ hands down I'm taking my Guide Tennies over my TX2s. I'm not familiar with the other shoes mentioned in the thread~ but if they're not using the same rubber as a climbing shoe~ they're gonna be sub-par for climbing.,Aug 2012,Jul 1 2020,1
1290,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,5," There's many a flatiron slabmonger that would disagree with you. Coming from the Guide Tennies (the older~ ""good"" ones)~ moving to a pair of TX2's felt like cheating. You wouldn't even want climbing rubber on an approach shoe - it would wear out too fast (so I wouldn't expect it). What you're comparing is any other running or hiking shoe - compare Megagrip to any of the FriXion compounds: world's different. With Megagrip~ you gain stickiness~ you lose durability. Keep going to climbing shoe rubber~ and you lose even more durability~ as well as performance on wet surfaces. Whatever the dot rubber that 5.10 uses on its approach shoe~ it's pretty similar to Megagrip. (TX2 is just a better fitting shoe for me)",Jan 2014,Jul 1 2020,0
1291,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,6," You've been had by marketing - it's ""Stealth"" (which is meaningless)~ but it's not C4.",Jan 2014,Jul 1 2020,0
1292,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,7, I disagree with this pretty hard. I think my guide tennies are awful in comparison to my TX3s. I have been able to comfortably climb 5.11/v3 in my TX3s and haven't had any issue with them slipping while smearing or scrambling easy 4th and 5th class. The guide tennies have less support~ feel worse when hiking~ and have less sensitivity when climbing imo. I honestly do not enjoy wearing my guide tennies at all. ,Mar 2014,Jul 1 2020,1
1293,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,8, Guide Tennies are great for Sierra granite~ but the soles delaminate quite fast~ especially if you are jamming them on cracks a lot. Does anyone know why the high top version has been discontinued?,May 2014,Jul 1 2020,1
1294,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,9," You've been had by marketing - it's ""Stealth"" (which is meaningless)~ but it's not C4. That link says C4 is used on Guide Tennies. Uh oh!",Nov 2009,Jul 1 2020,2
1295,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,10," That link says C4 is used on Guide Tennies. Uh oh! It's C4 fer sher. They have other ""Stealth"" rubbers (eg Stealth Onyxx) but they do use C4 in the Tennies. Some argue that the Stealth recipes changed when Adidas bought them~ but that's a different topic. The argument about durability is valid (Megagrip is going to last longer than C4) but there's a reason Megagrip isn't used in climbing shoes and C4 is. One is objectively stickier. The C4 rubber (and tennie sole design) is also not great in dirt~ so there's definitely a compromise being made for stickiness vs durability and 'all around' functionality.",Aug 2012,Jul 1 2020,1
1296,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,11, It doesn't pass a sniff test though. The Megagrip on the TX is certainly not like any of the other Vibram climbing rubber. I can certainly tell the difference climbing say: the First Flatiron in TX2's when compared to TC Pro's (shod with XS Edge). The TC's feel way stickier. Now think of what people resole TC's with - is it more XS Edge~ or do a large amount of people prefer C4? C4 has a rep. of being stickier than at least XS Edge. Now go back to comparing a 5.10 tennie to a TX3. Feel pretty similar back on the First Flatiron. You're saying the C4 I just resoled my TC Pro's with is the same C4 on the 5.10 Tennie? Okay. I get it~ it's hard to prove~ since I currently can't get a sheet of Dot Rubber or C4 from 5.10 and compare using~ Science!  But the use case for an approach shoe and a climbing shoe is different - why would one ever use the same rubber? Better life/performance using a different rubber compound for each use case. Any stories of getting an approach shoe resoled with C4 Stealth? (NOT Dot Rubber)? I would if they'd let me~ but my feeling is that it would be a lot more expensive. If it's the same compound for the approach shoe rubber~ why is it cheaper to resole in comparison?,Jan 2014,Jul 1 2020,0
1297,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,12, Hard to believe~ I can tell. You're paying the same price for TX3s and Tennies but one comes with a big slab of C4 climbing rubber?!?! Either there's a conspiracy and the manufacturer and all the testers are lying to you~ or...,Aug 2012,Jul 1 2020,1
1298,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,13, Hard to believe~ I can tell. You're paying the same price for TX3s and Tennies but one comes with a big slab of C4 climbing rubber?!?!  Either there's a conspiracy and the manufacturer and all the testers are lying to you~ or... Weak-sauce Sportiva shoelaces aside~ I'm pretty happy with the durability of the TX2 - they're durable enough to take a resole after 2 years of use. Are they the most durable approach shoe in the world? Not by a country mile. But there's the TX3~ TX4~ etc that are much more durable if that's what you want. I didn't have bad durability issues with the old 5.10 tennie~ but the TX2 just fits better for climbin'~ as it's a much more low profile~ sensitive shoe. ,Jan 2014,Jul 1 2020,0
1299,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,14, When I use to work at the Yosemite Mountaineering School~ it wasn’t uncommon to see other guides get approach shoes resoled with C4 climbing shoe rubber.  It was usually just the front 1/3 of the shoe.  Made sense for the use case there where it wasn’t uncommon to guide 5.9/5.10 terrain in approach shoes.  I never opted for C4 as the dot tread was plenty sticky enough for me.  Though honestly I only used a couple pairs of 5.10’s as they always fell apart on me so I switched to sportivas. I did a lot of climbing in the old Exum Ridges.  Rubber was mediocre but good enough I could still do Serenity to Sons in them.   These days I have 4 different pairs in the TX line depending on the route.  Overall I haven’t been super impressed with the tx2 or tx3.  I’ve completely blown them apart in a few months.  The mesh just doesn’t seem to last for me.  I’ve had much better luck with the Tx4.  One of the best all around approach shoes I’ve ever used.  I’ve also spend a lot of time the Tx4 mids.  They aren’t amazing but pretty good when a higher top is required.,Jun 2014,Jul 2 2020,5
1300,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,15," The Sierra is full of talus crud chutes. If you're like me~ you will value durability above all else. For this reason~ I would like to take the opportunity to rag on the 5.10 guide tennies. I've blown them apart in just a few trips before. Yes they climb well~ but you can climb fun class 4 / easy 5th routes in just about anything. These days I'm rocking a PAIR OF BOOTS! The Sportiva ""TX5 GTX"" As Mikey and Long Ranger note~ the cool thing about Sportiva is there is a whole continuous spectrum of shoes available depending on how burly you need them to be. You might be able to get a flexible strap-on crampon on the TX5s although I haven't tried it. Generally if you put a crampon on an approach shoe you're gonna have a bad time.",Jul 2016,Jul 2 2020,0

1303,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,18, My go to shoe would have to be the 5.10 guide tennie. It is the most comfortable shoe I have gotten for approaches~ and hiking. I have abused it and find that it is good for about 100-150 miles of extreme use (I.E hiking the grand canyon~ class 4 approaches~ hiking across the Ut desert and on LLC approches~ ect.). The biggest downside is that this shoe is not waterproof~ so if that isn't an issue for you then I would say 100% get this shoe. ,Apr 2019,Jul 2 2020,0
1304,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,2,19, I prefer crocs.  Cheap~  good enough~ and effective prophylaxis.,Dec 2014,Jul 2 2020,2
1305,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,3,0, 1. The Tx4 would be my choice. No reason to have waterproof approach shoes for Sierra summer activities. As much as I loved 5.10 Guides for a long time the TX4 is an actual progression of the burlier side of approach shoes.  2. If you want to put strap crampons on them for snow field romping it'll definitely work. The best strap crampons right now are the dynemma cable'd Petzl crampons for when you actually needs crampons (Camp also has similar dynemma linked ones). Having that flexible underfoot connection makes them so much more secure underfoot and less sketchy feeling than rigid bar strap crampons. My preference is the Irvis Hybrid so you still have the steel front and the lightweight-ness of the dynemma cable and alum rear. And they also make awesome lightweight full auto crampons for ski mountaineering.  ,Oct 2011,Jul 2 2020,2
1306,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,3,1, Been rocking the grocery outlet flip flops lately! They’re a dollar each and get me to the base of most routes no problem! Almost blew through my first pair after 7 months of approaches in them. Already picked up a second pair though~ the price did increase~ they’re now $2 each foot,Aug 2016,Jul 2 2020,1
1307,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,3,2, Really like(d) the fit and feel of my TX3s~ but kinda unimpressed with the durability -- I've worn them for around eight months and there are holes in the mesh on both shoes and the tread/soles are almost totally destroyed. I wouldn't say I've babied the shoes~ but I wouldn't say I've 100 percent put them through the wringer either ... Maybe that's all I can expect from a $130 retail shoe in 2020?,Oct 2016,Jul 2 2020,0

1310,Best approach shoes for Eastern Sierra,3,5, I m afraid that s the price you have to pay for a lightweight version.  If it's like the TX2 you end up with a hole in the mesh on the outside of your foot right around where the widest part of your foot is. I've had luck extending the life of the shoe a lot with some superglue though~ it bonds the mesh back together and holds well. I think my next pair of TX2s are going to get pre-emptive superglue both on the thin rubber at the toe~ and on the mesh on the sides where they wear out.,Aug 2012,Jul 2 2020,2

1315,Rappeling off an older rope,1,0, Looking for an honest opinion from those smarter and better then me at this. I have been out of climbing for a couple of years due to my job but soon will be able to start again. Almost all of my nylon/non-metal gear has aged out and I have replaced it as one should. My question is this: I have a 9 year old rope that I have replaced (as my primary climbing rope). This older rope has some signs of usage but no major damage (no flattening~ cuts~ excessive fuzz~ major discoloration ect...). It has been stored in a rope bag and although moved around a lot~ kept in a dry container. What are everyone's thoughts on using this rope as the other rope in a double rope rappel? The person who taught me how to climb thinks it's not a problem since it won't really be dynamically loaded and shows no damage. In a ideal world I would just buy another $220 rope but these things aren't cheap. Thanks for your insight.,Jun 2020,Jul 2 2020,0

1318,Rappeling off an older rope,1,3," You have to make your own judgment about whether any particular rope is safe to lead on. However~ something to consider about bringing a rope you wouldn't lead on is that you are giving up some of the advantage of having two ropes (i.e. having a backup in case of rock-fall~ rope-stuck~ swinging leads in a party of three~ etc). Another thing to consider is if you wouldn't lead on it~ maybe you shouldn't rescue with it either (i.e. haul a human using mechanical advantage)~ or loan it out to someone who might lead on it. None of those things are disqualifying~ just worthy (IMO) of consideration.   I think they are probably immaterial in a single-pitch TR situation~ which is why I think of my ropes as ""fine"" or ""TR only"" but I don't keep any in the category of ""rap only"" (other than special-purpose rap cords~ which are obviously a different thing...).",Jul 2013,Jul 2 2020,1
1319,Rappeling off an older rope,1,4, Just as a reference point:  had a 20 yr old rope (11mm Mammut) that had been used hard and beat to shit~ held lead falls~ etc.  retired it and used it for lead fall tests (lost track of how many).  then roofing and general purpose rope use~ stored carelessly (sometimes on garage floor) then at 25 yrs old re-tested with 5x FF1 lead falls...all held.    I finally said “Fuck it~ this rope won’t die” and went back to leading on it again.  (J/k),Jun 2013,Jul 2 2020,8

1321,Rappeling off an older rope,1,6, Was using a 20 year old rope just a few days ago for some toproping on the seaside cliffs. The time to retire the cord maybe when you have problems rapelling because the sheath and core move at a different rate which causes the sheath to bunch up around the core(which was happening). I'd still whip all over that rope though~ it just made rappelling a bit sketchy.,Mar 2006,Jul 2 2020,2
1322,Rappeling off an older rope,1,7, I will keep using an aged but good condition rope until it gets in my head.  As soon as I realize I’m “thinking about” wether the rope is solid~ I weave it into a floor mat.  You are probably good to go with your description.  Body weight only loads~ even with bouncing around~ are pretty low.  ,Apr 2020,Jul 2 2020,0

1331,Rappeling off an older rope,1,16, Thanks~ Brandon. OK~ I see now that~ in his worst case scenario~ he is talking about what he calls “permanent top ropes” like what you might find hanging in a gym. I did notice~ though~ that the machine he built to simulate cycling a top rope through an anchor carabiner only used a very short section of rope (maybe one meter?) and was constantly weighted to 80kg. I’m thinking this kind of abuse would not be so narrowly focused in real life—that is~ it would be spread throughout much of the rope length. Still~ his surprising results are worth some consideration... I’ll probably retire my very well-used gym rope just in case. Another interesting point: the huge difference (to the better) with what I think is unicore technology in the durability of the rope in these kinds of “permanent top rope” scenarios. Maybe it’s thread drift~ but I’d love to hear what other experienced testers think.,Nov 2015,Jul 2 2020,0

1333,Rappeling off an older rope,1,18, I've seen tests of old nylon. It's still very strong. I'm not concerned at all about rapping on a 9 year old rope (if stored properly). I also use 9 year old ropes for top roping. Lead climbing is different because it's not just strength~ it's elasticity you want to safely catch a lead fall. Elasticity lessens over time~ so I wouldn't lead on 9 year old rope normally~ but in an emergency (main lead line got chopped) I'd do it if needed. ,Oct 2011,Jul 2 2020,0

1337,Rappeling off an older rope,2,1, A lead rope isn't worn out when it might break~ it's worn out when it's stiff~ won't absorb impact. An undamaged rope is toast for leading long before it will break under factor two falls. But if you take a factor two fall on a rope which is on its way to becoming static? I took a lead fall on a vertical route in Josh - a bit longish but protected by a bolt - climbing on a perfectly good looking~ but played out rope. The sprained back took me out of the game for three months. That was no where near factor two~ I was fifty feet above my belayer and fell about 15.,Apr 2004,Jul 2 2020,3

1340,Grigri+ malfunction,1,0, My 2 year old grigri+ has malfunctioned a couple of times in the past months. When rappelling with it~ it feels as if the anti-panic function is engaged and I have to pull the lever back all the way to lower. I can't un-engage the anti-panic function. This first happened a couple of months ago~ and after taking the grigri off of the rope~ opening and inspecting it~ then reinstalling it onto the rope~ it worked fine. It happened again yesterday and I've been unable to get it to work properly since. Already contacted Petzl and waiting for a reply. Anyone else experienced something similar?,Dec 2011,Jun 29 2020,1

1350,Flatiron Shoes,1,2, You'll find a spectrum of what people like to use. I personally usually use a pair of trail runners~ and a pair of tightly fitting approach shoes - I like the trailrunners because I do a lot of running before/after; a like the fit of the approach shoes for better performance. I'm not sure if there's One True Shoe~ really - just compromises. If you get minimal with the approach shoe~ the rest of the hike won't be as comfortable. ,Jan 2014,Jul 2 2020,0
1351,Flatiron Shoes,1,3, Just got the Sportiva TC Guides and have really liked them for both the run and the scramble (as opposed to the other TX models~ which miss the mark). They're head-and-shoulders better than the (embarrassingly high number) of other approach/scrambling shoes I have. Most of the serious folks I know resole slightly tight running shoes with sticky rubber. 5.10~ Scarpa~ and now BD also make approach shoes (maybe Adidas too?)--get ones with the most amount of forefoot and heel padding for running the approach/descent. ,Jan 2006,Jul 2 2020,0

They tend to last me for about 100-120 miles per pair before needing to be replaced and they are a little cheaper (like $90-100 if I remember right) than some other approach shoes. The biggest down side is they aren't super water proof - or water proof like at all. ,Apr 2019,Jul 2 2020,0
1355,Are black totems easier to get stuck?,1,0, Something I like about the black diamonds (and to some extent mastercams) is the ability to manipulate individual lobes with a nut tool to get a stuck piece out. This has led to some pretty good booty so far. I'm thinking about replacing my trusty blue #1 mastercams with the black totem~ particularly since I've enjoyed the single set of larger sizes. I did run into a nearly new black totem that was stuck in a crack~ and I even went back to spend a second 20 minutes on it the next morning. I had zero luck getting any of the lobes to move and it seemed part of it was having zero space to move the lobes~ since the totem heads are a mess of thick wires. 1) Does anyone have any tips for getting a stuck totem out? (The one I was talking about was 2 years ago~ so I doubt it's still there.) 2) Does anyone find that the black totem is more prone to getting stuck? (Yes I know~ place better gear. But sometimes it happens and maybe my follower is not as skilled at retrieval.),Nov 2012,Jun 29 2020,0
1356,Are black totems easier to get stuck?,1,1, I havn't had issues~ but it's likely because you learn to place totems differently than SLCDs~ you shouldnt be overcamming them to the point where you would be with other cams.,Mar 2015,Jun 30 2020,0

1360,Are black totems easier to get stuck?,1,5, Totems feel like they bite the rock better and it. an be a little harder to manipulate them because of a lack of rigid stem (the lack of which is their biggest strength) but the biggest contributor to totems getting stuck is likely to be inexperience with them. The shape of totem lobes is different than other cams and consequently what the lobes look like when completely cammed looks different than other cams. If you try to place totems where the lobes visually look like other cams you are more likely to get them stuck. Picture below shows side by side comparison between a fully cammed totem and a fully cammed C4 (larger size used for visual but applies to all sizes),Aug 2018,Jul 1 2020,7
1361,Are black totems easier to get stuck?,1,6, I think there's something to Ryan's theory -- the squared off lobes hit more crystals/deformations in some circumstances~ and the flex in the stem makes them a little harder to micro wiggle. As others have said~ Totems are usually easier to get out but when they're stuck they tend to be really really stuck. I think part of this is due to how easy it is to fully retract the cam lobes - this is a good thing and usually makes them easier to get out~ but when they're super stuck you don't have an extra couple mm to work with / force via a nut tool. I've bootied a couple of smaller totems now including a yellow that was surprisingly hard to remove from what looked like a straightforward jammed placement (I don't think a bd would have gotten stuck in the same way)~ plus I've failed on a green that just wouldn't budge.,Mar 2014,Jul 1 2020,0

1366,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,0, Good morning I am a fairly new sport climber with a question about belaying from the top. There are a few wonderful routes at the Obed in TN that have a wonderful view at the top and a really nice ledge to stand on while cleaning and such.  I am wanting to start learning multi pitch SPORT climbing by working on bringing up a second on a single pitch. Not ready for trad yet. Belaying from the top seems pretty intuitive but I want to be damn sure I am ready for all the strange occurrences that can happen.  Building anchors are so very case dependent~ and I don’t really want to discuss them hear (but the quad anchor is what I will most likely build).  QUESTION: lowering a climbing from above. I have seen many different and fairly complicated methods. The DMM pivot seems to make things very streamlined. Is this really as simple and SAFE as it seems?https://vimeo.com/101652072 ​Thanks!!,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0
1367,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,1, If your goal is to practice for multipitch~ I’d recommend rappelling the route instead of lowering the second. Lowering another climber is something I almost never do on multipitch routes but transitioning from your anchor to a rappel is pretty common.,Apr 2017,Jun 21 2020,21
1368,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,2," I'd be hesitant to use guide mode when belaying from above on a typical Obed roof (as a ""fairly new sport climber""). What's your plan if your 2nd falls in the roof?",Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,7
1369,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,3, That is the whole point of my question. It looks like the DMM pivot makes lowering pretty simple. It does not appear that I need to rig up slings to flip the ATC. I would still think a prusik on my end would be needed however. ,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2
1370,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,4, Good point. I am very comfortable with that (I was an arborist for 9 years~ self belaying and rigging was done on the daily).,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0

I'd still be hesitant (depending on the route) as it's an extra complication and sometimes communication can be tricky around a roof or bulge.,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,12
1372,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,6,  I have considered that for sure. I could then use a grigri. My concern with that was:,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,2
1373,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,7, The biggest factors for me in deciding how I am going to belay from the top are # 1. partners competence and secondly but still very important~ anchor location in relation to belay stance. Super helpful to situate the master point above you when belaying in guide mode and always important to reduce friction as much as you can in guide mode. Taking up slack can be a bit nuanced when in guide mode~ I like to have a hand occasionally  on the climbers strand to monitor the slack situation.Overhangs and belays back from the edge are good candidates for not using guide mode in most cases.,Oct 2010,Jun 21 2020,1
1374,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,8, I use a grigri to belay from the top 99% of the time for both sport and trad multipitch. It’s SO simple and worth the money. Slap it onto your anchor and pull the rope. Lowering is easy as well as you redirect the brake-strand rope and  pull the lever. Otherwise~ I belay with an ATC from my harness and redirect the rope. However~ if you’re getting into multipitch~ I would bring your second up then rappel down rather than lowering. It’s also nice to just get your second up and sit on the cliffside together. That’s the best part of climbing taller stuff.,Oct 2018,Jun 21 2020,14
1375,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,9, You might want to edit your comment to mention that you need to redirect the brake strand before lowering. You don’t *just* pull the lever. ,Nov 2017,Jun 21 2020,5
1376,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,10, Put your gri gri on the anchor to belay. Be aware that the camming action could be compromised if the device gets jammed against the rock by the weight of a climber on the rope. If you need to lower~ it is much easier. I'd still recommend a friction knot on the brake side of the rope just in case~ or a big stopper knot tied in the brake side a few feet away.,Nov 2014,Jun 21 2020,5

Make sure the masterpoint of the anchor is far enough away from the wall so that it doesn’t have the opportunity to jam.

My concern with that was: Clip the gri-gri to the anchor~ don't fuss around with a re-direct. Test the action on the cam to make sure there are no obstacles trapping it shut. Now you're good to go.,Mar 2014,Jun 21 2020,4
1382,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,1,16, I have considered that for sure. I could then use a grigri. My concern with that was: If it's a modern bolted anchor I wouldn't consider 1 to be a serious concern (really I wouldn't stress about it on almost any anchor except for some kind of sketchy tied off rhodo nest). And personally I don't stress about 2. that much. Plus~ as it's a single pitch climb you are talking about~ you can just lower off the second and consider the belay effectively escaped. For 3~ I wouldn't worry too much either unless the difference is really dramatic. Especially if a roof is in play~ the friction on the rope is going to add a lot of resistance. But if it is a concern~ you can just hang the GriGri on the anchor directly~ as others have alluded to (I don't use a GriGri often so I won't presume to speak to nuances with that method).,Jan 2020,Jun 21 2020,1

1389,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,2, If you are belaying directly off the anchor with a grigri~ or Atc type in guide mode~ you do not need to be able to escape the belay~ because you are not directly attached to it.,Nov 2008,Jun 21 2020,0
1390,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,3, You're not going to be belaying from the top on any of the Obed roof climbs. Probably more likely best seat~ spawn~ or something similar. I'd use a grigri off the anchor to belay that way. ,Jan 2016,Jun 21 2020,1
1391,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,4, That is the whole point of my question. It looks like the DMM pivot makes lowering pretty simple. It does not appear that I need to rig up slings to flip the ATC. I would still think a prusik on my end would be needed however.  Just do a weighted LSD lower~ I’ll find you a video,Aug 2019,Jun 21 2020,1

1393,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,6, Right~ my original question was about lowering a climber should something happen. ,Nov 2019,Jun 21 2020,0
1394,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,7," Lowering a climber from above with a plaquette-style device in plaquette mode (aka ""something like the Pivot"") is always a horror show~ and these devices have well-documented catastrophic failure criteria that are difficult to understand and conceptualize. Read this as: ""There's a good chance you'll do something minor that immediately turns the device into a pulley and kills your friend."" While it can certainly be done somewhat safely by a person with training~ know-how~ practice~ and a prusik backup~ the majority of folks just avoid it in favor of other techniques --- especially because even when you do it ""safely~"" it doesn't end up being particularly smooth at all. I exclusively use a redirected GRIGRI for this application: petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Lower…  Again~ it can be done. But since you asked...don't do it",Nov 2017,Jun 22 2020,11
1395,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,8," Right~ my original question was about lowering a climber should something happen.  Lowering a climber with a grigri in ""guide mode"" is exactly the same as lowering a climber with a grigri not in guide mode. Alternatively~ you belay off your harness with a redirect through the anchor~ and save yourself the trouble of it all. ",Jan 2016,Jun 29 2020,1
1396,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,9, In thousands of climbs I've lowered a climber to rework a move~ or get to a good starting point after a fall~ many times. I've never needed to lower a climber to the bottom of a pitch and never needed to escape the belay. Although it's good to have a plan in mind if things go wrong~ you should setup your system towards the most likely scenarios. Guide mode is an advanced use of the device. IMO you should learn and master the normal way to belay from your waist with a redirect before considering guide mode. Lowering in guide mode is more complex and risky. If you feel you must use guide mode~ as mentioned use a grigri. Almost doubling to force on an anchor for top roping (basically what's happening with a redirect to the second) is not a problem. When you lead you if you take a lead fall you could take a high fall factor fall onto a single piece with the almost doubling~ and it's within the limits of the system. For a correctly built multipiece anchor with top rope falls~ it's a non issue. Escaping the belay is extremely rare. In most cases as a beginner you are better off calling for a rescue and letting the professionals help~ instead of trying to escape the belay and making things worse. As mentioned just lower your partner to the ground. If your partner is heavier than you place a piece by your feet~ with a tether to your belay loop~ that holds you down. You will need to learn this skill for belaying a leader that's heavier than you anyway. Learn and practice the basics before moving on to more advanced techniques.,Oct 2011,Jun 29 2020,1
1397,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,10," Lowering a climber with a grigri in ""guide mode"" is exactly the same as lowering a climber with a grigri not in guide mode. No it's not~ don't spread this dangerous misinformation. The friction over the lip~ which is hard to maintain with the device pointing down~ is a key part of the GriGri's function. To get this back~ you need a redirect~ see here or here. Note how in the second video she's using a carabiner made by Petzl specifically for this purpose.

1400,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,13, Here's a video on belaying from the top with a Grigri:youtube.com/watch?v=F_f61vU…  As mentioned earlier in this thread~ you don't need a fancy and expensive Freino biner. Any properly sized and positioned re-direct is sufficient. I promise that once you go to Grigri for top belay and multi-pitch~ you'll never go back. It gives so much less friction compared to a plate device in guide mode~ which means it's waaay less tiring to pull in rope. In terms of pure energy expenditure~ the efficiency gained here totally offsets the weight of the device. And that's before even considering the functional benefits of lowering a follower~ setting up a haul~ belaying a leader with assisted braking~ etc. I used to think the Grigri was only for single pitch sport climbing~ but now I've seen the light and I'm a believer. ,Aug 2014,Jun 29 2020,4

1402,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,2,15," In a scenario with multipitch routes over big roofs~ especially if there is any traversing angle to the route~ a very useful thing is for the second to have a microascender or prussik and know how to ascend the rope.  You can't alway guarantee that a lower will bring your second back to the lower belay station~ esp since they have removed gear between the lower anchor and themselves. They could end up in space or having to pendulum sideways to reach the anchor again.   If you are lowering them to the the ground~ yes~ you can usually lower them to the ground~ but even this is not always guaranteed~ routes that start on ledges with ground falling away from one side or the other is one scenario where a lower to the ""ground"" can still end with the second in a dicey situation.",May 2015,Jun 29 2020,1

Obviously you should try to have the friction over the lip while using it~ but it works just fine without it.

1410,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,3, OP~ I typically belay from above with an ATC in guide mode only if there are two followers or I'm pretty damn sure my follower won't need to be lowered. In the latter case~ I still prefer a Grigri or other ABD like a Lifeguard or a Birdie. On multi-pitch~ I almost always carry both an ATC and a Grigri.

1412,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,5, I tie off with a clove hitch and a locking biner a few feet (at least an arm and a half if the climb allows) below the anchor~ and then redirect the rope from the anchor and belay them just like I would do a normal top rope belay from the bottom. My climbing partner is significantly heavier than me~ and I have never had a problem when he falls with getting sucked into the redirect.,Apr 2019,Jul 1 2020,0
1413,Newbie wanting to bring up a second,3,6, The number of people that use a redirect off the anchor for a second is somewhat shocking to me and reflects the lack of experience of the posters~ imo. This guarantees that the belayer will be pulled off their stance if a heavier climber falls below them crashing them into the anchor and potentially compromising the belay. Doubt this? Have someone surprise place 200# in your hands and see how it turns out. The way to bring up the second is either with the device on the anchor itself (GriGri or Guide Mode) or~ if using a GG or standard tube then belay off of the rope loop formed by your harness tie in and let the anchor take all the weight this way. Adjust length via cloves to let you sit comfortably at the lip to maintain vision and communication with the second and let the anchor take the weight if they fall. You are also in perfect position to lower them if you choose to get them back on the ground quickly and safely. This can be much easier than rigging a rappel keeping things nice and clean rather than having two at the belay needing to use some form of PAS to untie from the rope at what can be an awkward and crowded belay. Much easier for one to do it with his partner already out of the way. Unbelievable that so many don't know this Climbing 101 yet post like they have experience using a redirect when they really don't seem to know the consequences.,Mar 2020,Jul 1 2020,1

1441,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,1, Aside from the “just clove hitch the rope” comment~ look into the Kong slyde. It’s $10 and seems like to would work for what you are looking for. I burnt a small hole after the stopper knot and added a keychain ring. I can the clip the ring into the locker and it keeps the tail out of the way. OR you could buy a metolius pas which is lighter and can be clipped shorter.  What benefit are you getting from the Petzl product that you wouldn’t get from these cheaper and less bulky alternatives?,Feb 2009,Jul 1 2020,0
1442,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,2, Another option with the single leg connect adjust is to replace the rope with a slightly longer (and skinnier depending on usage) rope and then when two clip in points are needed just clove hitch a draw into the tail and clip in with that as well.  This is the system i've been running for a couple years now.  I replaced the rope with a piece of 8mm dynamic which obviously makes the the system a bit weaker but also a lot less bulky.  I find the trade off worth it but like all lighter and weaker gear a bit more attention needs to be paid so might not be a good fit for others. ,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,1
1443,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,3, Isn't that a special PAS? It's just that you made it. I've made one too~ and the purcell is much more difficult to adjust and has a much smaller range than the Petzl stuff. I find that it saves a lot of time getting onto rappel and lowering~ because of the easy motion and the ability to run it all the way out to get weight on the new system.

1448,Petzl Dual Connect Adjust,2,8, dindolino32~ I think using the rope is generally preferred if that is a reasonable option.  The OP doesn't explain what his use case is~ so gonna assume using the rope isn't an option or convenient (say while rappelling~ approaching a cliff from the top~ alpine climbing~ or say moving around on fixed lines).  For normal multi-pitch climbing with an easy descent (only a couple rappels) just using the rope is the way to go.   When I guided I would make clients take their PAS off unless we were gonna be rapping a lot.  I generally thought it was better to teach them how to use the rope. I've got a Kong Slyde and tried it a fair bit~ but went back to the petzl connect as it was just a smoother device to use.  I think if you don't use a PAS/tether very often and price is more of a concern the Slyde is a good alternative.  I use it for work positioning as a third arm still.  ,Jun 2014,Jul 1 2020,0

1452,Helmets in climbing,1,0, Hi folks~ I was prompted to start this thread after following a discussion about a recent climbing fatality.  See the original thread here:mountainproject.com/forum/t… In the interest of providing a place to discuss helmets that is not co-mingled with this climber's accident and death~ I offer the following space.  We can go in any direction.  For example: 1-Do you were a helmet?  Always?  Sometimes?  How do you decide? 2-Do you think helmets should offer protection principally from falling objects (rocks~ gear~ and so on)~ or do you think helmets should also provide impact protection? 3-Regarding your answers to question two above~ do you think helmets are well-designed~ or could they be improved? 4-Are the protective benefits of wearing helmets exaggerated? Could there be cases where helmets increase the chances of serious injury (There are parallel debate for cycling and skiing helmets? 5-There's been a trend toward lighter-weight soft foam helmets; good or bad? 6-Should pros be encouraged to wear helmets more often~ as a way to increase the chances that others will?   OK~ that should be enough to get started...carry on.

1457,Helmets in climbing,1,5, I'm a firm believer of wearing a helmet any time at the crag!! Better safe than sorry. I've seen rocks fall from nowhere and if I hadn't been wearing a helmet on the Crestone traverse~ I could have been seriously injured when a baseball sized rock hit my head from a rock shower.

1461,Helmets in climbing,1,9, So~ risk is personal. You cant make anyone adobt this behavior by force.  i have had a severe TBI from a fall at work. I have had friends get broken off in a varity of ways. Yes the helmet is a good tool. Its one that i use. I uselly have on with me sport climbing.  However~ the most risk is in the 1st 3 bolts~ just stick the 3rd bolt. I do~ i have had people get pissy and mock me for it.  If i outweigh my belayer (i am about 180-190 depending on training volume and diet) I always stick up high enough that i dont worry. That combined with an Ohm has made my smaller friends much happier.  It has helped me focus better.  The worst accidents i have seen were related to belayer error and device selection. I saw a cinch defeated by the carabiner. He  dropped the guy from the 8th/ 9th bolt? After taking over the scene~ lowering the paitient to the ground.  I cleared his spine and carried him out.  He broke his arm and chipped some vertebrae~  he nearly lost a finger. He was really lucky. I thought he was going to die based on how he landed and what he hit.  My good friend was dropped by an ATC pilot with an inattentive belayer and a poor carabiner interface. 11th bolt to the ground. His whole TSpine pressure fractured. I cant bealive that was it watching yhe video. It was horrific.  Lesson to learn? Use a grigri to sport climb. I dont give a fuck if you think what ever you have is just as good. I have seen that it is not 1st hand.  It makes me very aware and anxious to see others using an atc/jul/smart/whatever to sport climb.  Its not my place to tell you what to do. I do however~ asumme you are going to he dangerously incompetent untill proven otherwise.  I think any climbing helmet thay resembles a bike or skateboard helmet~ that could potentially meet the ASTM standards would be a step in the right direction. I like my siccrco from petzl alot. I even wear it sport climbing if i cant keep the rope out of my feet for a section.   ,Dec 2011,Jun 11 2020,11

1463,Helmets in climbing,1,11, I'm into helmets. The only time i dont wear it is on legit redpoint burns when it's really hot out~ on sport climbs. Otherwise~ if I'm onsighting~ or working a route~ or trad climbing~ I have it on. Also 95% of the time I'm belaying~ it's on. I think helmets with side protection are the only worthy contenders for a climbing helmet. I really like the Petzl Boreo. Very comfortable~ very light~ and some side and back protection. I do wish more pro climbers would wear them in videos~ but I'd rather see them demonstrating better belay techniques. The pros are great at inspiring some try hard~ but they rarely demonstrate good~ or great~ safety precautions that an average climber should be taking. Is that their job? Maybe~ maybe not.,Sep 2017,Jun 11 2020,0

1466,Helmets in climbing,1,14, I'm interested in the answer to this question.  (Assuming~ of course~ that the helmets are properly fitted~ worn~ and manufactured.)  ,Dec 2017,Jun 11 2020,0
1467,Helmets in climbing,1,15, I wear my helmet for the vast majority of my trad climbing~ but will take it off for routes with squeeze/OW pitches or on routes where the falls are very safe/airy. I am mostly concerned with hitting my head in a fall~ but the added protection from rockfall is useful as well. I always wear a helmet when ice climbing. I essentially never wear it for sport climbing. I think helmets like the half done and helios are borderline useless. Spend extra and get a helmet with back and side protection. ,Mar 2014,Jun 11 2020,3
1468,Helmets in climbing,1,16, Yeah~ and I also wear my seatbelt.,Jul 2018,Jun 11 2020,2
1469,Helmets in climbing,1,17, I don't wear a helmet. But helmets are good. Wear one if you want. ,Mar 2013,Jun 11 2020,3
1470,Helmets in climbing,1,18, I paid a lot for what is in my head so if there is any chance of impact or something falling I'll always wear it. Unless it is physically affecting my climbing I have never been bothered by having one on and think the benefits FAR outweigh the cost of having one extra piece of equipment you wear.,Jan 2019,Jun 11 2020,1
1471,Helmets in climbing,1,19, I pretty much always wear one when leading~ often while belaying~ not usually on TR. It would be nice if they protected against everything but not likely to happen. Falling objects and impacts would be my priorities. I recently got a new mountain bike helmet and was wondering if it is at least as good~ or maybe better~ for climbing than the climbing helmets. I also wear a helmet skiing and see no reason not to. It keeps my head warm~ and mostly cool~ better than hats~ mates up with my goggles nicely~ probably provides some protection~ and has speakers in it!,Oct 2008,Jun 11 2020,1
1472,Helmets in climbing,1,20, Hey Bill I actually looked into this Bike vs Climbing helmet thing a bit when I was buy a helmet for my daughter (basically I was like wtf I don't want to buy two freakin helmets). If I recall (?) the climbing helmets have better protection from objects falling from above than the bike helmets and bike helmets are better for side impacts. They do make helmets for kids that are rated for both BUT I would not use a bike helmet as a climbing helmet... maybe the other way around though.,Sep 2009,Jun 12 2020,0
1473,Helmets in climbing,2,0, I wear a helmet for 90% of my climbing (excluding bouldering). Occasionally I forget to put it on~ or will decide to not wear it on a wide crack. I pretty much always wear one sport climbing. Ive seen too many falling rocks~ even at popular sport areas.,Sep 2013,Jun 12 2020,4
1474,Helmets in climbing,2,1," With how light and low-profile modern helmets are~ there is absolutely no excuse for not wearing one~ at least while on the sharp end. I wear one every time I'm leading anything. It's just too easy to catch your foot on the rope or a draw or a ledge and flip~ and although most climbing helmets aren't perfect for side and rear impact~ it's better than nothing. I also climb harder in a helmet--its a subtle signal to myself to get serious and try hard. As far as wearing one on the ground for rockfall~ I do when the cliff seems unstable in some way. Typically sport climbing in an area with good rock~ I don't. Obviously risk is personal and I'll never give someone shit for not wearing a helmet while sport climbing~ although I'll talk to them about it if asked and explain why I wear one.  BUT! I think it's fucking bullshit when pros are photographed on the sharp end not wearing a helmet. They make money off of the sport~ they're leaders in the sport~ and as such~ they have an obligation to set a good~ safe example. If they are climbing on their own without photographers~ whatever~ that's their call. But if you're hauling your photo crew out to snap some shots for the mags~ and you don't wear a helmet~ you're being a fucking selfish prick and the climbing media should collectively decide not to print that photo. I don't see the other side of that argument--if you're saying shit about climbing's ""rebel spirit"" and individuality~ that doesn't address the point that someone who makes money off the sport has an obligation to set a good example.",Apr 2013,Jun 12 2020,4
1475,Helmets in climbing,2,2, I would never wear a climbing helmet on a bike.  My bike helmet is waaay thicker than my climbing helmet so should do more ti decelerate my head in a crash (the primary purpose of a bike helmet is for the foam structure to crush and allow you head a micro amount of additional time to decelerate drastically reducing g force so your brain smushes the inside of yours skull less hard) A parallel helmet question I have is MIPS?  My bike helmet has MIPS but it is bulkier than my old helmet without MIPS.  I just saw an add for a helmet (BD I think) in climbing mag with MIPS.   Do i really need the added weight and size for climbing? For those who don't know~ MIPS allows the shell of the helmet to rotate independent of your head in a crash (at least a little)  research showed that a lot of brain injuries in cycling came when you fell on your side while moving forward and your head gets jerked in a twist when it impacts.  (Or something this is from memory) Do we really have this kind of impact in climbing?  Personally didn't wear a helmet when i started climbing but now i do.  I do other helmet sports so it's easy for me to forget it's there~ I'm used to a helmet.  Also modern helmets are so nice and light.  And yes I do want it to protect me from impacts (not just falling rocks),Apr 2015,Jun 12 2020,1

1477,Helmets in climbing,2,4," Mammut Wall rider is available with MIPS (I have one). It only weighs 30g more than the non-MIPS version~ and doesn't add any noticeable bulk. It's basically a very thin web of plastic that provides isolation for the mounting points between the shell of the helmet and the ""harness"" that secures to your head.",Jul 2016,Jun 12 2020,0

1479,Helmets in climbing,2,6, Found an awesome helmet. It makes me look good.  So I always wear it. A helmet saved my brain on a bike.  Under 10mph~ a tiny stick found my front brake pad~ 1/10~000 chance. Helmet shattered~ did it's job. over before i had a clue. I'd ridden 5000 miles by then (not always with a helmet) and never known such a thing to occur before. Never ridden without one since. Have shared similar stories with other cyclists. Climbing~ my helmet could protect me from falling cams~ falling water bottles~ falling rock~ falling ice~ falling eels~ falling backwards in aiders or upside-down after catching my leg on a ledge or the rope. Life would be fucked without a sound mind.  And my helmet makes me look good.,Jan 2018,Jun 12 2020,6
1480,Helmets in climbing,2,7, It will ALWAYS be better to have it on and to not need....Than to need it for your protection and wish you hadn't left it behind. I'd be happy to show you what it looks like when you wish you had one on and did not. ,Sep 2014,Jun 12 2020,1

1482,Helmets in climbing,2,9, I consider myself a helmet skeptic~ for exactly this reason: In other words~ people with helmets make riskier decisions that mitigate (some of) their benefits.  Despite my skepticism~ I always wear a helmet while trad climbing~ almost always when sport climbing~ never when bouldering~ and never in the gym.  There are too many little things that can go wrong that can have catastrophic consequences.,Aug 2011,Jun 12 2020,0

1484,Helmets in climbing,2,11, Yes. Always when leading~ almost always when belaying now too (we have a lot of choss here in Oregon)~ and usually~ even when TRing (which is kinda overkill~ but IMHO better to stick with a habit concerning safety for muscle memory purposes). I also won't climb multipitch with anyone not wearing a helmet~ as the integrity of my partner's brain directly impacts my own safety. :),Dec 2016,Jun 12 2020,0
1485,Helmets in climbing,2,12,  It's my vague impression from reading accident reports that there are more head injuries from falls than from falling rocks~ but I would be happy to be proven wrong with actual data.  I sort of feel like people talk more about the falling rocks because they don't like to admit that they could make a mistake that would result in a head injury from falling. I wear a helmet essentially always when roped climbing~ and sometimes when bouldering.  I have never suggested that anyone else wear one~ and I think it is seriously lame to suggest that pros should do something to set an example for the rest of us.  If your choice to wear a helmet is greatly influence by what the pros do~ I'm inclined to think you should fix your decision making process in general before you worry about whether to wear a helmet.  ,Aug 2013,Jun 12 2020,5
1486,Helmets in climbing,2,13, There is a reason brands sponsor climbers (or any athletes for that matter). What atheletes do and the gear they do it in influences consumer behavior.

1487,Helmets in climbing,2,14," Avoided cracking my skull in a big slab fall because I had a helmet - I didn't usually wear one at that time~ but luckily a mentor had always said ""If you ever wear a helmet~ wear it leading slab.""  Got hit in the head with a couple small rocks - once in the Valley~ once in Owens. Both times were no big deal with the helmet on~ but the Owens one left my ears ringing from the sharp sound! Whacked my belayer straight in the head with a not-tiny flake (maybe 5 pounds from 30 feet off the belay~ flung down since I was yarding on it)~ she had a helmet on~ she was fine.  Watched a friend break a similar sized rock and nail his belayer on the hand - missed his head by inches~ no helmet~ they were 500' up a wall and the rock fell around 50 feet. Luckily the belayer heard the sound of the fall and grabbed the rope below the ATC with both hands~ since he wouldn't have been able to catch the fall otherwise (yet another argument for a Gri-Gri...). A friend who's been doing new routes ground-up for 40 years and never wears a helmet managed to whack his head on a knob just while following me (sharp Tuolumne knob~ small roof)~ bled quite a bit~ almost needed stitches. Still couldn't convince him to wear one~ but at least I got him to toss his crusty~ 30-year old harness - gave him one of mine under the condition that I watch him cut his old one up and toss it! OP questions - Always wear the helmet on lead (except tight squeeze chimneys)~ yes both impact and rockfall protection is needed~ always room for improvement in safety equipment~ protective benefits are NOT exaggerated~ can't think of a case where they'd increase injury chance (suppose you could strangle on it if you got really badly stuck in a squeeze chimney where you couldn't get your arms to the position to unclip it)~ light is great if they still perform~ pros can do what they want~ but manufacturers/retailers paying for the photos are also free to request that pros wear helmets in those photo shoots.",Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,3
1488,Helmets in climbing,2,15, Its been said that serious injuries would be substantially reduced if even mountain walkers wore helmets. I think this came from a mountain rescue team. I've definitely been saved from serious head injury twice: once in a direct head first fall onto rock~ and once in a very long fall/slide while returning from a snow climb (lucky I hadn't removed it). In the first instance the coating from the crown of the helmet was splattered over the rock; the helmet was for climbing but had motorbike specifications~ good lateral protection and was very heavy by modern standards. Second instance the helmet ended up with a small hole above the forehead~ I have no memory of the fall. In both cases my neck hurt for a long time; I later found that I had a healed fracture of a cervical vertebra which was almost certainly related. I've also often been struck by small rocks and ice. I now wear a helmet almost anywhere that I might slip including on the walk in or scrambling. If I've got a helmet in my pack it might just as well be on my head. I don't wear one on small top rope crags~ even here a club member had a head injury from a tumble while coming back down so perhaps I'm illogical. Presumably there are potential dangers: indoor walls ban them presumably due to risk of catching on bolts or being somehow dropped on other customers. Its like car seat belts: a common reason given for not wearing them was that one could be burnt to death if they failed to release. Doubtless that's happened somewhere~ but a tremendous number of serious injuries must have been prevented since belts became compulsory in the UK.,May 2018,Jun 13 2020,1

I typically wear one for multipitch~ most 1-pitch trad climbs~ and mtn biking. I know it would be safer for me to wear one all the time~ and I have not experienced my lightweight foam helmet adversely affecting my sending ability.  I've seen first-hand 2 partners who are alive probably because they were wearing helmets when they fell on a multipitch trad lead.  I'll genuinely try to look at this and question ""why do I choose to sometimes and not others?"". I suppose I wear it primarily because I am more concerned about something getting dropped on me.  (When I'm belaying at a crag~ I'm under the illusion that I can stay out of the line of fire~ for the most part.)  It's nice to also have that extra level of safety when there is more likelihood for bigger falls (i.e.~ trad climbing-- especially during the first handful of years when you are still less reliably placing and trusting bomber gear-- although I feel more solid with gear now~ perhaps the habit of wearing one kind of remains for me~ even on a ""safe"" Creek hands splitter).  Sport climbs~ by definition~ are intended to allow for ""safe"" falls and I still generally foolishly trust that-- despite having witnessed/experienced that some sport climbs are poorly bolted~ weird falls are always possible~ and that falling before or while clipping the 2nd or 3rd bolt could sometimes result in a ground fall.What would get me to wear one almost all the time? Sadly~ it would probably be either (a) seeing or experiencing something bad~ or (b) seeing a majority of climbing magazine photos/vids of (typically top-level) sport climbers wearing and advocating for them~ and the strongest climbers in my area wearing them. I hate to argue with those of you who say you should always wear one (on this site or out at the crag)~ because I know that you are right and that my rationale is inconsistent.  Not to defend myself~ but it's worth noting that my risk tolerance may be a bit higher than it is for some (I do enjoy trad climbing~ and climbing in the mountains~ etc.)~ and I started at a time when helmets were less commonly used than they are now (~20 years ago).  Thanks for the posts~ reading these perspectives and about the accidents does cause me to reconsider and be more likely to wear a helmet more often~ without a doubt.",Apr 2006,Jun 15 2020,3
1510,Helmets in climbing,3,17, Thanks George; super refreshing to hear a highly competent and strong climber admit this. We like to think we aren't influenced by other climbers~ but we all are.  These two reasons are why I wear one. I  saw some people wear one at the crag once~ I assumed they were gumbies~ and then they crushed very hard~ and I realized I needed to check my assumptions. Then~ about a month later my wife took a HUGE surprise whip (clipping hold broke) that could have seriously fucked her up if she had had her leg behind the rope accidentally while casually clipping the chains. Those two experiences together changed my habits.,Apr 2013,Jun 15 2020,2
1511,Helmets in climbing,3,18, One time I was belaying and there was a climber on a route 15 or 20 feet to my right. They pulled off a baseball sized rock that flew sideways right towards my head. I was able to react enough to move my head but it did hit my right upper trapezius muscle. It just bounced off and didn't even leave a bruise so I was pretty lucky. I was not wearing a helmet and I still don't when belaying (unless the wall is very chossy~ but then why would I be climbing there?).,Apr 2017,Jun 15 2020,1
1512,Helmets in climbing,3,19, I wear a helmet 100% of time outdoors on ropes climbing and belaying.  I come from a mountain biking background~ so its just natural. I have to say that some rock climbing helmets are really ugly~ IMHO.,Nov 2019,Jun 17 2020,0
1513,Helmets in climbing,4,0, I feel like I’m falling victim to some pervasive conspiracy promoted by “big helmet”....I only have one head~ never heard of~ or needed helmets as a kid growing up~ and yet now I have over a dozen helmets just for me (climbing~ biking~ whitewater~ snow sports~ parachuting~ motorcycle~ etc)  Add in my whole family~ and I need a separate garage for helmets alone.  Time to combine into one.  Probably based on a bike helmet.,Jun 2013,Jun 18 2020,6
1514,Helmets in climbing,4,1, About 30 years ago I read an article in one of the climbing magazines about helmets and TBIs. Up to that time I had not thought about a helmet for climbing but the article made sense to me so I went out to buy one. None of the climbing helmets fit my head right but I found a kayaking helmet that was comfortable so I bought that. Following weekend~ I went to the Valley with a partner. Got to the base of the first route of the day and realized I had left the new helmet in the car. Rationalized: “well~ I’ve already climbed 10 years without needing a helmet~ one more day won’t hurt”. Ten minutes later I proceeded to take a 40 foot pretty clean fall that at some point flipped me front to back so that at the end of the fall the back of my head upper shoulder smacked against a protrusion on the face. When my partner called up to ask if I was OK~ I thought my arm was broken because I couldn’t feel it or move it. By the time he lowered me to the ground the feeling was coming back into my arm but I could tell I had hit my head hard. It was bad enough I thought it might result in my dying.  The drive to the Valley Clinic~ Jack was asking me questions about who was president etc. but alI I could do was say~ Jack~ please tell Michael how sorry I am and how much I love him. Please tell my family I was thinking about them before I died.  Well I lived~ with a bad concussion and some nerve damage into my arm that took a while to resolve. I’ve never forgotten the helmet again. I personally feel like it’s an important piece of gear. It has gotten whacked since then in various scenarios and replaced a couple of times. I’m so used to wearing it that I’ll often forget to take it off for the hike out.,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,6
1515,Helmets in climbing,4,2, I wear my helmet out at the end of the day probably 30% of the time. One evening~ at the end of a day where I had been by myself all day~ in a relatively remote area~ I thoughtlessly put my helmet on~ and on the way out~ at the sketchiest part of the trail~ I raised up into a leg sized branch on a tree and absolutely pile drived myself. It was so hard of an impact that I saw stars for a minute or so~ and I knew that if I'd been without my helmet on~ it would have knocked me out for sure. The worst~ if I would have fallen down there~ there's a solid chance I would have died.  Moral of the story: dont leave giant limbs hanging over your trail that can knock you out! And wear your helmet out if there's difficult terrain still left.,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,4
1516,Helmets in climbing,4,3, I seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when I'm wearing the helmet.  I think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head.,Aug 2011,Jun 18 2020,4
1517,Helmets in climbing,4,4, I seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when I'm wearing the helmet.  I think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head. I suspect that has at least as much~ if not more~ to do with the “boundaries” of your head having suddenly changed...kinda like a kid stubbing their toe a bunch when they are growing.,Apr 2020,Jun 18 2020,2
1518,Helmets in climbing,4,5, I seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when I'm wearing the helmet.  I think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head. You're right. There's a good chance I would have seen it without a helmet~ but I was insanely tired and who knows if I would have been paying attention more or not~ but ramming the top of my head during the step up would have been very bad. Ultimately I just got lucky. That branch~ not so lucky.,Sep 2017,Jun 18 2020,1
1519,Helmets in climbing,4,6," I seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when I'm wearing the helmet.  I think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head. yeah me too~ but its probably proprioception~ I can't see my helmet in my ""peripheral"" or maybe the fact that your hair can act like a feeler to warn you before you bonk your head~ either way when I bonk my head with a helmet it doesn't hurt so no harm done~ rather have the occasional~ clunk oh yeah helmet than get hit in the head.",Apr 2015,Jun 18 2020,1
1520,Helmets in climbing,4,7," yeah me too~ but its probably proprioception~ I can't see my helmet in my ""peripheral"" or maybe the fact that your hair can act like a feeler to warn you . I’m exact opposite.  My trouble now isn’t proprioception~ it’s priapism from past head injuries.  Need to rely on peripheral vision as my forward vision is blocked.  Can act like a feeler though ( to the alarm of other trail users)",Jun 2020,Jun 18 2020,2
1521,Helmets in climbing,4,8, I wear a helmet because why the fuck not? It’s pretty comfortable compared to head injury. On one of my very first outdoor climbing experiences~ a fist sized rock missed my head by mere centimeters. I wear a helmet on all roped climbs now.  The most memorable was when our group of four had just finished a climb and were packing up though we were still 20ft up on a scramble. Everyone else had taken their helmets off aside from me and we joked and made a comment on how everyone else should still keep them on. I shit you not~ ten seconds later~ I took a rock to my helmet. A friend once made fun of me for wearing a helmet while snowboarding~ and that same day~ the motherfucker got a concussion from falling and slamming his head against ice. He went home and bought a helmet.  Only got one head. Gotta protect it lmaoo.,Oct 2018,Jun 18 2020,5
1522,Helmets in climbing,4,9, Sounds like I need a trail running helmet... I have slammed head on into a branch like that while trail running. left me flat on the ground and no memory of falling. Scared my gf to death since we were way back in some remote mountains in SE AZ.,Mar 2013,Jun 18 2020,2

1524,Helmets in climbing,4,11, Just a couple of weeks ago a friend of friend (5.12 climber) slipped clipping the second bolt on a 5.9.  He fell upside down and landed on his head.  He wasn't wearing a helmet~ and is suffering from brain damage.   1- I always wear a helmet~ and feel naked if I don't.  Only time I take it off is to fit into some off-widths. 2- I think helmets should provide 360 impact protection.   3- I think they are well designed and getting better.  Mammut and BD now have MIPS technology.  I purchased the MIPS helmet~ and it fits like a dream. 4- I don't believe they are exaggerated.  The argument that they could worsen injuries just doesn't make sense to me.   5- No comment. 6- Absolutely not~ everyone should decide for themselves.  Can you imagine convincing Jeff Lowe that he always has to wear a helmet?  ,Jun 2017,Jun 19 2020,2

1536,Tagline,1,10, Given that you should always put the big dynamic line through an anchor plus the natural stretch of a dynamic line when rapping~ the extra 5 is just to be sure you don't rap off the end of your pull cord by accident. Next time I use mine to rap I'll pay attention to how close the ends come to lining up as I near the bottom. ,Jan 2016,Jun 22 2020,0
1537,Tagline,1,11," I believe it is in Mark Twight's book that it is mentioned that all half-ropes will withstand at least one UIAA test-fall with the 80kg weight~ but manufactures aren't allowed to make the claim. (halfs are~ I believe~ tested and given a #-of-falls-rating with a 40kg weight). Think about how a half rope is used: You leave the belay~ clip rope1 into protection 1~    then rope 2 into protection2~    then rope 1 into protection3 .... What if you fall before you clip protection#2???   Is UIAA really going to certify a rope that would break in this situation? Somehow I don't think so.  Twins~ of course~ are designed for both ropes to go into every protection point~ but have you seen a twin rope that isn't also ""half"" rated? Might be one or two out there somewhere. Does Edelrid make a belay device that is certified to work with said 6mm line?  That's a pretty small diameter~ most belay devices ""bottom out"" at around 7mm if I'm not mistaken.",Aug 2013,Jun 22 2020,0
1538,Tagline,1,12, I prefer the cheapest 1/2~ twin~ etc rope - that way you can lead on it in extenuating circumstances. Bought my 7.9mm line for under $90.  or if the 60m set goes on sale again: shop.epictv.com/en/ropes/be… that is the lightest two 60m rope setup. My current Beal Joker + tagline weigh 12.3 lbs - the 7.3mm gully twins are 9.6 lbs for 60m (would require new belay devices~ though) ,Oct 2010,Jun 22 2020,1
1539,Tagline,1,13, Have you looked into the Edelrid Rap Line II? It's rated for a fall although it's not dynamic. Basically it acts like a screamer if you fall on it while trying to lead back up to free a stuck rope. I haven't used it personally but that is the one that I will probably buy.,Apr 2015,Jun 22 2020,1
1540,Tagline,1,14, Using any sort for half rope or non-static pull cord/haul line isn’t worth the added benefit especially with some semistatic products that are theoretically able to withstand one fall.  Pulling all of the stretch out of a dynamic lead line when hauling and/or rappelling is heinous and tiring. ,Oct 2007,Jun 22 2020,0

1544,Tagline,1,18, The Rap Line can be used with the Micro Jul~ but Edelrid makes and recommends the Mago 8.  It's a modified figure 8 with a built in stitch plate.

1545,Tendon Gear Bag,1,0, I couldn’t find much info about this pack before I decided to ask Santa for it.  First impression is good. It’s big and comfortable and everything goes in and out without much fuss. The pics maybe don’t show it but there is room to spare on this 45L pack.  It comes with a basic rope tarp too.    It’s like carrying a Nokia clamshell phone on your back. Like strapping a big clamshell made out of a casserole dish zipped onto a rectangular salad bowl that opens up into a nice love seat of climbing gear.   The bag is easy to use even when not fully splayed open.  Just carefully open the lips and explore what’s inside.  Water goes on the outside but could go on the inside. There are no compression straps but I’m not sure if I’ll need them or not. There’s a few external loops that a mesh could be made of shock cord if needed. Seems perfect for a roomy trad crag bag.  But for hauling or multipitch~ caution will have to be taken not to unzip the pack too far.   I wanted a bag that was easy and this one is. Fill it~ flip it~ zip it. ,Aug 2009,Jan 4 2019,1

Yes~ but that is simply my experience~ I don't doubt that they do sell some seconds~ I just think saying that most of their inventory is seconds is not accurate.  It is pretty easy see that a lot of their inventory comes in after items are discontinued.  Your argument that they do not specifically call out items that are seconds can cause concern for some~ but for me this is a non-issue.,Jun 2014,Sep 7 2018,0

2209,BD solution for big walling,1,7, The solution is pretty comfortable~ but it's not great for carrying lots of gear. While I haven't big walled in it~ I have rap bolted a few routes in it and after a while it starts to get super uncomfortable due to having a bunch of weight hanging from it. Sitting in it isn't so bad~ and honestly~ is more or less equivalently comfortable to my MM Cadillac harness.  The gear loops on the solution are small. They make a Solution Guide which has slightly larger gear loops in the front. With a standard solution~ I'd guess you could have a single rack of cams and a handful of draws on each side and be maxed out.

2211,BD solution for big walling,1,9, Except where it actually matters~ the tie in points. I shredded the tie in points of a solution guide in like two months. BD said it must have been defective and gave me a new one~ and the same thing happened. I've been climbing in a normal solution now and the tie in points are way beefier and last longer. Why they would make the rest of the harness more durable but slim down the load-bearing part of the harness is totally beyond me. The solution guide is garbage.,Nov 2013,Jun 29 2020,3
2212,BD solution for big walling,1,10, For bigwalling it's important to determine whether you're using a portaledge or not. If you're using a portaledge then you'll just flag it it and have it at every belay and so the harness comfort is irrelevant. Freeclimbing harnesses suck a bit if you're following or leading a long pitch of mostly aid but in your case that won't be a concern. If you're not going to have a portaledge then almost all freeclimbing harnesses will suck for a hanging belay but again if it's mostly freeclimbing then it won't be any different really from a long multipitch. You'll need to get your leg hauling on point though so you're not hauling from the harness.,Jan 2007,Jun 29 2020,1
2213,BD solution for big walling,1,11, I use a BD Solution harness as my primary harness and haven't had an issue with the size of the gear loops. I regularly carry a full double rack with 9 carabiners on each front loop (0.1 through #3). Does it get a little bit busy? Yes. Has it been an issue for me? No. I've aided~ free climbed~ hauled~ jugged~ and slept in that harness with no problems. You might be able to find a more comfortable harness for big walls~ but if you end up with the Solution~ I highly doubt it would be the thing that stops you.,Jul 2015,Jun 29 2020,2
2214,BD solution for big walling,1,12, Not only is the Solution Guide more durable but it also has a 5th gear loop and larger front gear loops.  I've put over 100 pitches (with plenty of granite and sandstone OW/chimney) on mine and it still looks brand new...not sure what the hell the other guy's doing to shred his tie in points. ,Jun 2016,Jun 30 2020,0
2215,BD solution for big walling,1,13, not sure what the hell the other guy's doing to shred his tie in points.  Taking lots of whips~ I wanted this as my sport climbing harness so maybe not the guide. :/,Oct 2015,Jun 30 2020,0
2216,BD solution for big walling,1,14, Taking lots of whips~ I wanted this as my sport climbing harness so maybe not the guide. :/ I had the OG regular solution for a few years and finally wore through the piece of elastic that holds the leg loops in place. While not load bearing~ I figured it couldn't hurt to upgrade/get a new one since my tape fixes weren't holding and it was kind of annoying having the leg loops move around. As a replacement I bought the Solution guide (mostly for the bigger gear loops)~ and I've been using it for a handful of months now. The belay loop is diferent and the tie in points were covered in an outer layer/material on the original solution~ but not on the guide. I do a shitload of whipping and I really don't think that's it. I'm primarily a sport climber. I did wear through the outer material/layer on the original solution.  Wearing the guide without a shirt is more uncomfortable than my original because they changed the inner mesh/lining on and it's rougher on my skin. Also~ the new guide has some exposed webbing on the leg loops where the old solution has the webbing covered by the outer material~ which i liked. I don't think it'll be an issue~ but I did wear through that outer material on my old solution so we'll see how the webbing on the guide leg loops holds up. All in all~ I'd agree - the guide is a step forward and a step back at the same time for a solid step sideways. If it wasn't for the larger front loops I'd probably get the standard solution. ,Jan 2016,Jun 30 2020,0
2217,BD solution for big walling,1,15, I've put over 100 pitches (with plenty of granite and sandstone OW/chimney) on mine and it still looks brand new...not sure what the hell the other guy's doing to shred his tie in points.  Yeah I will admit that I did a lot of sport climbing in the Guide~ but my point remains~ why would they intentionally slim down the tie in points while beefing up the rest of the harness? Makes no sense to me~ as they clearly weren't trying to make an ultralight harness. ,Nov 2013,Jun 30 2020,1

2228,What would you do in this situation,1,0, Situation: You are double rope rapping with a 8.4 tag line and a 9.0 lead line. We are single rope rapping off the 9.0 since we both have gri gris. The rap stations are equipped with standard rap rings. You tie the ropes together with a standard overhand knot and you realize that the knot of these two small diameters ropes is pretty small and looks like it could be pulled through the rap rings with enough force. You retie with a figure 8 and then try a fisherman's as well and both those look small enough to pull through. At least small enough to make you nervous. What would you do? Here is what we did (but I am looking for other opinions) We put the tag line on belay for the first rapper to prevent it from pulling through. Then when first rapper was down at the next station~ they put the tag line on belay (fixed it) for the second rapper. What would have been our other options? (edit: to add the detail of single rope rapping off gri gris),Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,1
2229,What would you do in this situation,1,1, Were you concerned that it would be pulled through somehow during the rap? I do a lot of multipitch climbing on a pair of 8.1’s~ and I’m pretty sure that a flat overhand on them could fit through a rap ring if you really try. It has never been an issue. Edit: the single-rope GriGri rap is a completely different thing~ you are absolutely right to be concerned. Biner block. ,Oct 2017,Jun 22 2020,4
2230,What would you do in this situation,1,2, It is the OP’s rope diameter difference that raises the question. Edit: well~ I was wrong.  The fatter rope typically creates more friction running through the rap device. This leads to the fatter rope being pulled on with more of the rappellers weight. And that tends to cause the ropes to run through the anchor leading to fatally uneven rope ends.,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,1
2231,What would you do in this situation,1,3, My main concern was having the knot being pulled through the rap rings because it was such a small knot being created by two skinny ropes.  Another detail I left out that is important.. We were single rope rapping on the 9.0 since we both had gri gris.,Aug 2003,Jun 22 2020,0
2232,What would you do in this situation,1,4, I don’t think this poses much of an issue~ the flat overhand should be fine for the situation. If you are nervous about the thicker rope being tugged down~ just make sure to tie solid stopper knots at the ends of both ropes~ or tie the two ropes together at the bottom as well~ creating a closed loop. *this was posted before he specified that he was doing single strand rappels with a grigri. Once he clarified that~ I made another comment recommending a biner block which you can find below this one.*,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,0
2233,What would you do in this situation,1,5, I’d use a flat overhand to tie the ropes together~ close the system~ usually by putting knots in the ends of my ropes~ and rap without worrying. Edit: rapping on a single strand is a big detail to originally leave out! Tying a blocking knot on the backside of the rings and clipping it back to the rap line is usually my preferred method of adding security. ,Mar 2012,Jun 22 2020,3
2234,What would you do in this situation,1,6, You replied as I was typing mine! In that case~ you can incorporate a carabiner where you join the two ropes~ on the tag line side of the rap rings. It should be a big enough block to prevent the knot from sliding through.,Oct 2019,Jun 22 2020,5
2235,What would you do in this situation,1,7, That's a big detail haha. Otherwise the knot pulling through wouldn't be an issue with a plaquette/tube device. In this situation you would use a biner block and use the skinny rope as a tagline. ,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,4
2236,What would you do in this situation,1,8,,Aug 2018,Jun 22 2020,51
2237,What would you do in this situation,1,9, A pretty big detail to leave out! Carabiner block so you can pull the tag line. Very simple and maybe you should evaluate your systems before you go further. This is very basic and should be a no-brainer. (or 0/10).,Aug 2019,Jun 22 2020,11
2238,What would you do in this situation,1,10, I think in this situation where the concern is the knot being small~ it would be better to mitigate that by putting the biner block on the rap rope and not on the tagline. As demonstrated here: youtu.be/dlKPQ_0f6aI,Jun 2017,Jun 22 2020,8
2239,What would you do in this situation,1,11, I don't do raps on single lines~ even more so on climbing rope and tag line combo.,Feb 2012,Jun 22 2020,4

2242,What would you do in this situation,1,14, This thread is scary. So you tie knots in the ends of your ropes. You toss your 60 meter ropes to the ground which is 55 meters down. You start rapping. The knot pulls through the rap rings. You fall to the ground. Splat. But~ at least it was a closed system???  Huh? ,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,10
2243,What would you do in this situation,1,15," The above comment was obviously issued before the original post was edited to indicate the party was single-rope rapping on the 9mm and using the 8.1 as a true ""tag line"". With a 9.0mm and an 8.1 and both running through my ATC-type-device I would not worry about either creep or knot-through as long at the 9mm went through the ring and the knot was tied on the ""8.1 mm side"". However~ with zero weight on the 8.1 I WOULD be concerned~ especially if there were places where you had to ""jump and stop"" like going over an overhang into free space. A biner on the 8mm-side solves the problem~ or use the full set up as shown by several contributors. ",Aug 2013,Jun 22 2020,2
2244,What would you do in this situation,1,16, However a locker is incorporated~ just be aware that there are various new ways to wind up with a stuck rap rope or other issues: a) cloved locker with I-beam profile stuck during pull at lip of rap ledge; b) locker snag on ‘minor’ shrub during pull when tag line runs down one side of shrub and primary rope runs down the other. c) during rap~ locker pulls up oddly and unclips rope from an anchor biner (I know~ I know - there are usually rings there). d) other?,Apr 2006,Jun 22 2020,3
2245,What would you do in this situation,1,17, This thread is scary. So you tie knots in the ends of your ropes. You toss your 60 meter ropes to the ground which is 55 meters down. You start rapping. The knot pulls through the rap rings. You fall to the ground. Splat. But~ at least it was a closed system???  Huh?  Super scary. So~ if he was to look at the knot and think that it probably won't pop through the anchor ring~ jump on it and go? Wow. Just kind of gauge it by eye I guess. I'm assuming this is multipitch since both were at an anchor (although could be a long single). You got 2 people up there each with only a grigri and no simple tube device? Maybe projecting sick routes. Talk about gym-to-crag. Yeah~ a knot or tying the ropes together (tails) might keep you off the ground if you are several pitches up~ but you are still going to fall until the knot hits the anchor or you are at the bottom of the huge loop. That knot will probably pop through the anchor too~ so no need for stopper knots in this system (saves time!)...,Aug 2019,Jun 22 2020,4

2247,What would you do in this situation,1,19, It's Reepschnur and it may not be the best solution because one cannot use this method to rappel at stations with large rings or carabiners~ or on alpine routes where webbing is used without rings. Which sound likes what the OP is describing.,Jul 2007,Jun 22 2020,1

2250,What would you do in this situation,2,1," So- personally- Id just use a flat overhand~ tie knots and just watch the ends very carefully.  ...as a side I noticed this line from the OP:""You retie with a figure 8 and then try a fisherman's as well and both those look small enough to pull through..."" I'm not completely understanding this sentence (overhand or inline???)  but... you should NEVER tie rap lines together with an overhand fig 8. Lots of data showing this can roll and untie itself.

2255,What would you do in this situation,2,6, I always do a biner block~ even when it doesn't look like it could pull through. I have however thought about how it could be an inconvenience of it did pull through. You'd still be safe~ but there'd be no way to get your ropes back without going back up to the anchors yourself. I figure I'd just ascend the fixed rope or tr solo to get back up and fix it if that ever happened.,Nov 2017,Jun 22 2020,0
2256,What would you do in this situation,2,7, Biner block~ but not as shown in the images. One day the knot joining the ropes will end up squeezing through the rings. Then the rope is stuck.  Rather~ Join the ropes with any sensible knot. Clove the main rope just before the knot to the locker. Clip locker to main rope as in images above. ,Oct 2013,Jun 22 2020,3

2260,What would you do in this situation,2,11, It's Reepschnur and it may not be the best solution because one cannot use this method to rappel at stations with large rings or carabiners~ or on alpine routes where webbing is used without rings. Which sound likes what the OP is describing. Wait. What?  You quoted me because I mispelled it?  But~ got it right phonetically?  ,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1
2261,What would you do in this situation,2,12, Think it through. For the first one down I'd probably just tie it all off (double-strand slip knot and carabiner back to the anchor) or clove hitch a blocking carabiner back to the thicker rope (Why? Second is there to attend it). Second removes all that. For the second~ I'd have the first one down tension up a few metres and tie the skinnier rope to something (themself~ if nothing else~ but there's an anchor~ right?). But~ most probably~ we'd neither of us be using a bloody grigri in this situation. They're shit to abseil on anyway.,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0
2262,What would you do in this situation,2,13, What would I do? ATC.  If the only belay device I had was a grigri? Munter.  If I’m not allowed to munter for some reason? Biner block. ,Apr 2010,Jun 29 2020,2
2263,What would you do in this situation,2,14, As an amendment of that image (assuming that OP's fears are valid) you would be better suited to switch the order of the top and bottom knots (fig 8 & EDK) - the EDK can get sucked into and stuck in the rings before the fig 8 and the biner block engage. Not good for the pull!  It would be better to have the fig 8 biner block on the rap line engage with the rings and to have the EDK behind it - attaching the pull line. ,Mar 2014,Jun 29 2020,2
2264,What would you do in this situation,2,15, Tying ropes together with two rethreaded figure-8s is good. As is a Flemish Bend. Not sure which variation of the fig 8 he is referring to. Fine~ until you pull the ropes. The Flemish bend is a sexy symmetrical knot but less likely to roll over obstructions (edges)~ more likely to work in and get stuck (cracks). Not as likely as a bulky double fisherman's~ but stuck is stuck. Use a double-strand overhand~ ie the EDK (Euro Death Knot) and it will roll over obstructions rather more reliably when pulled~ because it is not symmetrical.,Jan 2015,Jun 29 2020,0
2265,What would you do in this situation,2,16, Hmm.. this just gave me pause for those weird rap stations with mussy hooks (such as in Pine Creek Canyon) and the reepschnuur biner block method. I could see this happening. Scary. ,Mar 2014,Jun 29 2020,0
2266,What would you do in this situation,2,17, Fine~ until you pull the ropes.

Not as likely as a bulky double fisherman's~ but stuck is stuck. Use a double-strand overhand~ ie the EDK (Euro Death Knot) and it will roll over obstructions rather more reliably when pulled~ because it is not symmetrical. Honest question: is the butterfly bend asymmetrical enough to transition edges well?,May 2020,Jun 29 2020,0
2267,What would you do in this situation,2,18, True all~ Artem. My list was meant as a warning that adding a biner can create new issues. And~ for those~ there are often ways to reduce the risk ... you mention some of the ways.,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,0
2268,What would you do in this situation,2,19, It is the OP’s rope diameter difference that raises the question. Edit: well~ I was wrong.  The fatter rope typically creates more friction running through the rap device. This leads to the fatter rope being pulled on with more of the rappellers weight. And that tends to cause the ropes to run through the anchor leading to fatally uneven rope ends. Bill or MP~ how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block? ,Sep 2016,Jun 29 2020,0
2269,What would you do in this situation,3,0, Have the person doing the double rope rap pre-rig their device. This prevents the rope from moving through the rings The Gri Gri owners can then rap without worrying about the rope moving. Then they tend the ends (especially the tag line) to ensure the rope movement isn’t an issue. ,Feb 2011,Jun 29 2020,2
2270,What would you do in this situation,3,1," Wait. What?  You quoted me because I mispelled it?  But~ got it right phonetically?  Shoot me.  You can do better.  I quoted you not because you misspelled it. I corrected the spelling was so others would know the correct name so to learn about it.  However~ and more importantly~ the goal the Reepschnur is make it safe to rappel on a single line. That will work regardless what it is threaded through. (If ya want to gripe I should have uses the term ""should not"" instead of ""cannot""). But one also does not want the knot to get flipped over to the weighted side which was part of what the OP described. If used with large rings or caribiners or on alpine routes where webbing is used without rings the knot can get flipped over to the weighted side. Thus making it pretty much impossible to pull the rope. So no it was not the Reepschnur for the win.",Jul 2007,Jun 29 2020,1
2271,What would you do in this situation,3,2, Not to hijack the thread~ but what do people think about this rappel setup: I'm rapping on a grigri (just visible) against a stopper knot (a super 8 in this case) with a biner for insurance.  The super 8 had previously been used on the musseys (with backup draws on each) and I didn't feel like untying it and retying a normal stopper.  But my concern here is that I'm rapping against musseys whose lateral strength against their spring gates may not be very high.  I wouldn't want to bend/break the gates (although I think I'm not going to die since the backup biner will  hold in any case).,Oct 2016,Jun 29 2020,0
2272,What would you do in this situation,3,3, Bill or MP~ how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block?  Do you mean while rapping with both strands through~ say~ an ATC?,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,0
2273,What would you do in this situation,3,4, Double fishermans will solve this problem,Jun 2014,Jun 29 2020,0
2274,What would you do in this situation,3,5,  I really wonder how often this has happened. It would be easily discovered by the second rapper while the first rapper is descending. Then~ the first one down can provide a little bit of tension on the tag line to mitigate. If communication with the first one down is not an option~ just put both strands in brake hand while rapping. Pretty simple. Common sense for the win.   Personally~ I prefer the reepschur since the overhand on a bight  (not eight) that I use has a flat side much like the EDK making pulls a bit easier. An eight on a bight has a flat side too.  Bit has more bulk than the overhand and provides no additional security in this case. ,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1
2275,What would you do in this situation,3,6, Munter (no extension~ may need double Munter on really skinny ropes~ ) or Biner Brake Belay the first down~ fireman the last (if you are new or trying something new~ are tired or otherwise distracted~ or anytime you have lots of time) Close the system with knot at the bottom Auto block Friggin Grigri's,Dec 2019,Jun 29 2020,1

2277,What would you do in this situation,3,8, Bill or MP~ how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block?  I have never had a problem with rope creep~ and I think it is more a theoretical thing that can happen. I've extensively used a 7mm tag/trail line and rarely set it up as a biner block~ I just double rope rap with it using an ATC. I've had it for a very long time and have paired it with anything from 8.9-10+mm and have never had an issue. I cut it at about 65M to pair with 60M ropes for a little extra safety. Maybe 1-2 feet of slippage due to one being static and the other dynamic - bouncing. If the pull is clean~ I don't even care what side the knot is on. ,Aug 2019,Jun 29 2020,4
2278,What would you do in this situation,3,9, I have never had a problem with rope creep~ and I think it is more a theoretical thing that can happen.  I’ve seen rope creep: 6 mm tag line & ~10 mm rope.,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,1
2279,What would you do in this situation,3,10, ... how can one limit or eliminate the fatally uneven rope ends problem caused by a big difference in rope diameters in situations where pulling down a carabiner block is likely to end in a snagged carabiner block?  I think you are conflating two different things. Let me know if you think I have that wrong.,Apr 2006,Jun 29 2020,2

2281,What would you do in this situation,3,12, I think you are conflating two different things. Let me know if you think I have that wrong. Thank you Bill and others. ,Sep 2016,Jun 30 2020,2
2282,What would you do in this situation,3,13, There is a rather obvious and well documented solution (sorry) but you figured out a quick~ easy and safe way to do it on your own. Good work! ,Jul 2009,Jun 30 2020,0
2283,What would you do in this situation,3,14, What knot would you tie on the end of the 6mm tagline that won’t go thru the ATC?,May 2020,Jun 30 2020,0
2284,What would you do in this situation,3,15, The only reason I kept reading after page one was to make sure someone had said this at some point along the way.  Needed saying.,Jan 2006,Jun 30 2020,2
2285,What would you do in this situation,3,16, I've done this a bunch while rope-soloing and so far I'm still kickin'... though it' probably not the safest thing to do. I set it up this way after leading sometimes in case I wanna do a subsequent TR lap; if not I can just pull the rope and move on. The knot seems to jam mostly against the hook part of the mussy rather than the gate. I'd be more concerned about the rope accidentally unclipping rather than breaking a gate~ though I'd imagine either is possible. ,Nov 2007,Jun 30 2020,1
2286,What would you do in this situation,3,17, I’ve seen rope creep: 6 mm tag line & ~10 mm rope. Yeah~ there can be a little bit or rope slip~ but it is not the big deal folks make it out to be and it is easy to manage by adjusting the tension in your break hand to allow the ropes to flow through evenly~ keeping an eye on things and giving a little extra slack on the fat rope~ etc.Certainly not a phenomemon that needs a solution beyond normal rapping practices (knots~ wathing then ends...). ,Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,1
2287,What would you do in this situation,3,18, Yes~ but then the multipitching grigri people will have a problem and still won't know how to get down (or up). I guess you could go with 8.5mm and above and each carry 2 grigris for belaying...,Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,1
2288,What would you do in this situation,3,19, Yes~ but then the multipitching grigri people will have a problem and still won't know how to get down (or up). I guess you could go with 8.5mm and above and each carry 2 grigris for belaying... ????  Two Gri Gris per person?  It would be lighter for such a team to have A single Gri Gri and a tube device per the whole team.  Belay with the Gri Gri on one dual rated rope and on descent~ the first rapper uses the GG to descend on a fixed rope~ the second Pulls the knot~ to re-establish traditional rappel and uses the tube.,Jun 2013,Jun 30 2020,1
2289,What would you do in this situation,4,0, ????  Two Gri Gris per person?  It would be lighter for such a team to have A single Gri Gri and a tube device per the whole team.  Belay with the Gri Gri on one dual rated rope and on descent~ the first rapper uses the GG to descend on a fixed rope~ the second Pulls the knot~ to re-establish traditional rappel and uses the tube. Yes~ I was kidding . The thread started with the conundrum of how to get down and they only had grigris... just trying to bring it full-circle. Pretty much all of these 'work-arounds' are solved by simply having a tube device.,Aug 2019,Jun 30 2020,2
2290,What would you do in this situation,4,1, Yeah~ there can be a little bit or rope slip~ but it is not the big deal folks make it out to be ... There is definitely a lot of variability in how close climbers like to get to the void.,Apr 2006,Jun 30 2020,0

2292,Anyone into Sewing?,1,1, Quest outfitters all-day~ yes the interface sucks but Kim over there is the bomb and super helpful. Also have had good luck with The Rainshed.Ripstop by the roll eats booty. Stupid half yard nonsense and having to order a dozen fasteners at a time is such a waste.

2301,Anyone into Sewing?,1,10, nice work~ first time? looks like youve got the idea how to piece stuff together pretty well. the machine you posted further down isnt heavy enough to do thicker stuff most likely~ you might get away with rolling the machine by hand (if you can do that with it) and sewing heavier stuff. i have industrial machines i picked up from ebay and sewing places that i use for rigging parachute stuff~ so i have a bunch of nylon~ cordura~ and shitloads of ripstop and zero p in every color imaginable for patching canopies. unfortunately~ my old lady and all her friends know i have them and i always have a bunch of horse blankets to patch from the dumbass horses ripping them~ or replacing the straps and velcro.....,Jul 2012,Mar 17 2020,6
2302,Anyone into Sewing?,1,11, Thanks for the kind words everyone. Currently working on a chalk bucket. I definitely want a heavier duty machine soon. Struggling to stitch through webbing. Post up some pics of your stuff people!,Jul 2014,Mar 17 2020,3
2303,Anyone into Sewing?,1,12, Been using Ripstop by the roll a bit lately. I've found them pretty good~ yeah they sell by half a yard...Not sure how that's a big negative(?). Made duffle bags~ pouches~ a backpack so far. Staying away from silnylon shelters since big pieces of slippery fabrics will probably anger me.,Apr 2015,Mar 17 2020,1
2304,Anyone into Sewing?,1,13, I've ordered plenty from Outdoor Wilderness Fabrics~ they have a pretty good selection and great customer service. I've made fleece jackets~ pants~ WPB jacket~ several backpacks~ a few chalk bags~ and plenty of other gear in mind to make.  Current project is ~50L crag bag.  I still have to work despite everything around us shutting down~ so slower progress.  Also tweaking my idea part way through and thinking through how to put everything together when it's not just a tube slows me down a lot.,Apr 2014,Mar 17 2020,0
2305,Anyone into Sewing?,1,14, Quest Outfitters and Ripstop by the roll seem to be the best to me for low quantity fabric and parts. I sew bags for a different sport~ but make some climbing stuff on the side. Go find a used single needle walking foot machine by Juki or really even the knock-off versions. $700 and you'll be set for a long time. Here's some of the most recent creations,Jun 2013,Mar 17 2020,8
2306,Anyone into Sewing?,1,15, love the fanny pack! nice work!,Jun 2014,Mar 17 2020,1
2307,Anyone into Sewing?,1,16," Nice work~ Max et al.  I have long said that one of the best skills for an outdoorsperson of any stripe to learn is sewing.  Once someone asked me what I thought the most useful backcountry skill I had learned was~ and I said~ ""making a bar tack.""  Back in the day~ of course~ we all would have been ordering patterns by mail and sewing our own backpacks and sleeping bags and whatnot.  I'm not saying I'm that good~ but over the years I have found that my own messy-but-functional sewing skills have allowed me to save a whole lot of gear that would have otherwise have needed replacing and also to modify many pieces of gear that otherwise would have not fit my scrawny frame as well or worked as reliably.  It has also made me the default repairer of all buttons~ blown knees~ and holey socks for my entire family. A few of the items I have made or modified over the years: -- climbing pants (added some crotch gussets before that was really a thing-- yes~ they looked terrible and yes~ they worked well) -- jacket wrist cuffs -- ankle cuff cinches -- leather reinforcements on fingers and thumbs of ice climbing gloves -- ice axe leashes -- crampon bag -- haul bucket for bolting equipment -- ski carry straps -- gear sled (ok~ the straps were sewn; the rest was cutting and screwing and riveting aluminum & plastic parts) -- countless stuff sacks of weird sizes -- hut slippers -- rope bags -- backpack chest straps -- ice tool holsters -- ski pant stirrups -- gaiters -- stuff bag- summit packs -- sleeping tarp -- and the piece-de-resistance that was mostly a big silly waste of time:  my very own homemade Chinese-style conical sun hat like Kavu used to sell~ made of nylon~ rayon~ and 1/4"" closed-cell foam; man~ it was dumb",Jan 2006,Mar 17 2020,5
2308,Anyone into Sewing?,1,17, Kind of digging that fanny pack you made.  Nice. I had Tuesday off thanks to the CoVids so I took some Polartec Powerdry and Schoeller Dynamic soft-shell material I had laying around and made myself some new bib ski pants.,Apr 2011,Mar 17 2020,19
2309,Anyone into Sewing?,1,18, Nice work ... BITD before so many mfg were making gear a bunch of us sewed our own gear. We were also cheap and we could buy Gore-Tex by the roll. I made a pair of full side zip bibs some insulated over boots for climbing Denali~ bivy sac~ chalk bags~ lots of stuff sacks~ and pockets. One pocket is now nearly 40 years old and I still use it for a food bag. That thing has been all over the world and up many a hill.,Jul 2007,Mar 17 2020,4

There was a thru hiker website many years ago that had free patterns for stuff like that. an ultra light synthetic quilt isn’t to hard to make~ the foot box is the tricky part.

2321,Anyone into Sewing?,2,9, Used to run a mom and pop local sewing biz in the 80's. I've made most everything~ clothes~ tents~ backpacks~ daypacks~ duffles~ dog packs~ panniers~ ditties~ knick knacks~ climbing harness~ some vertical caving gear etc. Back then got end rolls and leftover overstock fabrics from lowe alpine in broomfield~ and commercial suppliers in Denver. More recently I've picked up odds and ends from OWF~ and Rockywoods fabrics. Still have a bomber Pfaff walking foot single needle machine~ real workhorse~ will sew from tafetta to multiple layers of cordura plus foam and webbing for pack belts and shoulder straps. id love to have a serger or at least something with excellent overcast stretch stitch for stretch fabrics.,Mar 2009,Mar 18 2020,4

My buddy swears by a sailrite as a do-it-all machine~ but alas~ youll still need a bartacker if you wanna resling those cams. ,Oct 2014,Mar 18 2020,3
2325,Anyone into Sewing?,2,13, I used to sew all my own slings and harnesses using a straight stitch machine. You just have to use the right thread~ right stitch pattern~ right number of stitches for the item and have some method of testing. I tested with a padded hydraulic jack and also a Nissan 4x4 combined with a logging chain and a 4' DBH Oak. REI had an article on how to make your own runners that got me started. Even found a pound of Kevlar and of  Spectra thread when they first came out. The Kevlar didn't fair so well after being sewn~ but the Spectra required only 1/4 the stitches as the nylons and polyesters I was using. I  have a Bar Tack machine now~ but just sent away my old cams to Mountain Tools since they had a nice selection of colors for the webbing.,Dec 2019,Mar 18 2020,6

2333,Anyone into Sewing?,3,1, There is some good stuff folks are making.  I will toss something out that I suggested to some commercial folks. Many of us have dogs and like us dogs gotta shit. I don't mind bagging their poop but it is a bit of a PITA to carrying it when you're out for a quick run/hike/ride/ski. It my dog's poop so she should carry it. I have looking at making Puppy Poop Pack. Something simple like a fanny pack for dogs. There are some great lightweight harness out there~ they just need pouch on them without becoming full on side bags. And while we are showing off the cool thing we all have sewn over the years what is the silliest thing ? For me it was probably what is in the attached photo (I will people guess what it is holding).,Jul 2007,Mar 18 2020,0

I get most of my supplies from ripstop by the roll~ seattle fabrics~ and outdoor wilderness fabrics.  Have had good experiences from all these suppliers.  I also have been 3d printing some plastic hardware (ladder locks~ piping sliders~ etc) which has proven useful.

2348,Anyone into Sewing?,3,16, this is all awesome stuff and I'm super motivated now after reading this thread. I've been thinking of taking the time and getting a machine for my own use but I want something that will do both delicate work like repairs or something like that but also be able to stitch together heavier stuff like webbing or canvas. I was shopping around online and I see that Michaels carries a few models of singer that are purpose built for being able to stitch have your stuff but can they do lighter stuff to?

2350,Anyone into Sewing?,3,18, As for surgical masks~ ugh~ I've been kind of surprised at how little technical information about them that's available here on the internets.  Concerning to me is how much suspect information that has popped up in the past week.  There's a lot of misunderstanding.  To help a local group of makers producing masks for healthcare workers here on the front range~ I summed up what information I could get my hands on and put it here:,Apr 2011,Mar 25 2020,1

Yes and no~ I have an old Janome and it will handle up to 3 layers of canvas if  you go slow and gentle and use the right needle~ I am looking into a more industrial straight stitch machine though because it will wear the poor thing out (I don't do that much canvas~ but I'm starting to sew my own jeans and denim is heavy too)~ so take into account how much you'll be sewing.  Most basic machines will do lightweight stuff~ you just have to adjust the foot pressure and thread tension~ and for multiple layers and slippery fabrics~ invest in a walking foot~ you will thank yourself later.,Apr 2017,Mar 27 2020,0

2391,Anyone into Sewing?,5,19, I get a lot of my fabric from Rockywoods. X-Pac fabric is not inherently puncture proof~ it's inherently waterproof due to the thin plastic film. If you want puncture resistance you could do a thin Kevlar or woven dyneema fabric. Kevlar w/urethane may be best as the dyneema will probably puncture easier due to the slippery fibers. I use a sailrite LSZ-1 currently. Straight / zig zag walking foot. I used a Juki straight stitch industrial with knee lift and clutch motor before this and a more pedestrian Babylock mostly plastic machine before that. I really miss the knee lift. Getting close to finishing a ~20L bag in silver DX40 fabric from Alpine Luddites. Should finish today. I want to try some stretch garmets like sun hoodys soon~ but doing it on the sailrite might be a bit of a pain. Plus I only have v69 and 92 thread on hand. Sewing webbing is not that difficult. Proper thread~ needle~ tension~ and stitches...  Then pull testing~ which you can probably find a local place that will do a few for next to free~ because they like to break stuff too. You don't need barracks~ they are just good for manufacturers since a machine can do them fast and very repeatable. Industrial lifting slings almost never use them. They use many long back and forth straight stitches.,Feb 2013,Apr 11 2020,3

2397,Anyone into Sewing?,6,5," I would recommend that you get a machine which has a walking foot. Almost all standard home sewing machines will be able to sew the materials that are commonly used for making tarps~ hammocks~ backpacks~ etc. They can also usually deal with sewing a couple of layers of webbing without much fuss. I think you only need to have a machine that can sew straight stitches (they ALL do that) and zig-zag stitches to begin with. Actually~ for the ""delicate"" or ""heavier stuff"" - the more important than the actual sewing machine is the needle and the thread. I have worked with all kinds of machines from the really cheap sewing machines to the top of the line (currently I work with Juki DDL-8700). And I learned that using proper needles does wonders even with basic machines (in the past I had a basic Heavy duty Singer~ and I was able to sew through multiple layers of canvas at lower speed and with heavy duty needle). So~ good luck in case you're still choosing! As for us~ we're sewing masks for relatives~ friends and for charity with occasional breaks for equipment~ though all of our trips were canceled. ",Sep 2018,Apr 17 2020,0

2461,Anyone into Sewing?,9,9, beautiful bike bags! I have a question-- how many liters do those bags end up being able to carry? I've always imagined that frame bags have a really high weight-to-capacity ratio... ,Sep 2013,May 27 2020,0
2462,Anyone into Sewing?,9,10, Frame bags definitely don't carry much when compared to panniers~ but they're not horrible. The surly bag should hold about 7.25L. Not sure on the weight~ but it's the lightest bag I own. Since the bike frame provides the structure~ you can go really light on a frame bag.,Nov 2013,May 27 2020,0
2463,Anyone into Sewing?,9,11, thanks for the response-- 7L is pretty small~ but i guess its better than nothing. Though~ to be fair~ you now have to carry water somewhere else~ so the effective gain in capacity is more like 5-6L. ,Sep 2013,May 27 2020,0

2483,Top Rope Solo set up,1,5, Check out the history of the ropeman2 redesign. If memory serves~ WC switched from pinchy grooves to pointed teeth because the pinchy grooves were pretty effective at sheathing ropes under abrupt substantial loading. I own/use a Lift for (relatively low volume TRS’ing)~ but have been eager to replace it. It does the job~ but you definitely need to weight the rope below the device to prevent it just hauling the rope up slack as you go.   also recommend you search the forums~ as this topic has definitely been covered before (fairly exhaustively and fairly recently~ too). Darren Mabe recommends the Camp Goblin~ and if anyone would have a decent perspective and solid advice~ it’s probably him. The Goblin looks like a fantastic device~ imo.,Jul 2010,Jun 29 2020,1
2484,Top Rope Solo set up,1,6," I only find the microtrax can fuzz ropes if you attempt to shift it/remove it while partially weighted. I.e. ""sagging"" into it on a fall does nothing.

2532,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,3,3," The link to that prior thread discusses what I'm talking about. While that particular instance may have been a questionable placement I had the same thing happen to a .4 from a larger fall at squamish~ it wouldn't fully retract and my lobe was pressing hard into the axle due to deformation.  Now going way off the wheels on a tangent. I'm just going to go back to saying ""tight"" or ""tipped out"" because coming from the world building racing engines (dealing with camshafts) the way climbers seem to have interpreted ""camming action"" so strangely and no one is going to bother reading this :)  A ""cam"" is ""a projection on a rotating part in machinery"". When we fully retract climbing cam lobes that's our base~ the smallest amount of expansion (or tightest crack they could fit). As you release the trigger that lobes expand~ the definition of camming action. So why on earth would we call fully expanding something ""under"" camming and fully compressing it ""over"" when by definition a cam is the projection? I can only assume it's because we all have our cams fully expanded before placing them~ but that's just ass backwards. ",Jan 2015,Jun 11 2019,8

2549,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,4,0, got my grubby hands on some Z4's yesterday.  (Benefits to living in SLC with BD employees/testers out using them)   Variable stiffness feature is very cool and works well.  Makes my x4's feel like noodles in comparison.  Can't comment on head width too much as I didn't have my C3s on my rack though they did seem a hair wider eyeballing them.  (Still very narrow tho)   EDIT:  SAME WIDTH THANKS KP!   Good job BD~ they seem quality at first glance.,Apr 2016,Jun 12 2019,20

2551,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,4,2, My buddy was leading so I didn't have anything on me to actually compare to.   I'd say narrower than X4s for sure~ maybe not as narrow as C3s~ but hard to say.

2578,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,9, I played with them a bit at Outdoor Retailer. They are interesting. I'm not impressed with the flexible then stiffer thing. Felt a bit stiffer flexing in the plane of how you would insert it into a crack~ but not much stiffer flexing perpendicular to that. Frankly~ I'm a bit surprised this is an issue for people. The flexing on the X4s has never been problematic for me personally~ nor has it been an annoyance when placing even more flexible cams like the Fixe Alien Revolutions. I seem to remember hearing 5kN for the smallest Z4 size~ but I could be wrong. That is pretty awesome. $10 cheaper than X4s is pretty awesome too. They didn't appear to be more durable than X4s in any way. Could have been my imagination but it seemed like the solid wire going to the lobes appeared slightly thinner than on the X4s. (They did not have X4s or C3s available for side by side comparison). Played around with the DMM Dragonflies as well. They also have a size smaller than X4 0.1 and likely a similar strength. Super flexible~ felt more flexible than Aliens. Not a huge fan of the extendable sling.,Feb 2013,Jun 30 2019,3
2579,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,10, Just for reference~ the smallest Dragonfly (down to 7.8mm~ same as the 4kn rated 000 c3) is rated for 6kn. They originally had published 5kn but the website is now showing 6kn and the one I bought is also showing 6kn,Jun 2013,Jun 30 2019,5

2583,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,14, Great... But there are cams that can catch those falls and WON'T break.  I’m glad someone gets it. They don’t HAVE to be a thinned down lobe~ they could have offset the rotation on a single axle just like they did on the .3 x4 and it would be a tank.,Jan 2015,Jun 30 2019,2
2584,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,15,  JRzane missed the point~ they don’t have to be a design more likely to deform. My point is these tools are GIFTS. Sure these companies make profits~ but no ones forcing you to buy any specific device. If it ‘doesn’t live up to your design standards’ either choose another~ or make your own.,Dec 2015,Jun 30 2019,2
2585,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,16, Along the lines of discussion with the x4s...I've always heard that the offset axle design of the .3 and below caused catastrophic failures in soft rock (windgate). I've led myself to believe to never place .3 and smaller x4s in windgate. Apparently they pulverize the rock and umbrella. Any truth to this? Cant remember where I read this from but probably an old MP thread...I ended up getting rid of my .1 and .2 in favor of C3s...I still place my .3 often,Feb 2014,Jun 30 2019,0
2586,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,17, C3s may be great when placing them~ but Ive read lots of stories of them being so rigid that they popped out when loaded.  The point of a placement is not for it to go in easily~ it’s for it to hold the force of the fall (or body weight in an aid placement). I think this is why the Z4s look cool because they are the head width of the C3s but have the flexibility and don’t place other weird forces where the lobes touch the rock.,Aug 2009,Jun 30 2019,2

Okay~ sure~ if it takes 6 pieces to protect a pitch~ it takes 6 pieces to protect the pitch. But if I am onsighting the pitch~ I'm definitely bringing more than 6 pieces~ because I can't tell from the ground how big the crack is with enough accuracy to tell what piece fits 100% accurately. I at least want a range of cams that covers what I think the possible range in size of the crux protection might be. A larger angle lets you cover that range with fewer cams. I might only place one piece at the crux~ but I'm probably carrying a number of cams in the general size of the crux~ and that number of cams definitely depends on the range of said cams.,Jan 2017,Jul 10 2019,3

2638,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,8,9," I'm still stuck on the holding power convo up thread - looks like metolius cams have 25% more holding power than bd~ based on numbers above. Boondoggle is saying that is why they are better (I note that Hudon also prefers metolius~ for offsets at least). Are others really saying that 25% more holding power doesn't matter in less-than-ideal placements? Seems like all small cam placements are less than ideal to me~ but curious what the counter argument is beyond ""as long as Tan(cam angle) > coefficient of friction~ yer good"" aka if you have enough friction (an ideal placement?) it's fine...  Plenty of rock and conditions come to mind where 25% more holding power would give me the warm n fuzzies w/ a small cam.

2686,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,17, Took a couple days off to go camping. Ken is absolutely right~ and this is why the yield strength is important.  When small cams deform~ the tan angle shoots way up quickly due to the small size.   Don't believe it?  Shrug.  Easy enough to plot out and see for yourself. I've said my piece and have drawers full of broken cams to back up my claims.  Plus 30 years of 16 degree angle cams being sufficient to hold in most rock types. Just for fun~ I'll be willing to test the hypothesis as I have both the capacity to make cams and test them to failure.  Cover my time and materials and I'll do whatever you want.  Same size lobes in different materials/cam angle/hardness?  No problem.  Start a new thread with test criteria and I'll figure a Paypal account. BTW~ as penance for my part in this mess~ I offer up what I use when calculating cam spirals~ which is different than all the online sources.  r=ae^b*theta is a total PITA when it comes to designing around a defined minimum width.  Applying the following coefficient avoids the problem:  1/(Cos[camangle]*Exp[Tan[camangle]*camangle])] This makes the cosine of the curve radius at the cam angle equal to 1 for the unit spiral~ which can be scaled for any size. There are some issues with getting Solidworks to play nice with this when plotting the parametric spiral (I get a 0.39% difference from calculated)~ but with some jiggery-pokery in the Solidworks Equations will play nice with it.,Jun 2019,Jul 14 2019,10

2744,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,3,15, I've had .3 and .4 c4s deform so that they contact the axles and thus hardly work. I've also had most small cams deform and work like shit when you fall hard on them.  I have used the z4s though and I can't wait to have a set of these next to my other cams. The dimensions and range of the heads are pretty slick.  I will miss c3s though as they definitely have there place.  I've had c3s deform too and put too much pressure on the axle making them janky. in general it's best to Crux out above nuts anyway.  The z4s are real nice in action... You'll see.,Dec 2010,Jan 10 2020,3
2745,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,3,16, Played around with the red Z4 and yellow dragonfly today while TR soloing asteroid crack. The Z4 is definitely easier to make a precise placement with. Tight placements are easier to clean with the Z4 as you have more control over the head,Jan 2017,Jan 11 2020,4
2746,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,3,17, I swear a saw a vid with KP from BD saying they “stuck with the 13.75 angle” for the Z4s cause they believe it’s the best overall angle~ “best combination of range and holding power~” but I can’t seem to find it anywhere. I really thought it was in the Beer and Gear review but I rewatched it and did see it in there. It was my major deciding factor to wait and see the reviews for the new WC Zeros with their huge 17.6 angle before picking up a couple new smallies.

The black plastic is not functional beside protecting the 4 cables inside that stabilize the trigger pull along the stem. The ""Z"" pattern of the plastic is nearly all for aesthetic and to give the sheath an accordion or slinky geometry allowing flex and stretch around the functional cables.

2787,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,5,18, That beer can test is hilarious. However~ the problem is that the opposing pressure of the thumb against the thumb loop and fingers pulling down on the trigger inherently stabilizes the stem of any cam~ so IMO not much about BD’s technology is really being shown through those pictures. To me~ it even looks like the index finger in the second picture is applying a little bit more force~ which would likely further aid in not allowing the stem to bend with the weight of the beer can. ,Apr 2019,Jan 27 2020,0

I would also wonder if the Z4 is simply stiffer to begin with than the Mastercam and the Alien~ which would account for the lack of bending~ as opposed to the rigidflex tech. For example~ I think that the Mastercam is stiffer than the Alien~ and it appears to bend at a less severe angle~ so perhaps the Z4 is stiffer than the Mastercam.

2803,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,6,14, Doesn't matter at all.   Kn ultimate strength ratings are not a number that is very relevant to us climbing. Quality of placement~ rock quality~ maybe cam angle and friction are far more important.   If you generate your rope maxes out far under 10 I imagine.  If you generate 10+kn (probably more like 12kn as the cams break quite a bit past their rating) then you're pelvis will be broken and your organs will be mush.   In extremely small RPs ultimate strength may come in to play but I don't think anyone has ripped the head off a .75 in history.  Don't worry about it. Go with what works well for your area.  I've never wanted or needed a narrower .75 but if that's a placement you regularly encounter go for the z4.,Apr 2016,Jan 29 2020,2

2806,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,6,17, I like wild country's stuff in general but I haven't used them so I don't have any opinions.  I get in to the gear nerdery as much as the next guy but in general gears works and it doesn't matter what cam you have in if it's placed well.  A BD engineer told me .1 X4s which are a similar size to the cams you mentioned regularly pull test over 2200 lbs.... or  9-10KN.   These cams fail by pulling out of the rock not breaking.  The ratings has nothing to do with what amount of force it pulls out of X rock type in. Small cams work when placed well and people regularly take large falls on them.  Usual rules apply don't count on 1 to keep you off a ledge etc.  soft catch and more rope out helps.  ,Apr 2016,Jan 29 2020,2
2807,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,6,18, I don't have a .75 Z4 for direct comparison nor a .5 BD UL~ but in comparing a .5 Z4 to a red alien (equivalent size) and .75 BD UL~ I have a few interesting observations: 1.)  Trigger seems further back than both the aliens and UL's~ making it easier for deeper / trickier placements. 2.)  It does stiffen up a bit upon retracting the trigger...probably more firm than an X4.  Definitely more than an alien 3.)  The trigger wire is a stranded / solid combination~ which I initially grunted at...but when my wires do fray (I've owned alien evos which are notorious for fraying)~ they have typically been more up near the cam lobe and likely due to stuck placements and myself or partners nicking the wire.  The Z4 is solid more near the lobe and stranded more near the trigger 4.)  Head size is significantly smaller than the BD UL (at least the .75 size).  I know this isn't a big deal for those of you climbing in splitters~ but for us in NC I can't count the number of times when I wanted a better .3-.5 placement in a perfect pod but the head was too big (even in an irregular crack). 5.) Surface contact - definitely looks like more contact than the red alien (to me).,Apr 2014,Jan 29 2020,0
2808,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,6,19, so I just got a rack of the Z4s. First impression is they’re good..... but not great. They are not as stiff as you would hope when playing around with them. They do not come close to the stiffness of a totem when compressed. The smaller sizes are much stiffer when compressed than the larger sizes. With that being said they are a significant improvement over the X4s. That isn’t saying much. I would not write these cams of entirely as they give the impression that they are DURABLE. The construction and materials seem top notch. The double braided cable is confidence inspiring. They seem like they could stand up to a lot abuse.  Game changer....? No. 3/5,Feb 2017,Jan 29 2020,3

2885,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,16, Totems offer a few advantages over C4’s or Z4’s in that they function as a off set cam and a regular cam at the same time~ it will adjust to the crack much more effectively than any other cam.  You can also place two lobes and load just those two lobes by clipping the cam loop below those two.   Outside of the two lobe thing (which totem only suggests for aid placements)~ how is a totem better for offset placements?  The advantage of the offset is that is has two different sized cam sets to fit into a flaring or irregular crack.  The totem doesn't have that so how is it compensating?,Jun 2016,Feb 10 2020,2
2886,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,17, Outside of the two lobe thing (which totem only suggests for aid placements)~ how is a totem better for offset placements?  The advantage of the offset is that is has two different sized cam sets to fit into a flaring or irregular crack.  The totem doesn't have that so how is it compensating? Totems main advantage is that each side is loaded DIRECTLY~ as opposed to every other cam on the market which loads the stem~ which in turn loads the two sides together. So~ the independent loading of the two different sides means that an offset placement will be as equally bomber as parallel placements. This is the patent that EVERY cam manufacturer will jump on once it expires. As much as I'd like Totem to capitalize on a great invention~ the climbing world will be a safer place once everyone is allowed to build cams this way~ which they will~ becasue it is simply better.,Sep 2017,Feb 10 2020,6

You need to either take a Totem in hand and play with it and compare it to regular off sets or google for videos showing how they work for off sets.   I’ve got sets of Alien~ Metolious and X4 off sets and 9 times out of 10 I’ll choose the Totem for a flared or off set placement.   ,Apr 2012,Feb 10 2020,5
2888,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,19, Each pair of cam lobes is independent from the other set. On the same principle as using a two-lobe aid placement. So one set of lobes in a flare and one set in something more uniform means something much closer to a solid placement than something like a c4 where any of the lobes in a flare compromise the entire placement. TLDR: because the cams don’t have to be placed all uniform for the thing to work Edit: so you can have one set of lobes basically cammed all the way and the other set tipped out and it’s still a decent piece of gear.

2922,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,13, It’s not just the width~ it’s also the shape and configuration of the lobes. When it comes to tiny cams like these minute details make all the difference. For this reason~ IMO Z4’s are not a replacement for C3’s. Something I noticed: One way BD got that narrow head width was to shave the width off of the individual lobes of the Z4’s. If you compare the Z4 lobes to the X4 lobes~ there is less surface area in contact with the rock. This will focus force rather than spread it out. Not a fan. It is similar to how they saved weight with the UL Camalots’ noticeably skinny lobes especially on the smaller sizes. IMO this is not a good thing.,Jun 2001,Feb 18 2020,7
2923,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,14, You're failing to realize~ or to state~ that the C3 may have larger surface on the lobes because it's only 3 lobes vs the 4 lobes that the area is spread out over the Z4's.

Surely theres a major correlation between how abrasive a head feels on your skin vs it's holding power in rock. ffs...Ray Jardine already solved/tested this back when he first developed the cam~ and has been backed up by testing in the decades and decades since.

I bought a .75 Z4 because I wanted a double for a c4 and wanted to try the new cams. So far I really like it. I’ve placed it in a bunch of pretend placements and really liked it. It’s more flexible then a c4 but easier to place and a little bit more stiff then the only x4 I have. (.4/.5 offset) But I climbed for the first time since getting it today and only followed. I gave it to my friend who was leading but he never placed it.. so I have no real world experience with it. But just from playing with it and sticking it in rocks outside my house I really like how narrow it is and how flexible it is for horizontal placements.

My buddy placed a purple totem into a crack on his first lead the other day and didn’t extend it enough and it walked back and umbrella’d all but one lobe. I imagine it probably would have inverted if he fell on it since they’re not rated for passive placements. (But i have no idea really.) That and the price are the only pluses I see for the z4 over totems~ and the smallest sizes of course. Here’s some photos. And yes I’m an Uber Gumby~ so no need to listen to me haha. ,Feb 2017,Mar 15 2020,6

The cam held just fine and dug into the inside of the crack a bit.

I agree with you that my C3’s and Aliens are irreplaceable and I am not impressed by the Z4’s. I mostly use them aiding and for directionals~ so no~ I'm not a baller 13 gear climber. I would argue though that placing and weighting every placement means I know when a cam works and when it doesnt 100% of the time. How many whips an outing does a typical 13 climber take on gear?  I really think BD nailed the C3 except for the stem~ which is fine most of the time. Z4's are great when the placement isnt flairing.

3068,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,9,19, Totally fair.  Honestly after using a C4 .4 and a Z4 .4~ the C4 version almost seems a little ridiculous.  Like why would you really want something that stiff and that wide in such a small size?,Aug 2018,Apr 17 2020,3

3100,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,11, The cable stiffener on the Z4's is only really effective when the cam lobes are 100% retracted. The stiffening effect is easily observable in the smallest sizes because the trigger barely travels before it hits 100%. With the larger Z4's you need to mentally remind your yourself to bottom-out the trigger if you want the stiffness. This is why people are saying the cable stiffener does nothing~ they need to pull the trigger in farther. The Z4's only stiffen on a single axis (vertically in a normal placement) and the stiffener has no effect on the side to side axis in a normal placement. Fully retracting a cam trigger while placing brings other problems (stuck pieces) and it is exactly those kind of placements that you would want the stiffness for... The cable stiffener is a good idea~ the implementation on the Z4 is okay~ far from great. Overall though~ these still seem like very nice cams at a great value price point. The .5 & .75 are the gems of the series. These two sizes shine because of the dual-axle range~ narrow headwidth~ diminutive weight and size~ and the cheap MSRP.  .3 & .4 are marvels of engineering to behold. However~ the totems that overlap these sizes are better cams. Double butt~ with a good sale you could buy a 0.3 & a 0.4 Z4 for the price of a single totem. The dual axle design is a toss up here. There are huge holes in lobes. Will these cams be durable? Can the cam lobes on these sizes deform and fail? These are legitimate questions~ but I'd whip. If there wasn't the single/dual axle debate (and totems) these would be right there with the .75 & .5 as the gems of the line.  0~ .1~ and .2 Z4's are good but not noticeably better than UL Mastercams~ dragonfly's~ aliens~ C3's etc I think the Z4 add more of the same to this category~ which isn't bad but isn't exciting either. The Z4's are an upgrade from X4's because of headwidth. The #0 Z4 is pretty cool but~ personally~ I would only use it for aid.,Mar 2016,May 2 2020,14
3101,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,12, I've gotten some significant mileage in on my Z4's and have been very pleased with the 0.3 to 0.75. Yesterday on Dark Star~ there were a couple of tricky placements where a C4 0.5 was too wide~ but the Z4 nailed it. In those placements~ an orange or red Metolius would've been just off in either direction.  As mentioned above~ I've whipped 15-20' on the 0.5 and 0.75 and they're holding up just fine. I'm less impressed with the smallest sizes; the trigger pull of the ultralight Mastercams is nicer.  It's worth noting that the 0.3 and 0.4 fit slightly smaller placements than their C4 brethren by perhaps a quarter of a size. The 0.4 Z4 is right between a yellow Metolius and an 0.4 C4.  I just got some Scrotem cams~ so we'll see how the Z4's compare. ,Mar 2012,May 18 2020,12
3102,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,1,13, Can echo this. Have gotten some decent mileage on my 0.2 and a lot less mileage on the 0 and 0.1. I've fallen for the hype. I'm taking my black totem over the 0.2 10/10 times. It just feels significantly easier to get a good placement~ at least in terms of understood retraction amount of the cam in comparison to the 0.2 despite extremely similar ranges. That being said~ I love the 0.3s and up. ,Dec 2018,May 18 2020,1

3110,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,1, I just picked up a .75 and .4 z4 Camalot. I will make a update once I climb with them later this week.   my first impressions make me think of the z4 as a more usable x4 camalot. The head with is narrow~ and the stiffening structure will make it easier to place~ but by no means should I to compared to a c3.   Something that made me happy was that the plastic Z thingy is not what stiffens the cam~ it is the cable withing the plastic z thingy. The plastic is just protecting the cables from abrasion.  I wouldn't be worried about  damaging the plastic because it does not appear to have any structural component in the rigid flex system.   While the rigid flex system does work~ as expected the advertising is a bit over the top.  That said~ holding the cam makes me feel more confident in the quality and I am not worried about having the rigid flex system breaking or making the cam unusable.  As for the lobes they feel much gripper then c4 Camelots. we will see if there are issues with lobes getting stuck after I take a fall on them. PS: the dual cable stem on .3 and above are pretty sick.,Feb 2020,May 25 2020,2
3111,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,2, Usually when you are placing the super small gear you place two. For leading~ although sometimes you can place them so that they are camming as well as passive in their placement.  I bought the two smaller cams from the set. Because I have the C3s all of them except the 000 grey. ,Jun 2017,May 25 2020,0
3112,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,3, When you place them in a crack with any depth (but not buried) and weight them~ the plastic part abrades against the rock. I only own the #0 Z4~ but I've been wondering how well the plastic holds up. I saw some dudes this weekend with a rack of Z4's and asked them about this and they said the plastic component seemed to be wearing out after only a few takes on their 0.4. Contrary to the bold statement above~ they seemed to think the flex/rigid technology was indeed being compromised by this because the plastic would catch on the twisted wires and inhibit full rigidity... I was maintaining a six-foot distance at the time~ so I wasn't able to check out the cam for myself. Not saying they were right~ but I immediately thought of this thread and wanted to share their feedback.,Jun 2019,May 25 2020,2

Looking into it further~ I believe that the accordion plastic covering the cables has little to no structural component to it.  It is not being stretched or limiting motion to the stem.  I think it is a protective cover~ and designed to protect the cables while having a extremely large range of motion.,Feb 2020,May 25 2020,2
3114,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,5, Anyone used any of the offsets yet? Particularly aiding on the small sizes? I love my .2-.4 Z4’s so far~ and i’m thinking about ditching my X4/mastecam UL offsets for some Z4’s. ,Jul 2014,May 25 2020,0

3116,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,7, Something worth mentioning about the rigid-flex system (something which I don't think BD did a good job communicating in their marketing) is that it allows for a much more flexible stem.  Try it yourself: take an X4 and compare how flexible the stem is as compared to the same-size Z4.  Z4 is significantly more flexible.  What the rigid-flex system actually does is prevent it from buckling when you pull the trigger.,Oct 2017,May 25 2020,2
3117,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,8, I have the .75 and .5 Z4s. They .75 is a little less floppy than the X4~ so far I haven't really noticed a difference with the .5 compared to the X4. I also have the same size Camalots~ and all things being equal~ they're all functionally the same. I have yet to come across a placement where I would absolutely want a Z4/X4 over a C4. There are a few placements where the more flexible stem is nice to have~ but not necessary by any means.,Aug 2016,May 25 2020,0
3118,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,9, I’ve come across two key placements in the last couple days where the purple Z4 fit and the C4 didn’t because of headwidth. An orange Mastercam or purple Totem would’ve worked as well. I’d still prefer a fat C4 in Wingate.,Mar 2012,May 25 2020,3
3119,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,10, I personally would never place a C4 in a horizontal~ where X4's and Z4's look totally cozy. Sure~ the C4 would hold a fall in a but would probably be totally fucked from it. ,Jun 2016,May 26 2020,5

3123,NEW Black diamond Z4 ,2,14," I have .1-.5 Dragonflies and the .4~ .5~ .75 Z4s. The Dragonfly stem does feel ridiculously thin compared to the Z4 plastic~ though I definitely prefer the feel of its sheath. The Z4s are definitely easier to place due to the greater range and headwidth that feels narrower (though they are actually pretty close to the same). I like the headwidth-stem size ratio on the Dragonflies~ facilitates ""slotting"" some of the lobes into a more secure position. The Z4 feels more like a Totem~ where headwidth = stem width and doesn't allow for slotting really. The bottom of each Dragonfly's range is a little smaller than the Z4 equivalent.  I also think the Dragonflies just look cooler.",May 2015,May 27 2020,3

3146,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,0, I love the fall and the anticipation to winter! I'm looking to buy a climbing specific alpine pack for ice and I think I've narrowed it down to two (possibly three). I want something lightweight and designed more for climbing than approach comfort. The two I'm currently looking at are: 1. Arc'teryx Alpha FL 45 2. Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+ A close third would be the Patagonia Ascensionist series. I've owned CiloGear and their strap system & wait times aren't for me.  Nothing against Cold Cold World~ but I feel some of their technology/fabrics are a little antiquated.  I can't afford Alpine Luddites~ even though a custom rig would be dope!  I gave the Osprey Mutant 38 a hard look~ however~ I hate the fact that it has an attached hip belt.  There's a thousand reviews of the Alpha series packs~ however~ the Tupilak Packs are new this season.  Their limited release last winter got phenomenal reviews and a few people on MP appear to have one and love them. I want something that can hold a days worth of gear~ however~ pack down small enough for the actual climb ... I know - Holy Grail! The Alpha FL 45~ according to Arc'teryx~ is 33L with the extension expanding to 45L.  I love the thought of that capacity range as I feel if I don't use the extension sleeve while climbing~ the pack *should* be reasonably smaller at only 33L.  What I don't like about the Alpha FL 45 is it doesn't come with compression straps & I've heard durability issues with the bungee~ etc.  For $259~ I feel like they dropped the ball with that.  The Alpha FL 45 doesn't come with hip belt fins like the Tupilak 37+ does.  Not that it probably makes a huge difference~ but ... I use a larger~ down belay jacket for winter climbing~ so a little bigger of a climbing pack is always welcomed. I'm thinking the 30-35L range~ which includes the Tupilak 37 as~ according to Mountain Equipment~ is very easy to string when needed. What I like about the Tupilak 37+ is EVERYTHING is removable~ including any straps~ pads~ frame sheets~ tool attachments~ etc. The tool attachments appear to be a little burlier and the front daisy chain gives more options than what the Alpha FL 45 offers.  The Tupilak 37+ also offers a couple more storage pockets for organization. For anyone who owns or who has owned both~ would you prefer one of another?  Thanks! ,Mar 2011,Oct 2 2018,1
3147,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,1, Take a hard look at the BD Speed 30 as well.  It's been my go-to pack for several years on ice and rock.  Mine has worn like iron~ is super comfortable~ and can be stripped down for the climb.  It's comparable in size to the FL45...30L when packed in standard fashion and 40+ Liters expanded.  It's also worth noting you could buy the Speed 30 and Speed 22 for the price of the FL45.,Oct 2015,Oct 2 2018,5
3148,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,2, I have the older generation FL 30 before they updated the strap foam. It's honestly pretty uncomfortable with a heavy load. The tupilac looks like the hipbelt pieces are removable so you could carry a heavy load to camp or the base and then streamline for climbing. Let us know how it is if you get it!,Apr 2013,Oct 2 2018,0
3149,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,3, I used a Tupilak 37+ this year pretty extensively guiding in the Cascades.   I haven't owned an alpha FL but a number of my partners have used them.   I do think the fabric on the ME pack is quite durable.  The ice axe keepers were a little snug for petzl nomic heads but after the shock loosened up a little not a problem.    The size has been great too.   I did a two night trip with the 37+ in the the twin sisters range and it carried well.   The hip pods do shift around  a bit but nothing too bad.  All in all it's been a solid pack.  Oh and I like the pocket design with twin access points.,Mar 2008,Oct 6 2018,1
3150,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,4, I’m one of the dorks who has used the FL30~ FL45~ the Tupilak 37~ and the newer Ascensionist 30. The FL is overrated on durability. Wore lots of holes in mine with two days per week of use for a year. But it’s really light and carries pretty well for not really having hip straps. For what it’s worth I once filled my FL45 liter by liter~ and it could be closed at 36 liters without the extension collar. At 37~ some water spilled out when I closed it. The old Ascensionist packs sucked~ but the newer ones are pretty nice. Pretty durable and carry pretty well. I don’t like the closure on them though. Also don’t like strapping a rope to the top very much. The Tupilak is my favorite pack of them. Seems to be the most durable of the 3. Pocket inside is kind of funny. Hip pads work really well for such a light pack. Still wasn’t hip supportive enough for my wife. She prefers the beefy hip straps of HMG packs. The Tupilak comes with shock cord that I wasn’t smart enough to know how to thread without emailing ME (the ends come apart) Any of them is great. Want better hip support? Go with Tupilak. Want lighter rolltop? Go Arc. Want lighter sort of more traditional top? Go Ascensionist,Oct 2007,Oct 6 2018,4

3154,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,8, It’s red red. Not at all orange Cool~ thanks. Black it is! I was hoping it was more orange. Did you ever notice not having compression straps with any of your Alpha FL packs? I get Arc'teryx's is trying to save weight & keep it streamline~ but why not give us the option to just take them if we don't end up using them? It's troubling paying $260 retail for a pack without options.  Maybe it's just me ...,Mar 2011,Oct 6 2018,0
3155,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,9, Honestly I never noticed any problems with the FL not being compressed. The shock cord pulled it together ok. And the 45 does have tabs on the side to add your own straps. Get some Titan/Dyneema cord and weave it through each side as compression straps and emergency anchor cord My Tupilak was on sale at campsaver at one point for 20% off plus they had a coupon for an additional 20 off~ so deals do happen occasionally,Oct 2007,Oct 6 2018,2
3156,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,10, I have the FL30~ and added two compression straps~ and two waist belt gear loops. I feel that the top of the pack is poorly designed. With rolltop closed and drawstring cinched~ there is a pocket formed on top that will fill up with rainwater or snowmelt. stupid design. I also greatly prefer a traditional top that is easily accessed in precarious places~ like narrow ridges. I don't like digging through my pack for small items. I got it free~ so was willing to do a little custom work on it for fun.,Jul 2015,Oct 8 2018,1
3157,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,11, my biggest beef with the FL series is that the tool carrying system sags with a heavier technical tool (Nomics) Agreed that it isn't the most durable either. ,Apr 2011,Oct 8 2018,1
3158,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,12, I'm not a fan of thin shock cords in general. I replaced the shock cord on my FL with Dyneema cord. Even though I wanted to know how to thread the shock cord on the Tupilak~ I wound up not installing it. The Tupilak has both dongles and sleeves for the heads of tools. The Tupilak 37 specs at 780g with all components and 570g stripped. In reality~ the Tupilak 37 is 825g with everything except the shock cord~ and it's significantly more than 570g fully stripped.,Oct 2007,Oct 8 2018,0
3159,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,13, Another critique of the FL series: the foam support is not removable. For overnight trips I like to remove that and put my sleeping pad in its place. Brian~ how are you attaching crampons to your Tupilak~ or are you putting them inside? ,Aug 2014,Oct 8 2018,1
3160,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,14, Brian~ do you think that the 40 liter version of the Ascensionist would be a good contender against the Tupilak 37?  The ME pack looks great but holy cow is it spendy!,Mar 2015,Oct 8 2018,0
3161,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,15, Brian~ do you think that the 40 liter version of the Ascensionist would be a good contender against the Tupilak 37?  The ME pack looks great but holy cow is it spendy!  I’d say sure. Not really fond of the closure at the top of the Patagonia packs~ but it’s otherwise great. One novelty you can do with the tupilak pack is that the extension sleeve can be inverted and pushed down toward the bottom~ and it’s long enough that you can then close it down there sorta segregating a belay jacket or something at the bottom of the pack from the rest of the pack to keep it dry,Oct 2007,Oct 8 2018,0
3162,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,16, For any pack with shock cord~ I just about always put crampons on top with the rope. I hate shock cord,Oct 2007,Oct 8 2018,0

3164,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,7,18," No~ the Ascensionist rope carry does suck. I've been most successful by moving the main front strap bottom catch to the top little loop and then pulling the strap over the top of the ""brain"" of the pack and a rope and just ghetto hooking it to the haul loop.

3167,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,2,0, if you are thinking of using it as a crag bag the FL 45 is not robust enough~ you'll put major holes in it within a year if the rock you frequent is in any way rough and/or sharp. On the other hand~ its actually not as uncomfortable as you might think given the lack of padding on the straps. My main issue with it aside from tears is the hip strap constricts my stomach forcing upper chest breathing rather than belly breaths. Not a deal breaker but limits the use of the bag to shorter approaches~ I wont take it on the 15 mile-ers again. So the use of it is somewhat limited to not insanely long approaches and not cragging either. ,Jul 2009,Oct 9 2018,0
3168,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,2,1, I'm not sure how big of a pack you need but I really do enjoy my TNF Alpine 50. It's made of some bomber cordura fabric and actually holds 50L and has a solid rope closure system w/ ice tool holders. It climbs pretty well and even has an extra gear loop on the waist belt. It also keeps the weight down for being so bomber at 2lbs 9oz. ,Jan 2016,Oct 9 2018,0

Mainly I’ve tried adding a variety of shoulder strap padding to put my size reg 45L closer to a 17 inch torso. It would be handy to fashion some kind of cowl or brain to keep rain from getting into the top opening.

3172,Alpha FL 45 or Mountain Equipment Tupilak 37+?,2,5, Sean;  I put four daisy loops on the pack to allow for compression straps.

Both are nice and I'd give the Trion a slight edge over my Alpha AR. They've incorporated running style pockets on the front shoulder straps - nothing too bulky that would affect climbing~ but enough for a few hundred quick calories or small accessories. The rucksack is still fairly minimal and adaptable with burly and well-designed features. I'm still up in the air over a roll top closure though. It does help with spindrift and precip~ but takes slightly longer to access. There are a lot of good alpine packs out there and many of the differences are minor or preferential~ but I'd throw the Trion Guide into the mix as a reasonably priced rucksack. For reference~ I'd rate my 30-40L packs as follows -Patagonia Ascentionist (2017 2nd gen?): C -MEC Alpinelite (circa 2015 gen~ not the newest which I'd give a C): A- -Arc Alpha AR 35L: A -Mammut Trion Guide 38L (late 2020): A -Dyneema Cilogear Worksack 3030: B -Deuter Guide Lite: B-,Jan 2011,Jun 29 2020,0

3261,BD #7 and #8???,5,6, Merlin ain’t *CE rated.  My blue alien is rated at 6kn and I’ve taken a 15’ pendulum on it held in a shallow pocket. I’m far from worried about falling on a cam rated for 9kn let alone something that’s not “CE” rated. Aside from that large cams are not meant to be whipped on. I’m not saying that’s where you’re going with your post it just seems to be a thing people are referring to a lot lately. ,Apr 2019,Apr 4 2020,2

3264,BD #7 and #8???,5,9, Thanks for all the pictures and info by those that got them.Any chance to get a few more measurements on the VGs~ Merlin and BD?  Axle diameter~ spring wire~ and anything else. Cool that they all have design differences.  A single axle and 2 different double axle.  3 different stems~ different triggers. Maybe we will have enough numbers soon to create a comparison chart.  Weights~ costs~ size~ expansion range~ usable range and availability.  The BDs are quite a bit wider~ maybe more stable CE and UIAA mean very little if anything at all to me.  I doubt that anyone is actual testing to get 3Sigma.  That is a ton of material~ time and money.,May 2008,Apr 4 2020,0

3272,BD #7 and #8???,5,17, Anyone who thinks that the merlin is stronger than the BD 8 should probably read the BD tech report on big cam strength. TLDR: the new BD cams are way way stronger than 8kn and 5kn. But since asymmetrical placements with big cams leads to folding lobes~ BD chose a conservative rating in order to encourage solid placements. I seriously doubt that Merlin can claim the same strength when the lobes aren't perfectly even.blackdiamondequipment.com/e…  And yes the cams are 3 sigma tested to the umost degree,Feb 2016,Apr 6 2020,11

3274,BD #7 and #8???,5,19, I wonder why BD went with such a wide cam. Maybe just for rotational stability~ or maybe some other engineering reason? I know that my Merlin will often orient the stem directly out just from rope drag when I climb above it. The Merlin #8 is already a real PITA when you're trying to climb a squeeze chimney with it on your harness. I can only image the BD #7 is going to be way worse.

Initially bought it for lead soling~ but haven't got around to trying it out in that capacity.  Be careful lowering / rappelling with it.

3313,Taz Lov2 Rope Access Device~ Rope Solo?,1,16, So I played around on the patented Lead Rope Solo Simulator (a 24' extension ladder) and some alpine draws~ and I have to say the Taz device worked well with a chest bungee. I also used a rated swivel and a couple heavy quicklinks to connect to belay loop which really seems to help prevent any twists from being transmitted to the sideplates. To prevent backfeeding~ it still might be a good idea to install the occasional friction hitch or equivalent like the SP. Still a whole bunch of snow here but I'll play more on real rock as spring arrives. Preliminary opinion: might be a winner. Can't wait to get it out on some Darrington slab.

Interesting observation: it's been approved for 2 years in the comps I climb in & attend and I've yet to see anyone lower on one after a long ascent...

3320,Taz Lov2 Rope Access Device~ Rope Solo?,2,2," Does that device still lock if you accidentally grab it? I know that's something Petzl has talked about before~ since your natural instinct is to grab in front of you when you're falling so it has to guard against that. It's one of the reasons Petzl doesn't recommend the shunt for rope soloing backup. The other being you falling + if the shunt was pushed against the rock it could ""unlock"" the cam. ",Oct 2011,Jun 2 2019,0
3321,Taz Lov2 Rope Access Device~ Rope Solo?,2,3, The akimbo~ like most of the ascent/descent devices used in arboriculture collapse into a neutral position on ascent. I don’t think you could collapse it against the rock. The chest harness tending point on the amimbo is designed with a wire gate (9 o’clock to the rope in the pic) so if you go unconscious you detach from the tending point. Without this gate the device can collapse if an unconscious user flops backwards with their chest harness clipped in. I see this mode of failure as the biggest determent to this device for soloing~ and it’s annoyingly easy to detatch from the tending point unintentionally.  This device allows you to fine tune the friction the device applies via spinning the bollards closer to  or further from the rope.

3323,Taz Lov2 Rope Access Device~ Rope Solo?,2,5, Works great for top rope solo~ especially for doing laps. Curious if anyone is using it for lead rope solo. I'm currently using an Eddy for LRS~ but would like to simplify things by using the same device for both. Thinking to test it out tomorrow... ,Jun 2018,Jun 20 2020,1
3324,Taz Lov2 Rope Access Device~ Rope Solo?,2,6, How is it for rappeling between laps? Dunno where i read it but i think i heard its got a sensitive lever/lowers kind of fast compared to a grigri.,Jan 2018,Jun 20 2020,0
3325,Taz Lov2 Rope Access Device~ Rope Solo?,2,7, Works great for doing laps. The sweet spot is a fair bit smaller and more sensitive than a GG but there are things that can be done while learning it to protect yourself and slow it down till you get use to it. Some of it probably has to do with the rope it is paired with . I'm currently writing a blog post review of the Lov2 and should have it done by early next week.

3336,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,0, I'm buying my first trad rack and don't know if it's better to get a set of friends~ C4s~ or one set each. From comparing the two they both feel insanely similar. Anything I should be aware of for a beginner trad climber? For context~ I'll be climbing all over Utah mainly. Thanks!,Oct 2018,Jun 22 2020,0
3337,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,1, IMO the Friends used to be the better choice because they were lighter~ but since BD redesigned the C4s last year~ I think it basically boils down to whether you like the extendable sling or not. They are nearly identical besides that.,Sep 2014,Jun 22 2020,2
3338,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,2," I have one set of each~ since WC Friends were on sale locally. The sizes are a wee bit different~ especially the #2 friend being larger to make the range more continuous versus the C4s.  I only notice looking at Camparison~ honestly~ in real life both #2s are ""perfect hand jam"" size for me.  I have no real opinion on either being ""better"" in any subjective way~ honestly - the extendo sling can be handy when you need just a tiny bit of extension~ but otherwise they both perform identically in my experience. I'll second that the old C4s were noticeably heavier~ but now C4s and friends are really close in weight.",Sep 2018,Jun 22 2020,2
3339,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,3, I have a Frakenrack and honestly don't see the differences between the brands being a big enough differentiator to sway me one way or the other.  I don't have and WC~ but I do have BD C4s of various vintages and DMMs for double axel cams and Aliens and Metolious cams in the smaller sizes. Having an extendable sling is useful at times~ but not to the point where I wouldn't rack a BD without it.  I have BD cams with and without a thumb loop (I don't aid climb) so not having a loop on the DMMs wasn't a deal breaker.  I would buy a single rack of whatever is the less expensive option from .5 to #2 or 3 (BD equivalent) and then start augmenting with other options.  I like the smaller Met cams~ and really like the TCUs~ plus they are cheaper.  In the smaller sizes~ you won't lose as much range with a single axle.  I actually prefer the red Alien #1 over the 0.5 BD.  I couldn't really say why~ but I do.  I also love X4s if you can still find them The one thing I do~ however~ is rack everything on biners in the BD color scheme.  So the red Alien goes on a purple biner~ the yellow TCU goes on a silver biner...,Jun 2014,Jun 22 2020,1
3340,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,4, Get the WC~ less (known to me) company foibles~ and the thumb loop is still steel so in theory they should last longer outside being reslung.,Apr 2018,Jun 22 2020,1
3341,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,5, Whichever is cheaper. Both are quality~ the extendable sling is small potatoes for most people. I'm torn on the sling~ since its kinda a pita to clip both strands sometimes compared to the BD sling. ,Mar 2018,Jun 22 2020,2
3342,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,6, Friends have the extendable sling which is nice,May 2010,Jun 22 2020,1
3343,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,7, BD C4 is slightly more durable and has a slightly stiffer stem(not rigid). I have friedns but have climbed on BD C4 and if you are getting C4 any thing smaller than BD #1 or equivalent you should get the new BD Z4 b/c for the couple extra bucks the head width will make them go everywhere! They are currently my favorite piece of gear on my rack. ,May 2020,Jun 22 2020,1
3344,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,8, WC friends also have wider~ non-anodized lobes that walk less. Normal C4s don't have this~ but Ultralight C4s produced in 2020 have sandblasted lobes for similar results,Sep 2014,Jun 22 2020,1
3345,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,9, Eventualy you'll want a double rack. I regret getting doubles of BD C4s (they were so cheap with sales and active junky) wish I'd gotten a single rack for Bds and then a rack of friends. I now own a few friends and love them! ,Oct 2016,Jun 22 2020,1
3346,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,10, Neither. Get totems.,Nov 2010,Jun 22 2020,5
3347,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,11, The extendable slings on the friends is next to useless in my opinion. Less extension than the shortest quickdraws and certainly not worth the hassle they will give your second. I have dragons and friends and if I could switch one I would take the new c4s over WC friends. ,Jun 2016,Jun 22 2020,0
3348,WC Friends or BD C4s?,1,12, Yep I got friends a year ago on a 50%off sale and I now wish that they had had totems that were on sale,May 2020,Jun 22 2020,0

You can always buy them later and add them in. There are still 1000s of problems without them~ including all of the moderates. If you (or others using the wall) want harder problems~ though~ the yellow holds are worthwhile. Savings: $220.

Re: Additional holds/not Moonboard holds~ we added an additional 5x12 t-nut grid between the Moonboard t-nut grid for an additional 180 t-nuts. We've got it setup to use a lot of these additional t-nuts with juggier holds for warm-ups/easier-than-V4 problems. Occasionally one or two of the extra holds get in the way of a Moonboard problem so we take the hold off. So long as you don't add huge holds in the extra spots~ it's generally not a problem.  I didn't track the cost because I didn't want to know just how much we ended up spending.   ",Oct 2005,Mar 18 2018,2

3378,DIY Moonboard Cost Estimate Spreadsheet,2,8, The other big cost factor you haven't considered is the padding underneath the Moon board.  Padding that can cover a 10' x 12' region can cost well over $1000 depending on the quality of padding you choose.  I just finished building a Moon board and now I'm trying to figure out a good solution.  For the moment~ I've borrowed a bunch of crash pads from friends~ but it would be nice to have a better long term solution.  Preferably pads that can velcro together so there aren't any ankle-destroying gaps anywhere.   The custom Moon board padding on their website will run you about $4~220 right now.  https://moonclimbing.com/freestanding-moonboard-1.html Asana climbing sells drag pads that velcro together~ but you'd probably need 4 of them and they cost $490 each.  https://asanaclimbing.com/collections/gym-pads/products/drag-pad If anyone on here has a good (and economical) solution I'm all ears.   ,Apr 2013,Mar 21 2018,1

3381,DIY Moonboard Cost Estimate Spreadsheet,2,11, Hobie~ I trained for two years on a moonboard with no led system. One quickly gets used to remembering the moves and therefor the only time I really miss the leds’ is when doing 4x4s or other volume work. The nature of hard bouldering typically involves repetitive work of a certain problem~ eliminating the need for the costly led system.  Also~ the yellow holds aren’t as bad as some say. I really like them~ even on the steep wall. The nice thing about these holds is that you tend to pop off before injury- it’s just that steep. My $.02,Sep 2007,Sep 19 2019,2

3388,DIY Moonboard Cost Estimate Spreadsheet,2,18, Re: Additional holds/not Moonboard holds~ we added an additional 5x12 t-nut grid between the Moonboard t-nut grid for an additional 180 t-nuts. We've got it setup to use a lot of these additional t-nuts with juggier holds for warm-ups/easier-than-V4 problems. Occasionally one or two of the extra holds get in the way of a Moonboard problem so we take the hold off. So long as you don't add huge holds in the extra spots~ it's generally not a problem.  I didn't track the cost because I didn't want to know just how much we ended up spending.    ,Oct 2010,Apr 2 2020,0

Well looking at them for me and was curious how yours ended up as a PNWer who would build outside too. Curious how you designed it and what your cost estimate was if that isn't too personal. Hi Corey. I just started the build. I'm not a skilled carpenter so I'm trying to take my time to make sure I get things mostly right. So far I have painted all the lumber and installed the t-nuts on all panels. When completed~ it will consist of a standard 40-degree Moonboard with an attached 15-degree spray wall that is 12ft tall by 4ft wide (i.e.~ 1.5 plywood sheets) and a triangular panel that covers the 25-degree gap between the two walls. The structure will be freestanding using a design that is similar to this: youtube.com/watch?v=nt82RQE… . I will also be adding a roof using polycarbonate roofing panels. I don't have any pictures to share yet~ but I will post them in the next few weeks as the frame is assembled. I purchased high quality ACX plywood at ~$65 / sheet and then primed and painted each sheet with an enamel that should hold up to being kicked etc. I am using fir 2x6s and 2x4s for the frame and primed and painted using an exterior acrylic paint. I put two coats on everything~ including the edges/ends where the lumber is especially vulnerable to water absorption (so I'm told). For the t-nuts and bolts~ I went with a combination of Escape's industrial stainless t-nuts/stainless bolts and Atomik's stainless t-nuts/bolts. I would have used Escape's t-nuts for the entire wall but they ran out and last I checked they didn't expect to have more until mid-July or so. I purchased the yellow~ white~ and black Moonboard hold sets. I have received the black set after 9 weeks and I'm still waiting for the yellow and white. It's been 10 weeks. For the spray wall~ I purchased a 100-pack assortment from Atomik holds. I'll buy more once I get a feel for how I want to customize the spray wall. Approximate expenses so far: 1. Mooboard holds: $950~ including shipping 2. Atomik holds~ 100 pack: $410 + shipping (maybe $35~ can't remember) 3. Escape industrial t-nuts~ 200ct: $175 4. Atomik stainless steel t-nuts~ 100ct: $100 5. Escape stainless steel bolts~ 175 ct: $165 6. Atomik stainless steel bolts~ 100ct: $110 7. ACX Plywood~ x 7 sheets: $450 8. Fir 12' 2x6s~ x 25: $310 9. Fir 12' 2x4s~ x 2:  $17 10. Stainless steel wood screws~ 200ct: $6 11. Joist connectors (variety of Ts~ 90 deg.~ & plates): $50 12. Paint (1 gallon wood primer; 1 gallon enamel; 2 gallons exterior acrylic): $325 That puts the total at just over $3~000. That doesn't include any tools you might need: drill~ impact driver~ circular saw~ mitre saw~ clamps~ drill bit guide have all been helpful so far. I also still need to purchase the polycarbonate roof panels~ but those are relatively inexpensive. Typically~ it seems that folks build a Moonboard for about $2~000 depending on whether or not they install LEDs. However~ the cost of adding the extra spray wall and buying materials to withstand rain (paint~ stainless hardware~ ACX ply) added an extra $1~000. Feel free to follow up with any questions. I'll update with some pics once this thing starts to take form.,Mar 2006,Jun 22 2020,0

3497,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,0," I'm in WA state and climb / scramble / mountaineer locally.   For the past few years I've been very happy with a quiver of footwear consisting of Brooks Cascadia for hiking / long trail miles / snow-free stuff~ and the Five Ten Camp Four for schwackier / slighthly snowier / slightly steeper objectives (I have Scarpa Charmoz for materially snowier springtime / winter stuff).  I'm seeking a replacement for my worn out Five Ten Camp Fours.  What I'd like:  - leather uppers~ ideally not Gore Tex - sole that is on the stiffer side  - ""Supportive"":  willing to trade off 5th class performance in favor of comfort for long miles and boulder fields I'm not wedded to the marketing category of ""approach shoe"". Things I'm considering: La Sportiva TX4 La Sportiva TX Guide (maybe not sufficiently ""diversified away"" from my Cascadias ) Scarpa Zen Pro Scarpa Mescalito Salewa MTN Trainer I'd love to hear from prior fans of the Camp Four about what they're using these days.",Jan 2013,May 20 2020,0
3498,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,1, I used the Camp 4 for years. Very supportive and durable~ just never thst comfortable. Tried on a pair of the Scarpa Zen and still not very comfortable. Didn't buy them. Got a pair of Scarpa Crux. Ah~ finally comfort! Not as stiff~ probably not as durable~ but...comfortable!

3503,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,6, A few years ago I had a pair of Salewa MTN Trainers and ended up getting rid of them. They are a solid~ well-made shoe~ but have two big downsides: They are incredibly narrow in the toe box and will likely feel very uncomfortable if you like the fit of 5.10 shoes.  I would also say that the sole is too rigid.  They had almost no flex walking downhill and I ended up with very sore feet at the end of the day.  The sole was so rigid that they felt more like a low cut mountaineering boot.  I used them on for approaches in the Tetons for a 3-week trip and then got rid of them as soon as I got back from Wyoming.  I had originally got them to pair with aluminum crampons on an attempt at the grand traverse.  I assumed they would handle well with light crampons because of the rigid sole~ but the drawbacks of the rigidity when hiking outweighed that~ especially since I do a lot more hiking in approach shoes than crossing crampon necessary snowfields in approach shoes. ,May 2011,May 22 2020,0
3504,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,7, Thanks~ this is the kind of feedback I'm seeking.   I fondled a pair of Garmont Dragontails and it was the same thing~ just seemed like a 3-season mountain boot cut off below the ankle.  ,Jan 2013,May 22 2020,0
3505,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,8, Switched to Scarpa Zen Pro~ love them.

3506,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,9, I used to like the Scarpa Zen~ but when they changed to the Zen pro they made the heel more shallow~ which really bugs my feet (haglunds deformities).  I have switched over the TX4 and absolutely love them.,Dec 2004,May 22 2020,0
3507,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,10, You might like the LaSportiva TX5s. They’re a little more boot-like without going as far as the Trangos~ but still have sticky rubber. I basically lived in them the last couple of years in Alaska plus traveling to jungles and the like for work~ unless I needed something beefier - Xtra Tufs or Nepals~ usually.  I prefer the TX Guides for climbing and running~ but they’re not as water resistant and don’t have the same ankle support. ,May 2016,May 22 2020,0
3508,Replacement for Five Ten Camp Four Approach Shoe - Seeking  Something Similarly Burly,1,11, I've been scrambling and climbing in my TX Guides for nearly a month now and they are unbelievable. It's like they've blended the climbing of a TX2 and the comfort of the Bushido. Perfect for long days including low fifth class solos. I've also climbed up to 5.8 in these bad boys. Totally worth the price. You'll also look like a fancy euro.  ,Nov 2016,Jun 22 2020,0
3509,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,0, Has anyone has actually gotten their hands on the edelrid swift protect pro 8.9?

Looking mainly for insights from those with real-world experience with it~ specifically in the alpine. What are your perceptions on durability/handling/tangling/etc? ,Feb 2015,Apr 10 2020,1
3510,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,1, I’m sure if it is as durable as they claim it’ll be great. Lightweight and durability are normally two contradictory things.  I haven’t used this rope but I have climbed with 9mm ropes quite a bit. The weight savings is a big advantage on longer routes. If this rope wasn’t so expensive I’d probably buy one and try it out. ,Feb 2017,Apr 10 2020,0

3512,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,3, Following.   I'm on my 4th Edelrid Swift at the moment. The first three had been surprisingly durable given how scary thin they are. I've used them for everything from projecting sport climbs to long routes in the mountains without too much issue other than the psychological leap I've had to make to push my limits on such a thin cord. They've held up better than expected (I try to keep my expectations conservative for a rope like this).   However~ my current~ and nearly new~ Swift developed a horrible and inexplicable core shot during a seemingly casual rappel: I rapped~ everything was fine. My partner rapped and slammed on the brakes about halfway down: huge coreshot/complete shredding of the sheath. No obvious cause but the rope was ruined. I'd never seen anything like it in two decades of climbing.    Prior to this incident I had thought the new Protect (Aramid fiber) version would give me added peace of mind and any increase in longevity would be a bonus. Since the incident~ my feelings about the Swift are a bit more complicated... but I think I would probably not buy another one unless it was the new Protect version...    I'm eager to hear some long term reports.,Jun 2001,Jun 15 2020,1

3514,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,5, I’ve used it 3 or 4 times in the alpine and in the black.  Probably logged 30 or so pitches.  No complaints~ great rope.  No falls thus far and it’s hard to comment on durability this early.,Oct 2017,Jun 15 2020,1
3515,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,6, I recently got one and have done a few multi-pitch days with it so far. It handles nicely and works well with various belay devices (tested with grigri 2~ Edelrid Gigajul and ATC). It's obviously light and thin~ but it doesn't feel so thin that I'm worried about it~ especially because of the extra cut resistance. Already took a decent whipper on it as well~ nice soft catch. This rope replaces my Mammut revelation (9.2) and I like this Edelrid much better. It is on the stiff side (which I personally prefer).,May 2017,Jun 20 2020,1
3516,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,7, I got mine and I am taking it out tomorrow!,Feb 2006,Jun 20 2020,1
3517,Edelrid Swift Protect Pro 8.9 - out in the wild? (aramid sheath),1,8, The edelrid swift protect pro rope seems fine.  The rope is stiffer than my mammut serenity.  It feels a little different~ as if the dry coating or aramid fibers have a different feel.  The rope also transmits sounds which was especially noticeable with a weird humming sound while my partner was rappelling.  It kinda sounded like there was a bird in a crack near me but it was the rope.     I used a beal escaper to rappel and the rope seemed springier than the serenity when pulling/tugging on the rope to get the escaper to release.  This is probably an advantage.  The sheath has a tighter weave and seemed to pick up fewer cactus needles than the serenity.  Maybe this is because it is new.  This is an advantage for sure. :) So lots of minor difference none of which really effect anything important and will certainly be considered normal as I use the rope more.  No complaints.,Feb 2006,Jun 22 2020,1
3518,Grivel spacer bar clip fix?,1,0, Hi all~ Long story but I managed to bend that metal spacer bar flange on my pair of Grivel 12 point crampons so that it now springs up instead of exerting pressure down down- because of this the pin doesn’t enter the spacer bar and secure it in place. The flange is held onto the frame with pop rivets. The only way to fix this seems to be to remove the flange and fix the spacer bar in place with a bolt/nut. A buddy of mine says he saw this done in a video. Does anyone have experience with doing this? Seems like a straight forward fix with a hacksaw.,May 2020,Jun 21 2020,0

3552,Adjustable angle on a woodie,1,0, I built a home bouldering wall back in April like so many other climbers have done. However~ I added one cool feature which I haven't seen to many people do. The angle of the wall is fully adjustable from 20-45 degrees thanks to two electric-powered winches that you can operate via remote control. If anyone wants to bounce some ideas off me for their own home wall or if you want some help building your own feel free to message me!  Happy Climbing,Apr 2018,Jun 20 2020,3

3555,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,0, Hello. I am interested in thoughts/suggestions on footwear for a specific application - say My partner and I are doing a multi pitch trad climb that will take most of the day~ with several miles of trails in~ topping out~ then taking a descent trail (but it could be any application where you aren’t stashing stuff at the base and rapping straight back to it). So~ the non-climbing shoes are going up with you~ either clipped to the rack or stuffed into the follower’s backpack~ along with whatever else you need for the day. A sturdy approach shoe is nice for the hike in~ but then becomes extra bulk and weight on the wall. I was thinking a minimalist running shoe might provide a nice balance of foot protection and traction~ while being able to squish down in a pack. Durability and climbing usefulness not a priority in this application. ,Sep 2016,Jun 20 2020,1
3556,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,1, 5.10 Approach Pro were nice for this. Now La Sportiva TX2s seem to be a favorite. How you balance weight and support / cushion is up to you and could vary quite a bit between approaches. Have a quiver of shoes to choose from at home. ( buy more shoes ),Aug 2019,Jun 20 2020,2
3557,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,2, Merrell Trail Gloves are perfect. Super light and compact. I've done 30k+ trail runs in them~ climbed the OS on the Grand solo and wear them around town. Adjust cushioning with sock weight (I'm mostly in them sockless though).,Aug 2019,Jun 20 2020,2
3558,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,3, If the approach and descent don't involve anything 4th or 5th class~ any pair of sneakers is fine. If there are a few sections of sketchiness where some sticky rubber would be beneficial~ five tennies or equivalent are really nice.,Jul 2019,Jun 20 2020,1
3559,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,4, La Sportiva running shoes.,Feb 2003,Jun 20 2020,2
3560,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,5, What is the difference in weight between a lightweight runner/approach shoe and the heavier one? A pound?  Doesn't seem like a lighter shoe would make that much difference~ no matter how hard you climb. Lose five pounds off your gut (that applies to me!),Nov 2009,Jun 20 2020,0
3561,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,6, A beer! So yeah~ diff. of bringing an extra beer or not. #dothemath,Jan 2014,Jun 20 2020,3
3562,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,7, I'll take a pound savings on my feet on a long approach/decent and clipped to my harness on multipitch pretty much any time. Compactness is as or more important. Once you get used to it and build up a little foot strength~ there isn't much of a drawback of lightweight minimal-ish shoes. My experience (mostly rocky mountain trail running and low 5th class peak bagging) with La Sportiva shoes is that they are a very poor value. Uppers are very easily degraded when scraping against rocks~ the inner fabric around the heel counter wears very quickly. The soles wear very fast and aren't that much stickier than non-sticky-specific shoes. I'd say I get 1/4 to 1/3 the milage (hiking/running/scrambling/approach) in La Sportivas than I do in Trail Gloves or Altras. And they are expensive. If I were sponsored~ sure... In addition to the Trail Gloves~ Altra shoes are amazing. Forefoot is wide and not great for edging~ and soles aren't super sticky~ but they last a long time and are great for stability and moving fast. Smearing is fine. Most are zero-drop. Had old Altra Superiors and a did the Grand 4 times in them (OS thrice and Exum once) and many long trail runs in a single pair~ until my big toes literally were poking through the soles. Altra has a new trail/approach shoe now that I'd love to try.,Aug 2019,Jun 20 2020,1
3563,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,8, I'm pretty happy with my five ten guide tennies. I haven't done a route with more than 3 pitches and I haven't done more than 2 miles or so hike in~ but the feel sturdy~ stable~ and comfortable for steep and rocky hikes and also for climbing. I did a 5.6 crack climb in mine just last weekend. ,Oct 2018,Jun 20 2020,0
3564,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,9, La Sportiva TX2 excel at this very application. They would be my 1st choice. For a lighter weight shoe that doesn't hike as well~ check out Evolv Cruiser Classic. They are pretty much Tom's w/ sticky rubber. The perfect shoe for Squamish where approaches and descents are relatively small.https://www.sportiva.com/tx2.html TX2's climb REALLY well too. I don't think I've ever had a better climbing approach shoe. They are on the snug fitting size and find myself sizing 0.5 size up.,Apr 2009,Jun 20 2020,1
3565,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,10, Thanks for all the suggestions. I wasn’t familiar with the TX2s~ they look pretty ideal. the evolv cruisers and the trail gloves might do the trick for less $ Though.  A pound of weight can make a difference on a long climb (Wouldn’t you rather have a pound more water instead??)~ but for me it’s more about the bulkiness of normal sneakers and/or approach shoes - stealing precious backpack space or clanging around on your harness getting in the way. ,Sep 2016,Jun 20 2020,0
3566,Approach footwear for top-out routes,1,11, For the wide feet folks I was looking at the Scarpa Crux air. Tx2s are too narrow for me sadly ,Apr 2016,Jun 20 2020,0
3567,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,0, My gym has us clip a bigass autolocking carabineer~ rather than tie in~ for the top ropes. It's attached to a figure eight tied in the rope. Now and then~ there's a decided click while climbing~ when the locking mechanism pops back where it's supposed to be. It can only make this noise when it is pushed and twisted~ then released.  This happened a few times at an earlier point~ when I had a big gun harness~ at my old gym with the same setup. That harness had two super burly belay loops. I'm in a CAMP Jasper now~ which is a single belay loop~ but also burly. I was wondering if this somehow happens when the carabineer is rattling up and down and engaging with the burly belay loop? As soon as it's weighted (or slack pulled tight enough)~ it clicks back. I haven't heard of others having this happen~ so I assume it's the harness~ and perhaps also how short I am? Maybe some other harness part? Anyway~ it's sorta disconcerting. I think it's still a one in a bazillion chance it could get unclipped entirely~ but I'm curious if you guys have ideas on what's going on and if I should do anything. New equipment~ not stuck carabineers~ and yes I always check they're locked. Thanks! Best~ Helen,Aug 2015,Jun 19 2020,0
3568,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,1, They sure can. I wouldn’t blame your burly belay loop~ as you move your hips up and down the top or bottom edge of the gate can catch your belay loop or wall or hold,Oct 2017,Jun 19 2020,0
3569,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,2, Sounds like a twist-lock?  If so~ I don't trust them for this reason in addition to the risk on rappel where the rope may rub the locking mechanism enough to twist it open.  Admittedly a low risk but not encouraging none the less.,Oct 2018,Jun 19 2020,2
3570,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,3, These are similar to what you'd have on an auto belay~ except that's always got tension on it from the cable.,Aug 2015,Jun 19 2020,0
3571,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,4, User error or lack of checking~ check twice~ then check again. Once you let go of the gate~ you assume it will shut completely cuz why wouldn't it? It's mechanical so dust~ chalk~ belay loop etc. might foil your plans for safety. Extra precaution is never wasted.  Happy climbing.,Apr 2019,Jun 19 2020,3
3572,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,5, Hopefully it's a triple action locker and if so I'd think you should be ok. I do maintenance on them and I've never had one do anything weird but I sure as hell check them a couple times as I climb. The real risk from autobelays is forgetting to even clip in so if you avoid that fate you should be fine.,Feb 2017,Jun 19 2020,2

3575,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,8, Hmm~ I can't say whats happening based on your description~ but the gym near me also has captive-eye triple locker steels pre-tied on every toprope. I went in one day and they had switched it all~ no more tying in. I guess they got tired of belay testing people. I honestly think it's a really good business decision. I set topropes with 1 steel ansi triple locker as a masterpoint pretty often. I think the idea that a burly triple locker (slide~ twist~ open) will open unexpectedly as astronomical. Btw is it a captive eye carabiner like this that's impossible to crossload? This is what my gym has on all the topropes. If it's just a regular carabiner with a figure 8~ I think the change of crossloading~ although small~ is too high for it to be considered a safe primary connection for constant unmonitored use.,Jun 2019,Jun 19 2020,1
3576,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,9, Hopefully it’s a triple-action autolocker~ a simple twist-lock will open even easier than a screwgate. Things you can do to help mitigate the risk: always double-check that it has fully closed and locked~ orient the gate away from you when applicable*~ and ask your belayer to keep slight tension on the rope as much as possible to keep it oriented. (unless you’re lead climbing~ but then you should definitely not be lead climbing on this set-up) *some harnesses~ particularly those intended for camps~ gym rentals~ ropes courses~ etc that are more likely to use a clip-in than a tie-in~ have a horizontally oriented belay/clip-in loop~ in this case you should orient the biner gate out~ so the gate won’t be able to rub against you. If you’re using your own climbing harness~ it most likely has a vertically oriented gear loop~ meaning the clip-in biner gate will face either left or right and orientation doesn’t matter.,Apr 2010,Jun 19 2020,1
3577,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,10, So no belay test to tie in but a belay test to belay?,May 2020,Jun 19 2020,0
3578,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,11, So no belay test to tie in but a belay test to belay? Oh yeah lol~ there's still a belay test~ you just don't need to tie the knot? I also bet there was a miniscule safety decision that any accident that happened would likely be the result of a mistied knot.,Jun 2019,Jun 19 2020,0
3579,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,12, I met a nice young woman~ a Pilates teacher~ who wanted to learn to climb. Her time was limited so I decided to get her started in a local gym. Using a set-up in my garage I taught her what she needed to know to pass her basic top-rope belay test. We went to the gym. As she set up for the test she did perfectly~ just what I’d taught her. But our test boy didn’t approve when she anchored to the mat with one locker~ and to her belay device with another. “It’s best to keep it simple~ we’d prefer that you use one ‘biner instead of two.” I interceded. “Why would you have her do something in the gym which is unwise outside?” He gave me a blank stare. “Let’s say I’m leading above Romi here~ and I come upon a loose flake. She’s on the ground anchored to a tree root~ and belaying from the same ‘biner. I yell down to her to move out to the side in case the flake peels off. But she can’t release herself from the anchor without unlocking and opening the belay ‘biner…” Why do gyms teach practices which are not considered to be acceptable in real climbing?? Out of doors one would never~ ever clip to a knot in the end of the rope with any kind of carabiner. It’s called tying in for a reason.,Apr 2004,Jun 19 2020,6

3585,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,18, It’s hard to say what is the clinking sound that you are hearing. The clip-in setup is used with autobelays~ I’ve seen this sort of thing done at some comps~ and I’ve seen couple gyms with the setup you describe~ too~ when visiting random cities. Though not in a while.  I think this is safe enough~ and I’ve even done it myself a few times when I was trying to do laps with short rest intervals~ because that was the only way to keep changeover time low~ so my partner and I could both do the laps. But I think it is absolutely idiotic to have this setup as a default gym setup~ and I would not want to climb in a gym with this kind of setup. ,Mar 2011,Jun 20 2020,0
3586,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,19, All the TR’a at our local gyms use auto lockers to tie in.,Dec 2009,Jun 20 2020,0
3587,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,1,20, Difficult to say - you did not provide information about auto-locker that is used in your gym. Even a cell phone photo would work.

3588,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,2,0, Yes~ this~ or the equivalent. Super burly. Push first~ then twist to unlock. ,Aug 2015,Jun 20 2020,1
3589,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,2,1, For toproping~ clipping in with a big steel triple locker is just as safe as tying in. Both methods have a zero probability of failing when done properly. Clipping is far less likely to be done improperly~ that's why many gyms require it. The reason clipping is never done outside is that no one wants to carry or climb with a big steel triple locker. Edit: Good points about lowering off sport routes~ Helen.,Jul 2019,Jun 20 2020,0
3590,Can autolocking carabiners get unlocked and unclipped?,2,2," I didn't say or mean ""you should never clip into a knot with a carabiner""~ I do it all the time. I'm saying that any type of free climbing where your are attached with a single locker that is allowed to dangle and move~ is pushing right up against the risks that captive eye triple lockers exist to address. Free climbing on a single regular locker at the harness is like toproping with a single locker at the masterpoint. Lots of people do it~ but it's not ideal. For midline attachments you can use 2 lockers. But again~ I don't subscribe to the always and never school of roping~ anyone can do whatever they want. I say free climbing specifically~ but I mean if there is a free fall risk. For rappelling and cleaning~ where you are constantly and predictably weighting the connection~ these risks are managed.",Jun 2019,Jun 20 2020,0

3659,hexes are goody style,3,10," Hexes are an epicureanism...""Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest~ sustainable pleasure in the form of a state of ataraxia (tranquility and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of bodily pain) through knowledge of the workings of the world and limiting desires"" Hexes~ when placed in their most stable configuration~ form a pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality i.e.  Quality(partially owing to their design and interaction with rock) that allows one to climb KNOWING they have placed the most bomber piece of gear that can be had. This transforms the climbing from one of struggle and despair to one of being able to flow up the rock in a state of harmony and inner peace. Pirsig of course explained it best: Quality~"" or ""value~"" cannot be defined because it empirically precedes any intellectual construction of it~ namely due to the fact that quality exists always as a perceptual experience before it is ever thought of descriptively or academically. Quality is the ""knife-edge"" of experience~ found only in the present~ known or at least potentially accessible to all of ""us"" (cf. Plato's Phaedrus~ 258d). Equating it with the Tao~ Quality is the fundamental force in the universe stimulating everything from atoms to animals to evolve and incorporate ever greater levels of Quality. According to the Metaphysics of Quality~ everything (including ideas~ and matter) is a product and a result of Quality. From Anthony Watt's article on Pirsig 2017:So instead of dividing everything into subjects and objects~ Pirsig divides reality into Dynamic Quality (this is capitalised deliberately) and static quality. ‘Dynamic Quality’ is the term he gives to the continually changing flux of immediately-experienced reality~ while ‘static quality’ refers to any concept abstracted from this flux. The term ‘Dynamic’ indicates something not fixed or determinate~ which means that Dynamic Quality cannot be defined~ and therefore a true understanding of it can only be given directly in experience. As Herbert Günther says in his book Philosophy & Psychology in the Abidharma (1957)~ “The Ultimate~ in Buddhism~ is something knowable~ though not known by theory or discursive method~ but by direct experience” (p.235). In other words~ the Buddha can’t tell you what Dynamic Quality is~ but he can point a way so that you can experience it for yourself~ and then you might understand.

3664,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,0, I want a long draw (say 2m long) where it is prehung on a bolt 2m overhead.  You clip the rope through the biner on the draw~ then do something(?) and the draw retracts up to the bolt 2m higher and assume a normal length (10cm or whatever) with normal strength at that length.The motivation here: some clips are scary/impossible through hard sections on a sport route~ and this would allow clipping from a low/good hold and allow you to bust through a crux without stopping.What might work: although klunky~ imagine a microtraxion and a 2m piece of static rope.  The micro is on a bungee and held down by a latch (say~ a fifi on a lower bolt). You clip through a biner on the micro~ release the bungee and the micro slides 2m up the static rope to create an overhead anchor point.  The above idea is probably too klunky to work in practice~ but something better engineered could be used?  You gear specialists out there have any ideas?,Oct 2016,Jun 15 2020,2

3678,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,1,14," Sorry I wasn't super clear in the OP.Imagine this: you're hanging on a jug at bolt 5.  You clip bolt 5.  You now have a 14-move crux sequence where there's no way you can let go to clip bolt 6~ yet bolt 6 is in the middle of the sequence.  You cannot skip bolt 6 since you will deck if you fall above bolt 6.   So now~ imagine this: you are hanging on a jug at bolt 5~ which is clipped.  A retractable draw is also within reach~ attached to bolt 6.  You clip that as well~ and unlatch the draw.  It zips up to bolt 6~ so you are now free to climb through the 14-move crux and the fall is safe. A stick clip is too ungainly to allow you to maneuver with one hand without weighting the rope.  I want something that works within a few seconds and can be operated with one hand. I want to design such a system.  I have something that will work but it's ugly and overly complicated.  And please don't say ""there are no climbs like this."" There are a lot of climbs like this...

Once you're out of that range~ a string could be pulled by the belayer to extend the draw to reduce the rope drag over the ledge. I think your design would be much more complicated than mine. You could just have a releasable buckle for mine~ where as you would need a retractable pull cord/dog bone that remains fully rated when retracted. Sounds difficult to make~ but also sounds like itd end up being extremely expensive to buy as a consumer.  My first thought was some sort of crank~ but it would have to be spring loaded to snap up by itself.

3702,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,2,17, Everyone telling me to just work on my lock-off strength: this isn't for me.  I haven't yet been on a climb where I couldn't make the clips (though on a few climbs I've struggled to clip the chains!). This was a discussion with my (much stronger) partner who's working routes I'll never touch and he's on a project where he has to skip 2 bolts through a long PE crux with ground-fall potential at the end.  We were discussing ways to make it safe.  You can't TR this climb: there's a cliff behind you and you'd splat. During this discussion he mentioned Ondra's prediction about the future of climbing.  And I started thinking about solutions for the route my partner is on.  It's a fun engineering problem and may even get used at some point... climbers have done crazier stuff to get up routes. --- I'm just imagining an Ondra interview:Interviewer: So what do you think is the next step in the progression of hard climbing?Ondra: Well~ the clips start to become the crux~ so there will have to be a way to eliminate the clips while keeping things safe.Interviewer: Well~ I just checked MP and they said to work on your lock-off strength.

3703,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,2,18, First off~ If I saw someone futtzing around with this maneuver at the crag~ I would prolly laugh. At this point just TR the climb or get strong enough to clip during the crux. In a way~ i would say any sort of way-to-involved gear shenanigans invalidates the send That said~ I think the best option would be to prerig an atc guide or grigri to the bolt with 4 meters of static rope. Pull the rope through to the middle so that 2 meters is through on the climbers side and 2 meters is through on the belay side. Tie a knot in the belayerside~ and tie a knot and put a caribiner on the climbers side. Once at the clipping stance prior to the crux~ clip the lead rope to the prerigged carabiner~ and then pull on the belayers side of the prerigged rope until the carabiner is close to the prerigged device. Probably should use a non cross loading biner to attach the device to the bolt~ and watch out for slippage/ uncamming if you use a grigri.,Mar 2014,Jun 15 2020,2

3717,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,3,12," Or off the shelf: Following the at a jug @ bolt 5~ crux bolt 5 through above bolt 6 scenario.  Tie figure 8 at the end of a 2ed rope. Clip a biner to figure 8 at end of rope2. Thread through GriGri or WC Revo with the figure-8/Biner on the climber side. Pull approx 2M rope through GriGri. Hang set up GriGri (with rope 2) from bolt 6. Now you have a Biner at ""Climbers"" end of rope2 hanging 2m below bolt 6 (thus at/even with bolt 5)~ and threaded up through GriGri hanging from bolt 6. As you climb clip 1-5 normally. after clipping 5 but while still at jug clip rope1 to biner at end of rope2. Have your belayer or additional ground support pull down on the belay side of rope 2. thus pulling the biner at the end (which your rope1/lead line is now clipped to) up approx 2m until the Figure8/Biner comes tight to the GriGri at bolt 6. Either tie off rope2 to a ground anchor or continue to hold on to belay side of rope2 (a few inches of slack may allow GroGri to Lock better in a fall). You are now on TR up to bolt 6. If you fall the grigri at bolt 6 will lock tight on rope2 creating a ""Biner-Rope2-GriGri-Biner-Bolt"" quickdraw so your rope-1 lead line experience will be indistinguishable from that of having a regular draw clipped at bolt 6. Once you clip bolt 7 (some will say 8 for safety) your rope-2 ""belayer"" can pretty much check out. also the rope 2 belayer can move laterally along the cliff base to keep rope-2 out of the climbers path.",Aug 2011,Jun 15 2020,0
3718,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,3,13, So John has clarified the discussion to a degree here.  Top rope access is not feasible. If it was~ then any discussion of pre-rigging some esoteric confukulation just to preserve some  semblance of “leading” is left to those who get off on such.  But if the discussion is more focused on how to safely climb past current limits such as 5.15+ overhangs and roofs where conventional clipping is Damn near impossible and conventional top roping is also impossible~ then I would say perhaps it’s time to think outside the box on “bolt hangers” like some carefully placed cold shut type open hooks that could be employed where the rope could be more easily and quickly be  “placed” or almost “auto-clipped” and the climbers direction of movement would tend to keep it in position (If open) until such time as a real clip stance can be reached.    Extra Rope drag would be a factor on “lead”~ but imagine a long Hard roof sequence “Secured” in such a way where the rope could be pre threaded with a long stick say.    Then you “top rope” through this sequence basically unthreading yourself as you climb without having to perform the difficulties of unclipping or clipping the standard way and having a reasonable level of safety from long pendulums or ground falls requires some planning and detailed forethought in placements and directions of pull.  Jim Titt probably has a solution available now. ,Jun 2013,Jun 15 2020,3

3734,Help me invent a retractable quickdraw?!,4,9, I only read the first page so forgive me if I'm repeating. If the route is too steep~ hanging a longer draw doesn't help. It actually puts the draw in a more awkward place to clip.  On a near horizontal route that I bolted with this problem~ I initially tried taping the sling against the wall. This worked but required a decent amount of time and A0 to even get into place. Since this was the Crux as well~ falling happened with some frequency.  When I bolted it~ I figured that since this was around the 10 or 11th clip of a 17 bolt route (120') that I'd be in the clear for a dyno then clip the bolt after sticking it. Due to the near horizontal nature of the route~ this actually pit me uncomfortably close to the ground when I missed (most of the time). I eventually put a new bolt in. Kindof a pita but was necessary to have any chance of sending.

OooOOoooh reboot's solution is slick! It does incur the risk of the downward force of the fall being redirected to an upwards force on the lower bolt hanger~ and~ since you've esentially installed a 1-to-1 pulley for this system (without a progress capture device) isn't the force on Bolt 6 subject to a 2X force multiplier (somebody please check my math here)?

There's no fixed gear to bail off of there. My friend climbed the 'damp' third pitch earlier that day~ and I've been on it in the rain~ i would say it's pretty protectable... It's a corner you stem on large holds and ledges~ not like it was a slipery slab or something. I arrived as they were starting to repel~ and asked if they wanted me to grab their gear and bring it down to them~ the one who seemed in charge said 'eh whatever'. Earlier I hear him ask his apprentice/partner 'if his life was worth $30?'~ which is about how much bail geay they left. A locker~ two fancy non-lockers with the wire-gate with a ball-shaped lock at the end~ an offset dmm nut~ and a newish-looking cordalette (around a tree). I grabbed it and brought it down about 30 minutes later~ but they were nowhere to be found. Still have it actually if they find me and want it back... I guess it wasn't the weirdest place to bail~ but like to not want your gear back~ they didn't seem in a rush either~ but maybe I'm missing something from their side of the story. tldr; Got 30+$ of gear from a strange pair bailing before the final pitch of a 3-pitch 5.3,Nov 2014,Jun 14 2020,1

3841,Oddest place you found booty,3,11, In the early 70s~ I was climbing Calypso in Eldorado Canyon for the first time. I was doing the right start~ which begins in a chimney like structure for 20 feet at the top of which is a handcrack leading to a little ledge. When I put my hand in the crack I was startled by some rustling material. Turned out to be small nylon utility sack. I tossed it to my belayer. When I got home and opened the sack~ I found it was full of marijuana.   A few weeks later~ I was climbing with a lawyer and said to him~ what if I had been stopped for a traffic violation on the way home and the cop discovered the bag in my car and I told him I had climbed 20 feet up a wall and found it when I put my hand in a crack. He said not even your lawyer would believe that story.   I decided some high school kid had probably hidden it there.,May 2002,Jun 16 2020,5

3847,Oddest place you found booty,3,17," Was climbing Regular NW Face of Half dome and at a horizontal crack I looked down behind the flake and there were at least a dozen #8-#9 sized hexes had fallen down @ 2 feet.

I was sadly unable to get a single one out as they were all @ 8""-12"" further down than my skinny arms would go. Before I could get back some Camp 4 denzien got up there with a coat hanger of some sort up and reportedly fished them out.  Next~ local climbing spot in Portland known for needles~ garbage and porn~ I was with some buddies picking up the trash after climbing.

3863,Oddest place you found booty,4,13, My only booty story was an easy chimney we were climbing at Devil's Lake.

I commented on it~ but didn't have my nut tool with me~ so I didn't touch it. I told eneryone else in our party~ thinking I'd grab my nut tool and go see if I could liberate it. Cut to 10 minutes later: my friend's son was climbing the route~ reached over~ and plucked it out with no resistance whatsoever. It was either competely forgotten~ or dropped from above and just happened to hang up in that spot. He offered it to me~ since I had seen it first.

3865,Oddest place you found booty,4,15, These aren't odd places per se~ but slightly odd:  A condom~ still in wrapper~ helpfully left by someone atop the P1 ledge of Invisible Airwaves at Looking Glass (I did not booty this). Another time I was sort of bored and belaying at the base of the amphitheater at Moore's Wall. I glanced down into the pine straw/litter at my feet and saw one pine needle that didn't look quite right. Picked it up and turned out to be the smallest of the BD micronuts laying on the ground. It was super rusty and even holding it in my hand it was hard to tell what it was. No idea how I found it~ it was so well camouflaged. Gave it to a friend who probably threw it out after we got back to the car.   My own stopper. I left a friend some gear and heard it was unrecoverable/stuck in the anchor so it got left behind. I had a hunch so before they could buy me a replacement I went back~ climbed the route and was able to retrieve my own gear.  As far as the actual thread title~ Chris~ does that copperhead you found in your helmet count? Probably not~ we threw it back. ,Jul 2009,Jun 17 2020,0
3866,Oddest place you found booty,4,16, Not really booty because it was mine but~ I was leading the Caverns in Yosemite~ I had a little speaker hanging off my gear sling connected to my phone (no one could hear this but my partner and me)~ the little tab broke off the speaker and it fell deep into the huge cavern. I didn't really care about the speaker~ but I didn't want to litter~ so I had my partner lower me down 20-30 feet into the cavern and I picked it up. It was actually really cool~ I wouldn't have taken the time to go down in there otherwise~ but once I was there it was really cool experience. Being in this deep crevasse like cave in the middle of a climbing route. I looked around but didn't see any other booty. I walked out the flat bottom of the cavern and came out onto the face maybe 40-50 feet below where I was lowered in~ and had a fun face climb back up to that point.,Oct 2011,Jun 17 2020,2

The anchor was a 3 piece gear anchor~ but we couldn't tell what gear it was from a distance. This descent is a gully that is ridden with webbing rap anchors~ so whoever made it must have gotten off route when climbing it or rappelling it.

3879,Oddest place you found booty,5,9, Got a full rack of runners and biners at the top of Commitment (Yosemite) that we turned into a  6 pack. We were under a couple~ they summited and took off~ left a full rack of alpine draws~ biners and regular draws. We had had some casual convos at the belay stations and knew they were in the SAR site so we headed down. They were both shocked and overjoyed when we showed up in their campsite with their stuff. Turns out that that was all of their runners~ and they had no more and no money to replace them. Insisted on supplying us with beer which we tryed to expain wasn't necessary.  Another time~ waling under the Prow~ some yoink dropped all of his pins (this was back when pins were a thing). At first I was pissed~ the stuff could have been seriously painful~ but then I started laughing at their embarrassment as we communicated~ walked it up closer to the base so they could rappel off and get their stuff. ,Mar 2006,Jun 18 2020,1

Curious~ I followed the rope up~ neglecting the business of route-finding~ and came to an anchor built of three medium cams.

3913,Good mask for running with glasses?,1,3, d1 distance runner here. The easiest solution will be to run somewhere where there aren't people. Short of fog-proofing your glasses~ every type of mask for the most part just tries to redirect air into a gentle~ contained cloud in all directions (especially up towards your eyes since the seal around your nose is terrible) rather than send it out in a powerful directed exhalation. Your glasses are always gonna get fogged. It is pretty easy to find places where there aren't people ever running~ unless you live in some crazy populated area.  and I know this isn't the answer you're looking for- but me and my ~ 40 teammates have been running twice a day~ outside in populated areas around lots of people~ for the last few months and not a single one of us have tested positive for covid or had a positive antibody test (which our local hospitals have been providing periodically). Just something to think about. ,Apr 2020,Jun 14 2020,11
3914,Good mask for running with glasses?,1,4, That (the unicorn like nature of the no-fog mask) was pretty much what I figured but was just hopin'. Not at all concerned with contracting covid-19 outside~ but I run mostly in a place (the Mohonk Preserve) where masks are required outside when 6' distance can't be maintained. And since I live fairly close to New York City~ people are pretty sensitive to the mask issue so I don't want to stress them out (or be stressed out by them having a freak out on me for not wearing a mask).

3915,Good mask for running with glasses?,1,5, I wear a buff around my neck and if I must run or pass someone at close distance I just pull it up until I pass them.    Unless you are in a really crowded area masks really aren’t needed outside~ it’s more just a common courtesy thing.,Apr 2012,Jun 15 2020,5
3916,Good mask for running with glasses?,1,6, Wash your glasses with liquid or bar hand soap in warm water prior to your run~ towel dry~ for me this reduces the fogging quite a bit~ and coupled with a focused directed exhalation straight out of my mouth takes care of about 99% of the fogging.When they do fog ~ they clear very quickly~ seems to be the benefit of the soapy wash.

3918,Good mask for running with glasses?,1,8, Soap can help with antifog~ but the majority of the problem comes from a poor fit around the nose. when the mask doesn't fit tight against your face~ most of your breath escapes from the gap~ directing it right across your lenses. (This is why a properly-fit N95 doesn't have nearly as much of a fog problem.) I've heard that folding up some tissue and placing it under the mask in the nose area can help. This supposedly seals the gap and prevents or reduces fogging. (It also makes the mask more effective.),Jul 2016,Jun 16 2020,2

3930,Good mask for running with glasses?,1,20, I don’t run~ unless I’m really scared or really mad~ but I wear and have worn masks and respirators at work (often vigorous labor) for years. Respirators are best for not fogging~ and disposable masks with a check valve vent work pretty well~ but those will only protect you~ not others~ as your “exhaust” is unfiltered. I have been using homemade (but not by me) cloth masks. I find that modifying them by removing whatever flimsy nose-wire is in there~ and replacing it with a longer~ stiffer~ piece of tie wire (used for tying rebar) then carefully shaping it to my funny-shaped nose~ eliminates the fogging problem. ,Aug 2018,Jun 17 2020,1

3936,Good mask for running with glasses?,2,5, OR nurse here~ I know a thing or two about masks.  First~ anti fog coat your lenses. Kroops and Cat crap seem to be the best. Make sure your glasses have a wire at the nose that conforms to your face. Bend it until it's perfect. Look for a mask with an adhesive against the skin. I don't know what exists in reusable but for disposable~ you've got a few options that have extra adhesive on the upper part of the mask. It helps a lot. Finally~ don't be afraid to tape that sucker in place. For running I bet kinesio tape would hold. I use the plain clear medical tape but it's not the only option.

3938,Good mask for running with glasses?,2,7, I wear a buff~ mostly. Easy up~ easy down~ and they are easy enough to breathe in while working hard even if leave them on all the time. They also keep the sun off your face~ ears~ or whatever the fuck neck meat situation you’ve got going. Otherwise~ I’ve worn a pollution mask with two valves for exhaling (it’s essentially an N95 as far as filtration) and I can actually run okay with the increased ventilation (did an 8-miler) with it but it’s expensive. You have to train up using a mask of any kind~ keep that in mind. As far as efficacy~ all masks are going to limit and start the downward trajectory of droplets and vapor~ hopefully limiting spread. I don’t know~ game it how you will~ I guess that’s really working out great for us. I wash my medical glasses and sun glasses in dish soap and that helps clean them up and keep them from fogging as bad. N95 respirators and the tight seal stop that fog completely~ as already pointed out (except you might get some perspiration fog). I tolerate them pretty well~ I wear them for hours straight at work~ but I’d save them for indoor~ crowded situations. Plus~ you’re gonna be gasping on a run.,Sep 2005,Jun 17 2020,0

People in other countries have been wearing masks for decades just as a simple courtesy to other people whenever they have a cold so the cold doesn't get spread around. It's not that hard.

3943,Knee/shin pads for climbing?,1,0, Hey there! I’m looking to get some insight on potentially getting some knee or shin pads for climbing. I am a new-ish climber with my current grade limit being 5.9. I’m going out every single weekend and climbing as much as I can now that the gyms have been closed and also doing push ups every day to try and gain some more strength. I know part of my issue is still being kind of a Gumby and not knowing how to climb right. However~ I also have extremely low iron (3ug/dL) despite taking iron supplements almost 7 days a week and bruise like a peach because of this and they take weeks to heal. Basically~ if I look at the rock the wrong way~ I bruise. I’ve already seen a hematologist about it and they pretty much told me they’re not going to do anything unless it’s severely impacting my ability to function. My arms do not bruise quite as badly as my legs which is why I’m considering padding for my legs over other areas. It’s summer and it’s hot and I want to be able to wear shorts and capris without people gawking at my severely black and blue legs. I also worry that constantly re-injuring the blood vessels in my legs could cause problems down the road. So please~ does anyone have any suggestions for knee or shin pads for climbing?,Feb 2020,Jun 17 2020,0

3945,Knee/shin pads for climbing?,1,2, Really no such thing.  For climbing anyway.   Knees are aid.   But you have options.  From full blown hockey style knee/shin pads in one (not recommended) to volleyball style~ to just something lower profile like a neoprene “brace” or support~ to just feigning injury and wrap with an ace bandage.    Either way your gonna get gawked at and likely have a lot of wtf questions Thrown at you.   But your legs’ll look good in capris away from the crag,Jun 2020,Jun 17 2020,2

3952,Knee/shin pads for climbing?,1,9," I'd say ditch the pads. This is a great opportunity to improve your technique since you actually have some additional consequences . If you're banging your knees and shins all the time it's due to sloppy technique (kneebars (unlikely on 5.9) and chimneys/off width excepted).

3953,Premature Biner Wear?,1,0, Hey there~ hoping to get some advice on some biner wear. I use the same Petzl AM'D for almost everything (rappel~ lead belay~ TR belay~ etc.) and I've only been using it for one season~ and a small amount last year~ but I am already starting to see some wear. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this problem? Some notes: I have ~100 pitches in this season~ and about 20 more last season on this guy when i bought it. I have cleaned my ropes twice so far this season so i don't think dirty ropes are the problem. Almost all of my climbing is in Vermont~ with a couple weekend trips to the ADK~ Gunks and NH. My partner hasn't been seeing this type of wear on their biner - makes me think that its something with how I'm using it~ or the hardware itself. I typically use an ATC for everything with a prusik backup when rappeling. Occasionally use a grigri if my partner is pushing their grade.The other side of the biner is showing a slight amount of wear as well~ but not nearly as bad as it is the smaller side. The previous locker I was using for everything didn't have any wear on it. I only switched because I wanted to use an autolocker for my rappeling/belaying/when cleaning routes.,Nov 2017,Jun 17 2020,0

3976,Premature Biner Wear?,2,2, It's almost entirely dependent on how sandy the area you climb in is. If granite sand is getting on the ropes~ that is a perfect abrasive for wearing out aluminum. For toproping~ switch out some aluminum biners on a draw with stainless steel and use a stainless locker for belaying if you can't get away from the sand. That's what I ended up doing.

3991,Premature Biner Wear?,2,17, I want to hear more about this issue of wear on the Edelrid insert biners. OP~ what is your source about the wear on these from canyoneering? Are there any photos online that show what you mean? I have one of them~ and it seems great. I always use it when I use a tube device~ which is almost never~ so I don't have any idea how fast they wear out. I'm guessing the aluminum on top wears down (mine has lost some anodizing here)~ and the steel insert wears~ but slower~ so the edge of the steel gets sharpened? Has anyone used one enough to get there yet? If you really want a full steel belay biner~ Edelrid also makes an I-beam style all steel locker~ which is rated to climbing specs~ not rescue specs~ and is therefore much lighter than any other steel locker. Get this one if you really insist on all steel. It looks and handles just like a regular aluminum locker.,May 2015,Jun 18 2020,1

I never said I would buy a steel biner because I may get into canyoneering~ but if I can spend slightly more and get a significantly longer life out of a frequently used piece of gear I absolutely will make that tradeoff. A full steel is less money for the same function and weight isnt an issue for me as most of my approaches are under 1/2 hour.  You missed what I said; I never said it was worn out~ I said it was showing what I thought was premature wear based on what I was able to find~ hence this post.

4017,ice protection on DT~ Owens Spalding route,1,0, My son and I did the Owens Spaulding route~ first week of June~  in 2000~ when son was twelve.  We are now planning to do route with  12 yr. old Grandson the last week of May 2020.  I've heard the route can be chocked up with snow and ice that time of year and that they are having record snow this winter.  My son and I have experience with crampons and ice axes~ my grandson does not.  To those who are familiar with how this particular route might be in the last week of May~ do you think it's feasible for grandson to follow using only micro spikes~ if he's roped and on bely over sections that have ice and snow?  I do think we could make sure he was not in a position where he might pendulum on a traverse. If this idea does not seem feasible perhaps we could take a few days at GT~ prior to starting the climb~ to work with him using real crampons and ax. Thoughts and suggestions are appreciated.,Jan 2020,Jan 27 2020,1

Take some time to teach your grandson the basic techniques of snow and ice climbing (with real gear) on some easy terrain~ but not as a crash course just prior to going up the Grand. Tailor the trip objectives to him and his current ability. Trying to shoehorn your grandson on the route in those conditions might be something you’d regret. Just not worth it.

4049,Doorway Hangboard Ideas,1,0," Currently I'm winding down the SICgrip business and just innovating and releasing new designs to DIYers and occasionally making custom versions. In recent times I've morphed more from the totally portable grips/bars approach~ to approaches based on using a doorway - both removable and ""permanent"". While I've been tinkering with some of these concepts off and on for years~ the last year or so I've been building prototypes as I've had the time.Here's some of the ideas - maybe it will spark your creativity if you can't get out on real rock or safely to a gym yet.Foldable minimalist board [LipStik] - that auto adjusts to doorway thickness - 5 hold depths~ pull-up jug and rounded 38mm flat holdAdjustable angle foldable grip hanger [The Gallows] - I later put a plywood ""skin"" on it for mounting holds or screwing a hangboard on. The following approaches do not interfere with opening/closing the door and there's enough clearance for those people under ~6' 2""Minimalist bar using a doorway pull-up bar [FlipStik] - the Bar hangs on a doorway pull-up bar and flips end--> end for a different depths of edgesRemovable/interchangeable minimalist board [ZipStik] - 4 screws using a French cleat idea. Can be flipped end --> end and has holds on front and back The following board [FatLip] can be mounted using the lip of the doorway and is held in place by three screws that go into and through the doorway trim into the doorway casing. It is supported by a rail that rests on top of door way trim and the screws provide pressure to hold board in place and provide pressure on the facing of the doorway itself. It has silicone sheeting to protect the doorway facing. It is mainly to provide a blank board that can be used to mount any holds. I put three T-nuts for holds or screw-ons can be used. I've chosen some versatile sloper/pinch/jugs from Tension Climbing and some cut down and highly modified Tension Climbing campus rungs. I've got a set of custom wooden holds in process that I'll eventually mount.",Dec 2012,Jun 18 2020,2

4061,Tensile testing old slings,1,11, I honestly expect to see that these are all at or very near rated strength.

The dogbones have many more falls~ the slings just a few~ but the slings saw much more time on rock~ occasional knotting~ used as a prussik once or twice... No significant uv exposue.   It's just at the age where I have doubts about it and I'd like the peace of mind of fresh webbing~ and I can afford it now~ so that helps too.

4070,Tensile testing old slings,1,20, Several years ago a friend of mine was able to test some slings that I retired.  They were roughly 5 years old and dyneema.  They had seen moderate use (once or twice a month) and caught some falls~ but they were stored indoors and didn't have any obvious damage.  I believe he only tested 2 or 3~ but they broke between 16kN and 17kN~ which is about 75% of full strength.  That's a small sample size~ but results are similar to what Gunkiemike and Jim Titt have found with much more testing (mine were on the high side).   I think you will find similar results.  Slings degrade with time and use~ and especially with exposure (as demonstrated by the Black Diamond data linked above).  And that's a good reason to periodically replace old soft goods. But it's also worth comparing the numbers to other parts of the climbing system.  A large (.75 and up) full-strength C4 is good for 14kN.  Medium sized stoppers are 10kN.  Small cams are rated at 8kN and less.  If you're OK falling on good gear~ you should be OK with 5 year old used slings even though you know they have lost significant strength. For me~ the main takeaways are... 1) Don't expect your slings to be full strength 2) Don't let that bother you 3) Despite #2~ replace your slings when they're really old and ratty and they start to bother you 4) Don't trust soft goods left outside with unknown history. Glad to see folks testing gear. I will be interested in the results.  ,Jul 2017,Mar 7 2018,6

4077,Tensile testing old slings,2,6, Interesting thread. It would be good to note before destruction if some of the sample (and which ones~ so we can try to correlate that with the results) have noticeable stiffness compared to new. I personnally tend to use that as a metric to know if I should or not retire old slings (along with visual inspection).

4083,Tensile testing old slings,2,12, then toss em if they have it? Isnt the glaze usually stiff as well? Whether you retire them if you find glazing is a choice you're going to have make for yourself. We know that glazing reduces the strength~ but how much depends on the severity and can only be determined by destructive testing. It could be 10% or 90% or anywhere in between and the uncertainty is unavoidable. Slings are pretty damn cheap in the grand scheme of things. Yes~ the glazed section is going to be more stiff because glazing is a surface level melting. You can expect the same kind of stiffness that you get when you melt the ends of a rope or cord~ although this stiffness may only exist on the surface~ as opposed to occur through the entire thickness of the webbing. Also keep in mind that glazing is slightly less concerning in cord because it is typically only superficial melting and may not reach the core. ,May 2014,Mar 9 2018,0

4087,Tensile testing old slings,2,16, Got some results! Don't have my full stats software access at the moment to make some pretty graphics / analysis~ but here's what we have so far: Data: Simple Summary:  The biggest takeaways so far are those minor nicks/pulls in the titan runners seemed to have a noticeable affect on overall strength - still plenty strong though. That at the barely used brand new looking dynema was significantly weaker than similarly aged nylon~ but again~ good enough to climb on. Overall~ I was surprised by how strong everything except the BD Dynex runners were.,May 2010,Mar 26 2018,17
4088,Tensile testing old slings,2,17, Very interesting! Thank you for sharing the results.,Nov 2014,Mar 26 2018,0
4089,Tensile testing old slings,2,18, This is so awesome! Very generous and super cool for your students. I got to pull test an old climbing rope in college and it was a great experience. The pull tester travel wasn't long enough (of course!) but we tested to failure with the head stationary by cutting the rope bit by bit and watching the force drop accordingly. The cool part was that the rope held something like 400 lbs on barely any remaining core.  For slings and dogbones it'd be really cool to see % loss vs time and % loss vs condition.  A visual metric could be set up for condition where you determine best to worst visual criteria and rate them 1 - 10.  An example (or multiple) of the worst sling or dogbone you want to consider can be valued 10~ moderate usage 5 and brand new would be 1 or 0. Pictures won't work well here~ physical examples displayed side by side with corresponding values may help students evaluate more effectively. In the short term this is unreliable data at best term but as sample size increases the data may display very understandable characteristics. ,Jul 2014,Mar 26 2018,0

4092,Tensile testing old slings,3,1, Awesome! Did you have any intuitive idea of which ones were going to be weakest? ,Jul 2009,Mar 27 2018,0
4093,Tensile testing old slings,3,2," Well~ on the 24"" runners~ only 3 had any noticeable defects~ and i thought they were mostly cosmetic~ those same 3 tested about 5 kN lower than the rest.  I was told by someone who's done some testing on these that when they're new~ these runners can get into the low 30kN range.  Bluewater rates them at 27~ but they don't have to.  Most companies just label everything as 22kn~ which is the UIAA standard~ even if they are stronger.  The slightly abused ones were at about 60-70% of what they are new~ while the better looking ones were about 80-90% what they would be new.    I also suspected this dogbone (#17) would be weaker~ as it had some fuzzing on it~ it tested just slightly lower than the rest of that set.  The picture doesn't do it justice~ it had some noticable abraison~ looked worse than the runners.  Seems to me that the nylon holds upbetter over time or was just significantly overrated to begin with.  I suspect based on the rough dimensions of the nylon dogbones that they would be in the high 20's new (comparing to available flat and tubular webbing).  Overall~ everything was still safe to climb with (easy to say in hindsight)~ but it's all been replaced now~ so i'm good for another 10 years or so~ barring any damage. I also want to note about the cut resistance of dynema - as part of my gear update~ i had all my cams~ tricams~ etc reslung.  It was significantly more difficult to cut off the dynema slings than the nylon~ even with a new razor.   They aren't lying about the cut resistance of that material.

4130,Tensile testing old slings,4,19, Good question~ as it may justify some (or maybe all) of the loss of strength compared to new. Generally speaking~ a lower diameter implies a smaller radius for the bend~ and a smaller radius in a bend is likely to concentrate forces along a smaller portion of the loop. There's a reason why most tests fails at the knot/hitch. It doesn't directly follow that in this case it would make a difference - depends what the curves that relates the radius with the highest force applied to the point of failure looks like. On the other hand~ it would be hard to imagine a mechanism through which the opposite would happen (e.g. where a smaller radius would decrease the highest force applied to the point of failure)~ unless someone can point out a plausible mechanism for that. Therefore we are probably fine concluding that it either had not significant impact or that it lead to an under-estimation of the strength left in those slings (relative to new with standard testing diameters).,Apr 2017,May 26 2019,0
4131,Tensile testing old slings,5,0, Food for thought. In many cases the 30 year old bolts on your sport or mixed rote are the biggest lurking danger. I will use my 25 year old petzl dog bones in barely used condition all while I suspiciously eyeball those old wedge bolts~ buttonheads~ stardryves etc. Climbing is inherently dangerous and old shitty bolts are killing people in actuality where the only example of nylon failure I can recall is Todd Skinners belay loop failure. Idk just be smart and don't assume any bolt  is bomb proof nor any single piece of gear in your safety system.

4145,Tensile testing old slings,5,14, OP here - when Dante tested my slings to failure~ he used a forklift pulling up against fixed point on a loading dock~ with some sort of gage/dynomometer connected to the sling between them.  You don't need a Tinius-Olsen tensile testing machine for this.,May 2010,May 4 2020,0
4146,Tensile testing old slings,5,15, Indeed.  Currently three 10k pound (44.5kN) mechanical dynamometers on EBay for ~$250.  “Crane scale” is another good search~ if you’re only interested in failure point.  And likely what Dante used,Jun 2019,May 4 2020,0
4147,Tensile testing old slings,5,16, Hm. Yep~ the stitch pattern is easily visible~ and they were sewn with a Speedy Stitcher with the heavyweight thread—I believe it's 40lbs tensile. They have more data on it. No liability issues because I've retired them all anyway.,Mar 2013,May 19 2020,0

4151,Tensile testing old slings,6,0, I see absolutely no liability problems.  Now back to breaking things. I don't know anything about nylon or other fabrics~ but I do know a little about metal & have done lots of testing on race engines. I have tested custom crankshafts & piston rods that come out of blown engines. Also a few new one. What I found interesting was how close a bent and cracked piston rod would test to its original strength. Also I've seen lots of engines tested to failure. You can run an engine right up to its breaking point & it will hold together for an amazingly long time~ but if you go over what it can take by just a little it will blow apart so fast that it is stunning.  I don't trust old webbing. ,Feb 2013,May 19 2020,0

4155,Tensile testing old slings,6,4, Let me throw this out there... I'm finishing up my PhD in engineering. I will (hopefully) be starting as a faculty next year and I am always looking for projects for classes that have real world applications. Would the community be interested in an ongoing 'service' of taking in old or failed gear and testing/destroying it if the results were cumulatively published in some easily accessible way? I think that would be a great ongoing project that would be a great way for students to get hands on experience writing up failure reports. Engineering wise~ I would like to see the following:,Nov 2019,Jun 17 2020,0
4156,Tensile testing old slings,6,5, Engineering wise~ I would like to see the following: for the last bullet point~ i suspect in many dynema slings~ the nylon is used as the weft~ holding the structure of the webbing together~ while the dynema is the warp~ providing the tensile strength.  You'll notice many are only colored at the edges.,May 2010,Jun 17 2020,0
4157,Tensile testing old slings,6,6, for the last bullet point~ i suspect in many dynema slings~ the nylon is used as the weft~ holding the structure of the webbing together~ while the dynema is the warp~ providing the tensile strength.  You'll notice many are only colored at the edges.,Nov 2019,Jun 17 2020,0
4158,Good use for old 'biners!,1,0, Got bored in the shop and decided to mill down and repurpose some old 'biners that were beyond their useful life. I couldn't stand to throw them out because they've got history!  Had some scrap aluminum sitting around and voila! - New key/coat racks! Made a couple of single hooks and a triple. Also experimented with open and shut gates.  Really strong!    Triple 'biner rack  Single 'biner rack  Triple 'biner rack,Mar 2006,Dec 9 2016,26

4162,Good use for old 'biners!,1,4, I guess I was sort of wondering if there might be a market for these.  Really looks good on the wall.  I figure that there are probably plenty of folks that have retired gear and would rather turn it into a rad looking piece of decor than throw it out.  I've been playing around with different brush finishes and mill/tooling patterns and think the mountains look pretty cool as a base plate.  Could do anything really~ single~ double~ triple carabiners~ whatever - but maybe not the MP logo as I'm not running a CNC~ just old school manual mill!  Could shoot me an email if you're interested.?.,Mar 2006,Dec 9 2016,3
4163,Good use for old 'biners!,1,5, How do you get the gates to stay open? They would be kind of annoying if you had to open the biner each time. Also snag-free biners are gonna work better.,May 2014,Dec 9 2016,1
4164,Good use for old 'biners!,1,6," Eli - I drill a 1/16"" hole when open near the pivot and drive a pin. Good ideas though- I could easily mill off the snag on the nose to keep stuff from catching.  I could see keeping the gates functional for a keyrack~ pinned for a coat rack. Fun to make!",Mar 2006,Dec 9 2016,1
4165,Good use for old 'biners!,1,7, ClimBaja - Exactly. Drill and tap being careful not to go all the way through. Panhead machine screws through the spine.,Mar 2006,Dec 9 2016,0

4168,Good use for old 'biners!,1,10, Looks ok~ but not sure this is an original idea.  I swear I've seen these in the physics room at my school.  Seems like that teacher was spending more time fiddling with toys than teaching~ but what are you gonna do about it?  Anyway~ I might buy a few off of you to hang gear on up at the Golf wall.  These do mount outside~ right?,Nov 2012,Dec 9 2016,1
4169,Good use for old 'biners!,1,11, Heck yes Kyle! Always fiddling with shiny trinkets! And yes~ would be totally solid bolted to the wall outside!! At least you'd know where your keys were!,Mar 2006,Dec 9 2016,1

4172,Good use for old 'biners!,1,14," If you supply the clips I think I could do them for $25/30 single~ $40 double (approx 7"" wide)~ and $55 triple (12"" wide) + shipping.  Aluminum isn't cheap these days and I am just about out of scrap. I would have to charge extra if I supplied the clips (waaay cooler if it's your nostalgic gear though).  Also  have to know if you'd like the gates pinned or not.  The double and triple would have the mountain background and singles would be triangular plates or the mtn plate. Designs would vary and each one would be unique as I am operating an old school manual mill and free-handing the individual finish.",Mar 2006,Dec 10 2016,1

4177,Good use for old 'biners!,1,19, Marc - yes~ some of these clips are burnt out pretty bad (deep notches from perma-draws on local routes) but some are from the first batch of gear I ever picked up and aren't toasted that bad.  I've have long since upgraded to better hardware but can't stand to part with 1st gen (for me) stuff.  The biners don't have to be shralped~ most will work - even lockers and wire gates.,Mar 2006,Dec 11 2016,0

4199,Good use for old 'biners!,3,0, OK~ please don't blame Dave for how fucked up this looks:-) I had some old biners~ 3 old Chouinards and 3 old Bonati Ds. In an attempt to clean them up (I paint my yellow/blue colors on everything with enamel) I dumped them into some crazy dangerous shit we use for Stainless steel. Never have used it on any Aluminum and I learned a lesson. Turned them near black. Deep black would have been fine~ but they were not deep black. Plus for that to have worked I should have degreased them first~ but I didn't so I didn't get a consistent look. And the paint I'd put on was still there but the paint on one Bonati was peeling off. Shit!    Anyway~ Dave took a shot at cleaning up my mess and did a better than fair effort too. So~ the reason this looks as good as it does is cause Dave did a great job. I sent in 6 old biners that I'd screwed up royally and got this back. I'm very happy! Thanks Dave!! David Heerschap artwork. Coat rack made with old Carabiners.    Big kudos to Dave for pulling my disaster out of the fire and making some art! You'd never know how bad I'd screwed it up if I hadn't told ya:-) You can click on the photo twice to see it fullsized. It's a little bitter sweet~ I recall buying them new. They got old~ I got old. At least there may be some little value still left in us both. LOL,Mar 2006,Jan 24 2017,0
4200,Good use for old 'biners!,3,1, Thanks for the kind words Bill - it was fun figuring out how to clean up the mess to make your hardware look good again! I really like the way older carabiners look on the racks - especially when they have personalized stamps~ tape~ or markings that show that they've been used for years on someone's rack. Working on a few new designs that folks might like - Mosquito Range from Breck~ Maroon Bells~ Boulder skyline~ etc. Post some pics soon!,Mar 2006,Jan 29 2017,0
4201,Good use for old 'biners!,3,2, Nice! Always good to see people applying their creativity.   David~ have you tried playing with copper yet? It's fun to work with~ also~ and might be nice with certain colors~ or for folks who prefer some warm accents.   Make sure you charge enough if you are selling to the general public. Hand made is special~ and should be appreciated as such.   Best~ Helen,Aug 2015,Jan 29 2017,0
4202,Good use for old 'biners!,3,3, An ElCap rack could easily entice me and Half Dome as well. Even better~ the view with both profiles.,Jan 2007,Jan 29 2017,0
4203,Good use for old 'biners!,3,4, Helen - haven't experimented with copper yet~ but might try - good idea as I have a smaller mill and can't use materials much harder than aluminum.  Think I'm priced pretty fairly - check out my etsy shop at davesclimbdesigns.etsy.com   Jeff - I've been tooling around and the Valley is pretty hard to do as it takes lots of raised detail work (I'm all manual - no cnc.) No excuses - I think it would rock so I'll keep trying!,Mar 2006,Jan 30 2017,0

4206,Good use for old 'biners!,3,7, Locker - yes~ good idea. I usually mill off the sharp part so jackets don't snag.  Keylock biners are preferable for sure. Also much easier to pin the gates open.  Wire gates are a bitch but look pretty good once they are done.,Mar 2006,Feb 4 2017,1

4209,Good use for old 'biners!,3,10," Nice! I enjoyed futzing around with metal~ now and then~ over the years~ almost all of it by hand. In recent times~ I've played with wire~ recycling it. Hard part there is stripping the stuff~ and finding the needle nosed pliers again~ which tend to get ""borrowed"".   Keep up the nice work!   Best~ Helen",Aug 2015,Feb 25 2017,0
4210,Good use for old 'biners!,3,11, The black 'biners' look nice. How did you make them black? Is it paint~ or a dip coating?   Also~ it seems like the tapping process to mount the biners would take a bit of time~ so did you consider using epoxy instead?    Anyway~ thanks for posting. The pics look great.

4212,Good use for old 'biners!,3,13, Thanks for the kind words! Psyched to have the shop open. Yes - those are stock new positrons that come painted black - epoxy coat or something.  While I HATE to mill down new carabiners to make racks~ some folks wanted this as an option. Using and showing off old gear is DEFINITELY the point and I hope to make most of the racks in this style! Just got a box load of really great old lockers and mixed biners that have been used and abused up in the Winds and can't wait to mount them up!   SinRopa - got your message~ replied back - can certainly do your custom rack and really like to make new silhouettes.   I have not thought about epoxying the carabiners to the plates but I guess I could somewhere down the line. Bolting them just makes them so darn strong and I don't mind the manual work.  Kind of therapy~ really!    -Dave,Mar 2006,Feb 26 2017,0
4213,Good use for old 'biners!,3,14, Hey~ I looked at this thread and got inspired. I am in the process of making one out of wood. I tend to be on call some weekends~ so I create projects around the house.    I'm not finished with mine yet~ so no completed pics. I think I'll do a dark stain on the wood.

4215,Good use for old 'biners!,3,16," I bought some J fasteners at Lowes. They look like the linked pic.    I'm going to recess the back~ then cut and grind the excess metal in the back off. I don't expect it to work great because of the soft pine. This is just one of the $6 pieces of ""craft project"" wood that Home Depot sells.    I have a tremendous amount of hardwood scraps~ so if I like how this turns out~ I'll glue a bunch together and do it over. If I go that route~ it'll look a lot like a fancy cutting board with biners on it.   The question is whether to leave the biners old and tarnished or to give them the industrial look with the wire wheel.   OP~ sorry for the hijack~ you make beautiful stuff. I'm just dicking around in the backyard. ",Oct 2012,Feb 26 2017,0

4231,Good use for old 'biners!,4,12, Just put together a new rack for a few friends that live under the shadow of Mt. Shasta out in California and I'm pretty psyched with how it turned out!  I've built quite a few racks over the past year and have gotten a bunch of requests for 2 - 4' wide designs but didn't think it was possible on my little mill until now!  Spaces 4 'biners out really well!   If you've got a design idea let me know~ I just may be able to make it.  Christmas is right around the corner and these make really cool gifts!  A great way to immortalize your old carabiners!  Feel free to message me directly or go check out my designs atdavesclimbdesigns.etsy.com  Climb on! ,Mar 2006,Nov 13 2017,4

4235,Good use for old 'biners!,4,16, mnjsan - thanks for the kind words!  Much appreciated~ and I enjoyed putting your rack together and miss some of the spectacular views in the NE!  (I learned to climb in the Gunx) MisterE Wolfe - My friends and I have kind of joked about putting a rack at the top of a climb up in Sinks Canyon as an anchor.  I think they're STRONG but no way I'd lower off!!  10-32 machine screws.........um no.  ,Mar 2006,Dec 18 2017,1

4237,Good use for old 'biners!,4,18, A year or so ago I hijacked your thread talking about making something similar but with wood. My wife provided some feedback~ she didn't like the old biners but really liked the mountains idea.  I ended up going with 3 layers of differently stained wood and those fighting octopus style hangers in brass. It's not as overtly climberish but it turned out great.   ,Oct 2012,Dec 18 2017,3
4238,Good use for old 'biners!,4,19, Highalt - your rack looks great~ well done! Those hooks give lots of room for jackets!

4242,Good use for old 'biners!,5,3," Just a quick update on the whole carabiner rack project - lots of folks have inquired about turning their personal dream views into metal and for the most part I've been able to figure it out!  Only issue is carabiners aren't wearing out quick enough around town supply them for racks!  We just had a rebolting day up at Sinks~ took care of a dozen routes (installed new wave glue-ins)~ and were able to snag a few more old anchor biners for racks. A good issue to have I guess!  A few folks originally asked about wider racks so I figured out a way and now make a stock 20"" wide 4 carabiner rack (on my etsy).  Also wanted to show off a view of Lover's Leap that I put together for a customer - starting to use secondary back plates to bring out subtle details.  Pretty proud of this one!  -Dave  ",Mar 2006,Mar 28 2018,4

4250,Good use for old 'biners!,5,11, I took some old Chouinard and Boniti biners collecting dust in the basement and sent them off to Dave. I'd tryed to make them black with some homebrew crap that only succeeded in making them look like dark grey crap with black splotches. I sent them in anyway~ and Dave fixed \my mistake~ made a masterpiece and Dave~ I still love it. One had 6~ 2 had 3 biners. Thanks for the great work! Still holding up and looking awesome 4 years later. Worth every damned penny. I have no idea what you charged and I've forgotten that part. But the art you created still looks great!

4251,Good use for old 'biners!,5,12, Thanks for the kind words Bill - was a pleasure putting your rack together for you and I'm glad it's still hanging strong! FWIW I do a bunch of biz directly (send me a PM) but if you'd like to see what I'm putting together my Etsy shop is a good place to start.  I'd say the ratio these days is about 50/50 - custom mountains to stock racks.   Also - they are pretty sweet for van gear organization if you don't mind putting a few holes in your rig - we've got three of them in ours.  Take care for now MP'ers!  -Dave  Looong brushed jagged mtn custom rack,Mar 2006,Jun 11 2020,2

4255,Ice climbing boots,1,0, So I got into ice climbing last year and I used my partners gear so now I need to get my own.  Can anyone recommend me a warm pair of boots? That’s really my #1 priority.  If my feet are not warm then I won’t leave the house.  There is nobody around that carries them so I can’t go look at them first. ,Sep 2018,Jun 15 2020,0
4256,Ice climbing boots,1,1, The most important thing when buying ice boots is how they fit your feet and hold your heel. Since you're in Pocatello~ I would drive to SLC and try boots on in person~ or go to the Bozeman Ice Fest in December and demo pairs there. Maybe give gear stores in Driggs/Jackson a call and see what they have in stock. There are a lot of things I will buy online~ boots are not one of them.,Aug 2014,Jun 15 2020,5
4257,Ice climbing boots,1,2, Not really looking to buy online~ I’ll take a drive when I go to buy them. Just looking for suggestions on warmth. I’m a fair weather climber that is trying to enjoy the winter rather than just endure it. Kinda retarded I know but the summers in Idaho make the winters worth the wait. ,Sep 2018,Jun 15 2020,0
4258,Ice climbing boots,1,3, Narrow foot - LaSportiva Wider foot - Scarpa I guess I would start w/ the LS G5 or Scarpa Phantom and go from there.  Be prepared to drop some coin.  Warmer usually = $$$$.,Dec 2008,Jun 15 2020,4
4259,Ice climbing boots,1,4, Tucker~ like any climbing gear~ once you get into it~ you’ll likely own several pairs.  As a base pair of “do it all“ general purpose first boots~ you can’t go wrong really (if fit is right) if you look at the la Sportiva Nepal versions if La Sportiva Tends to fit your feet.  Either way~ Scarpa~ Lowa (I love Lowa) Salomon~ Salewa~ Mammut~ etc etc have great stuff. Get boots in the mid-range....not too light (spring/Summer weight) not too heavy (high altitude style) and compatible with both front and back bails~ if it’s primarily for pure ice climbing in the winter.  (do you have crampons?) Bottom line: Get the lightest boots your cold tolerance will allow~ that fit comfortably~ and that are fully crampon compatible.    Beyond that~ not sure what anyone can really say.  What’s warm enough is pretty subjective and only you can tell the fit. ,Jun 2013,Jun 15 2020,0
4260,Ice climbing boots,1,5, ,Sep 2018,Jun 15 2020,0
4261,Ice climbing boots,1,6, Generally double boots will be warmer than single. Sportiva Baruntse~ Spantik~ G2~ and Scarpa Inverno and Phantom come to mind. The trade-offs will be weight~ walking comfort~ and cost. But if you know warmth is your #1 priority~ that’s where you’ll find it.,Dec 2008,Jun 15 2020,1
4262,Ice climbing boots,1,7, Totally agree with all this. I ve been a Scarpa phantom person for years (ice climbing and winter mountaineering) but I know some people find them too wide and go for la sportiva instead.  the 2 models you mentioned are indeed the benchmark of ice climbing boots. ,Dec 2019,Jun 15 2020,1
4263,Ice climbing boots,1,8, As with many others~ there may be some trial and error involved in this. Attending an Ice Festival and trying out different boots might be a good option before committing to a purchase. If you're on a shorter timeline than that and cannot get to a shop to try stuff on~ I recommend the La Sportiva Nepals. I've had my pair for over 10 years now with use in New England ice climbing and a couple trips to the Cascades. Rarely are my feet cold. ,Nov 2012,Jun 17 2020,1
4264,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,0, Looking for a wide climbing shoe for Roman shaped feet. I have EEEE feet~ so most climbing shoes don't tend to fit. I started off with BD Momentums which largely fit~ but have tried some other moderately aggressive shoes and have not found any that worked well.  I've seen stuff on the forums and elsewhere on wider climbing shoes~ largely from Scarpa and Five Ten. Do these shoes tend to work for Roman feet as well? Any recommendations? Thanks!,May 2020,Jun 15 2020,0
4265,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,1, One of my friends has super wide feet and he wore Boreal Jokers for a while which fit him great but now he wears the Scapra Maestro's which he also likes.   I also have wide and quite high-volume feet and Evolv's are perfect for me.  Any of their shoes that don't have a slipper design that limits the volume (X1 and Agro) fit me perfect. Haven't ever tried any Scarpas and I've only tried a few Five Ten shoes~ but the ones I did try (newer Quantums) were still too narrow for my feet despite those models being some of the wider shoes in their range.,Jul 2016,Jun 15 2020,1
4266,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,2, Both 5.10 Moccasyms and Scarpa Origins work pretty well for wide feet.,Jan 2001,Jun 15 2020,0
4267,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,3, I have Roman feet with 2E width and scarpas fit me the best by far. The instinct laces fit me a little better than Vapor Vs do. ,May 2019,Jun 15 2020,2
4268,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,4, have EEE foot. scarpa maestros have worked best for me,Sep 2013,Jun 15 2020,1
4269,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,5, Jeff~ thanks for the advice. Do you find the instincts break in or stretch much over time? Also~ do you know if the instinct laces fit different than the VS and VSR? ,May 2020,Jun 15 2020,0
4270,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,6, Jeff~ thanks for the advice. Do you find the instincts break in or stretch much over time? Also~ do you know if the instinct laces fit different than the VS and VSR? Nah they're synthetic so the stretch is minimal. I know they fit a little differently than the VS/VSR~ but the same size in the lace and VS both feel very good for my foot. ,May 2019,Jun 15 2020,1
4271,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,7, I have wide feet with a shallow heel so sizing up makes the heel super baggy for me. I started in velcros since I mostly boulder (like the scarpa boostic) but then switched to the mago which were way more comfortable (though very different purposes as the boostic is stiff as hell). I think switched to the redesigned LS testarossa (red) and those fit like a dream in comparison. Heel fits amazing. Forefoot could be a touch wider for me taste. But laces are key,Jun 2015,Jun 15 2020,0
4272,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,8, What type of climbing are you planning on doing? For bouldering~ I also reach for my Instinct VS/VSR for my wide Roman foot. Remember not to size them too snug as they don't stretch at all~ not even 1/2 size.,Jul 2018,Jun 16 2020,0
4273,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,9, Jeff~ thanks for the advice. Do you find the instincts break in or stretch much over time? Also~ do you know if the instinct laces fit different than the VS and VSR? I have owned both the lace and velcro models and they fit the same~ the VSR's fit the same as well but because they are a little softer I can go down half a size. I think the velcro VS is a little stiffer than the lace but that may just be my opinion. They will stretch a little under half a size so if you have a place to try them on always try on a half size bigger and that's what they will feel like after they break in.,Feb 2017,Jun 16 2020,0
4274,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,10, I have extremely wide feet. Testarossas for sport/bouldering and Katana Laces for longer routes. ,Feb 2018,Jun 16 2020,0
4275,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,11, I have a 9.5 EE. Medium arch~ thick foot~ short stubby toes~ and the Katana Lace are the best fitting shoe I've tried. I would never have thought it would fit as well as it does~ just from looking at it.,Jul 2015,Jun 16 2020,0
4276,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,12, Just checked out Roman Foot. Looks much like mine.,Jul 2015,Jun 16 2020,0
4277,Wide shoe for Roman foot,1,13, What type of climbing are you planning on doing? For bouldering~ I also reach for my Instinct VS/VSR for my wide Roman foot. Remember not to size them too snug as they don't stretch at all~ not even 1/2 size. I'm mostly planning on using them for bouldering~ both indoor and outdoor~ but I hope to start lead climbing soon as well.,May 2020,Jun 16 2020,0
4278,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,0, I am searching for any published results recording the holding strength of stakes driven into the earth as rappel anchors~ preferably substantial metal anchors. Why on earth would I want such data? I am a retired NPS archaeologist~ last assigned to Channel islands National park.  There are extensive sea cliffs and canyon walls carved from unconsolidated Pleistocene sediments which contain fossil remains~ typically pygmy mammoth~ that re best recovered by rappelling from the flat~ grassy surface above .  I have done this numeroustimes~ using three stakes in a triangular configuration i use mil surplus stakes~ allegedly used to jold down Marston matting in helipads~ about a meter long with a U shaped cross section about 5 cm x 7 cm.  These are typically driven about 45-50 cm deep into good compact soil at a slight incline.  I have set up this anchor configuration numerous times (50 =/-) and I have never observed any sign of incipient failure. I would like to learn of any controlled tests that might have been performedon arig of this type.  i have read informally of such tests being run at Golden Gate Recreation Area (San Francisco)~ but inquiries there have come up empty. BTW~ I would never do this for any purpose other than to collect material otherwise unobtainable.  The sea cliffs are choss piles squared and a helmet is absolutely mandatory~ even after clearing off the larger pieces.  Over time~ we have acquired some very significant specimens on rappel which would otherwise rapidly disintegrate. Comments~ leads~ references~ and comments are appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance,Nov 2009,Feb 26 2020,13

4282,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,4," For multiple stake systems you should check military manuals~ they build them for heavy vehicle recovery anchors.

4286,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,8, My crew used a similar anchor setup for rappelling while working in Mesa Verde National Park over a decade ago. I have to admit that it scared the crap out of my fellow climber friends~ but the anchors always seemed super bomber.

4290,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,12," Tandem pickets are used in rope rescue usually 3 in a line ""1-1-1"" each tied back. Originally~ circus tent stakes were used~ but now there are now purpose built stakes and plates that replace the tieback webbing. Sort of like anchoring to trees and shrubbery~ you'll never have a engineer out there telling you how much a particular system is rated but typically they are good for several thousand pounds. I haven't found good published data and I'm not sure if it exists since the strength depends on the soil. In this test in rocky desert soil they pulled 6000 lbs and the pickets didn't budge. They also did a test on the plate version with similar results. I also prefer this rigging method to pretension all of the pickets and the interleaved webbing makes it redundant against failure of the first picket.",Jun 2019,Feb 28 2020,4
4291,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,13, Really good resourse Tammy.  youtube.com/watch?v=-RrtcBN…  (video as linked above in previous post) The 1-1-1 is very common sense.  If you are in a system where a picket is showing failure~ you immediately back it up in that way out of desperation.  I figured this one out while anchoring the ends of a monkey bridge (rope bridge) for Boy Scouts.    It's valuable to know this because if you didn't~ and you were used to normal belay station climbing anchors were you equalize 3 anchors spread out~ the system would not hold the load that the 1-1-1 system  could hold.,May 2007,Feb 29 2020,1
4292,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,14, Don~ are you still in the Ventura area? In Ojai there is foothill crag.

4295,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,17, To respond to Jeff Luton's post:  I haven't been to Foothill crag recently~ but those would be placed in (relatively) solid rock~ kind of mega pitons.  i am talking about stakes in soil~ and then loaded laterally.  The references given earlier seem to indicate rather decent holding power around 1000 pounds per stake~ no matter how aligned.  This is indeed helpful and reasonably reassuring.,Nov 2009,Feb 29 2020,1
4296,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,18,  There are purpose built these reverse pole pounders that I've never seen in the wild~ or this lever based grabber that I believe is just a standard circus tent stake puller.

4297,Driven Stakes as Rappel Anchors,1,19," I've done a good bit of research on this topic. I'll try to give you an unbiased opinion but full disclosure I designed an anchor plate and picket anchor system you've already seen on this thread. The most robust data comes from the Industrial Fabrics Association International and the University of Illinois ""Pullout Capacity of Tent Stakes"" They made a pretty good pocket guide here http://tent.ifai.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2016/06/trd_2014_stakingpocketguide.pdf The vast majority of the time your holding power is much more dependent on your soil than the apparatus you use but you can certainly maximize the capacity but paying attention to stake configuration~ diameter~ spacing~ insertion angle and insertion depth.  Personally~ I've pulled picket systems to failure hundreds if not thousands of times and I use the term ""failure"" as any time there is more than 2"" movement in a system from where it started. I'm sure a slow rappel won't give you problems in just about any ground and in several different picket set-ups but I would be concerned about a shock load from a fall.

4300,Favorite Guidebook?,1,0, Hi everyone - we're in the process of creating a new guidebook for a local area and we want ideas! What is everyone's favorite guidebook and why?    Thanks!,Mar 2012,Sep 21 2014,0
4301,Favorite Guidebook?,1,1, My favourite guide book is Adirondack Rock by Lawyer and Haas.   Why:    Clear diagrams.  Both photos & diagrams of major cliffs to help in finding routes.     By-pitch break down of difficulty including entries like 5.10a (5.8 R~ 5.5 X) rather than just 5.10a X -- so you have a better idea of what the risk level is for a climb.  I wouldn't go near a 5.10a X climb (since 10a is about my lead limit)~ but the climb described tells me the 10a climbing is well protected~ and the X sections are far easier.  That climb I would contemplate doing.   GPS co-ordinates for both cliffs and the start of approaches.   Online updates and corrections.   Good writing about bits of history of the area.,Aug 2010,Sep 21 2014,0
4302,Favorite Guidebook?,1,2, Haycock Mountain Bouldering is the best book for bouldering Iv ever seen.  Great pictures of problems that are like mini topos~ gps coordinates for locations (which is great since lots of the smaller trails there grow over each year)~ and walking directions that make sense.  Saw that you are from Jersey also~ and if you ever went to climb at Haycock Im sure you have gotten lost too unless you have this book!  This book is as good as you can get for a bouldering area that isn't swamped with people like Lincoln Woods or P-way further north.  I think you can only get it at the Doylestown rock gym or you can order through them.     In terms of books for route climbs~ Secrets of the Notch for the climbs up at Cannon is really great.  Useful pitch by pitch descriptions~ directions that make sense for finding the start of routes~ and its small enough to throw in the seconds pack for a day.  I also like the 'one star or none' which the author says is to prevent people from doing only 5 start routes or what not~ since there are so many good climbs to do out there.     Also~ would love to know where you are looking to make a book for (unless its top secret!),Jan 2012,Sep 21 2014,0
4303,Favorite Guidebook?,1,3, We travel the USA and spend 3 days to a month at any given area.  As a result we rely heavily on guide books and MP to help us get climbing without spending 1-2 days scouting.  So rather than say which of the 20 guide books we have is the best I will list the things that I like in guide books.    1. Clear directions to the climbing area~ GPS coordinates help a lot. Accurate trail descriptions.   2. Over all drawing or sat shot of the climbing area~ each section labeled.   3. Picture of climbing routes~ large overall shot~ then closer shot if appropriate. Love the old style diagrams~ they show a lot of dedication to the climbing area.  But pictures are easier to correlate against the rock to make sure you have found the route you want.     Please take the pictures from the trails. You often get a much clearer shot by climbing across the creek and halfway up the other side of the hill~ great for over view of the routes~ but try correlating that shot while walking into the area.    4. On the route description bolt and anchor placements diagramed.   5. If it's trad routes clear description of rap station~ if available.   6. Length of climb~ do you need a 50m~ 60m~ 70m~ or 80m rope?   7. Source of closure notifications.  It's disheartening to travel a couple of days to a climbing area only to have little signs up that the area is closed.  Typically it's raptor nesting.  Don't mind the closures~ just would like to know before I go. Since closures change all the time you can't put that in a book~ ergo the source would be nice.    8. Reference section for local climbing organization.  Some are stronger than others~ some have a lot of information~ some have a meeting once a year~ maybe. But as a guest to other peoples climbing areas I would like to know whom to contact to provide route damage information and/or supply anchors/bolts for routes that need repair~ then leave it up to the locals to use the donated parts for that route or others.     9. History of climbing in the area.  Key players~ etc.  Always a good read.    10. List of local stores that sell guide books and equipment.  Even paid advertising pages are good.     11.  Cross reference by grade in the Index.  Include Trad~ TR Sport and number of pitches.    There tends to be an assumption made by guide book writers that the person reading the book already has some knowledge of the area.  For a traveling climber this is a little frustrating.  References to places that are assumed common knowledge by people that live in the area are of little use.     In the last two years we have climbed in areas from Arcadia NP in Maine to Smith Rock in Oregon.  We meet and talk with folks that are climbing.  I would estimate that a good 1/3 of the people we meet are traveling climbers as well.     Good for you taking on this project.  It's a lot of work~ but it is deeply appreciated by those of us that use the books.,May 2013,Sep 21 2014,1

4376,BD Crack gloves!,2,18, I just got the pair. I measured to be right in the middle of medium~ they feel a little tight but I know they will stretch. The finger loops feel more solid than the OR gloves~ similar in thickness. They aren’t just stamped to cut out. They fold over and are sewn and glued. The Velcro strap feels thicker with a rubberized backing. Without climbing in them I’m impressed so far.,Feb 2009,Mar 12 2020,23
4377,BD Crack gloves!,2,19, I received mine yesterday as well~ and I will echo dindolino's sentiments regarding design and build quality. They seem well-conceived and well-made. They are more similar to the OR gloves in terms of thickness and material than the Ocun~ but the coverage of the hand~ particularly the base of the hand/palm on the pinky side is more reminiscent of the Ocun. I wear a medium in the Ocun glove~ a small in the OR~ and for the BD I went with a small. I based this off of the measuring guidelines they gave. They fit pretty snugly~ but I prefer a tighter fit with these things~ and I figure the material will give some over time~ especially the finger loops. Will update after I get to take them out.

4388,BD Crack gloves!,3,10, Climbing gloves? You'll never get those sexy leathery back's of your hands that say you've been through years of climbing. Tape is a compromise~ sometimes you gotta do it~ but taping well is a fine art and thus elevates itself above the simple plug and play glove. I would think that a company with  such a rich background in climbing would be embarrassed to make such a thing. Obviously they have no shame. I can't believe that y'all climbers want to finish the day with the smooth~ thin skinned hands of a surfer. Please. Your gobies and callouses are badges of honor. wear them accordingly. Over the years your hands will become like the leather of a fine shoe.  Then of course there's this little elephant in the corner called knowing how to climb. If you need those gloves you don't. You'll never know how to set a funky jam properly. And then there's that transition from hands to thin fingers where the gloves get into your space in the wrong way. Yeah I know~ some glove advocate is already posting up; well then good shoes are cheating too. Fine. I've seen great climbers do incredible things in good shoes. I've yet to see a great climber using gloves. Caveat. I've used leather finger-less leather gloves aid climbing on El Cap. I thought it would be nice to still have knuckles at the top.,Apr 2004,Mar 17 2020,16

4407,BD Crack gloves!,4,9, Used mine for the first time today and my thoughts are: I really like how they fit and how thin they are~ they never interfered with setting or releasing jams.  They aren't white anymore.

4409,BD Crack gloves!,4,11, Some more feedback about the BD gloves... I got to try them out a couple of weeks ago and for me they were awesome. Based on the limited amount of climbing I did in them (4 pitches. Actually~ the same pitch 4 times) they are my personal favorite of the crack gloves I have used (Ocun~ OR). Here are some observations: -I like that they are thin and low profile(I did not have any problems on thin hand james) but offer great coverage. -I  was concerned about the velcro coming undone as well but I did not experience that issue at all~ though the route I climbed was not a sustained~ repetitive crack climb~ but more varied. Still~ the velcro stayed put and the tab did not come into contact with the rock at all on normal hand jams. -They are harder to get on and off than other models due to the thumb coverage. Not a big deal if you are leaving them on all climb~ but if I were planning on taking my gloves on and off throughout a long climb~ I might go with the Ocun instead for this reason. -No knuckle padding. I only care about this on sustained cupped hands (which I avoid anyway because I love myself) but they do not offer any meaningful padding for the hand (virtually identical to the OR in this department). -Nothing to say about durability at this point. If I remember and anyone is still interested I will try and provide more updates after further and more varied use.  Happy climbing! Xan,Mar 2010,Mar 23 2020,13

4414,BD Crack gloves!,4,16, Gave them a whirl and found them much better than Ocun and slightly better than OR. The thumb protection is such a needed feature. I do a full comparison write of up Ocun~ OR and BD on my blog:bricepollock.com/ultimate-c…,Jun 2016,Mar 29 2020,6
4415,BD Crack gloves!,4,17, I just got mine. Medium was the ticket for me being directly between the measurements for small and medium. I’m not a fan of the thumb coverage ... despite climbing wide hands and fists a good deal~ I never get thumb gobies.  The thumb hood restricts my ability to bend my thumb~ so I might take a pair of scissors to it.

4452,BD Crack gloves!,6,14, Re: durability ... I've put about 8500 outdoor vertical feet on mine. The pinky loops just ripped and the thumbs are getting close. My biggest complaint~ though~ is that my hands seem to get far hotter than tape or even the Splitter gloves. Perhaps the extra thumb coverage is the culprit? I haven't used chalk in seven years~ but yesterday I was really wishing for it on a 1500' granite route. With that said~ I still think they're superior to the OR's (too flimsy) and Ocun's (too thick). ,Mar 2012,May 18 2020,0
4453,BD Crack gloves!,6,15, The sensitivity of these gloves is right where it needs to be — enough to protect your hands but not too much to take away from feeling the rock. My complaint would be in the thumb loop. Its too large so the edge bites into my palm. Also the stiffness and length restricts my thumb from bending. Seems like it was built for people with extremely long thumbs. Overall its good. I’ll give it two thumbs up~ because I can’t bend them. ,Apr 2011,May 19 2020,14

4457,BD Crack gloves!,6,19, Got a chance to try mine finally- on a boulder problem~ not a long sustained crack~ though.  My assessment is similar to others here.  The fit is terrific.  Unfortunately I can tell already where the failure in them is going to occur after just one use.  So~ in the meantime~ I tape my wrist- kind of in the same way I would for a sustained tight fist/cupped hands crack on top of the glove.  I also don’t cinch the Velcro quite as tight as I would if I didn’t have anything reinforcing it. ​If it sounds a little silly to use tape and gloves (and extra aid-y) that’s because it is.  But~ it is less tape than making gloves and like I said~ the rest of it seems well-designed~ so I want to try to make them last. Hopefully KP from BD has someone eyeing this thread for feedback~ and improvements on durability and the wrist configuration will come out in a 2.0 version.,Jul 2011,Jun 3 2020,1
4458,BD Crack gloves!,7,0, Update- I have used these for 2 months. They are delaminating in multiple spots.... but I will run my sewing machine over those and extend the life.

I have climbed at least 3~000 vertical feet with them in some pretty rough rock. ,Apr 2020,Jun 3 2020,1
4459,BD Crack gloves!,7,1, Sarah~ you should run a glove resoling business! I used mine for over 12~000 vert in May and now have to tape both pinkies and both wrists. The durability is somewhat acceptable given their thinness and how bad my technique is~ but I still don’t like the thumb coverage. I think it makes my hands far hotter than they would be in OR’s or tape. I don’t use chalk~ so it’s kind of a big deal for me.,Mar 2012,Jun 3 2020,2
4460,BD Crack gloves!,7,2, For those of you who have used and tested these~ do you find these gloves are worth the price when compared to the durability and comfort of tape gloves? I was honestly expecting these to be much cheaper. For reference~ I normally make a pair of tape gloves and they often last me an entire year with minor repairs. I climb mostly sierra granite.,May 2014,Jun 3 2020,0
4461,BD Crack gloves!,7,3, Personally I don’t really like reusable tape gloves. They tend to get smooshed and stuck together if I’m taking them to and from the gym. Also to be as durable as the OR and BD gloves they often have to be thicker than these are. When I make tape gloves I usually subscribe to the stef davis montra of single use only. For me these are primarily for training when I would go through a lot of tape or I want to do some quick laps without having to take the time to tape up. ,Aug 2014,Jun 3 2020,3

4463,BD Crack gloves!,7,5, FWIW I started looking for the Johnson & Johnson athletic tape in 32 pack cases. Got my last case for under $60. Convenience is a big factor~ as is the deteriorating performance of tape gloves after reuse. The environmental concerns are probably a wash when you consider that the gloves are shipped from overseas and still require tape to fortify the wrist~ and that tape gloves burn quite nicely. With all that said~ I might just go with a case of tape after the BD’s get blown out. ,Mar 2012,Jun 3 2020,0
4464,BD Crack gloves!,7,6, I still like the Ocun hand jammies over tape since I can take them off quickly mid pitch if I want to (jammies for rough basalt splitter fist crack for 80 feet into hands free~ followed by face climbing for example). I try not to wear tape or jammies at all~ but will definitely choose to do so if it's something like fists~ OW~ or sustained hands. Even with good~ slow~ precise technique I still eventually gobie on things like fist cracks. ,Mar 2014,Jun 3 2020,1

4467,BD Crack gloves!,7,9, I think they are reasonably comfortable. They don't make a huge difference while doing face moves~ as long as the wrist strap isn't overly tight. Economics? I dunno.

4479,BD Crack gloves!,8,1, Yeah probably. If it’s a constriction and your hanging off your wrist. I generally find that painful to start with. Also~ splitter fists aren’t a problem. I’ve tried that out already. I mentioned this caveat in my original post but it’s worth reiterateing for anyone considering doing this mod. Climbed an OW last night ranging from hand’s to double fist stacks with no problem. I mainly use these for high mileage training or quick crag trips where taping eats up too much of my climbing time. But they are working well enough that I may start using them instead of tape on a lot of other trips too. FWIW there are also silicon grommets and other materials out there too if anyone wants to give those a try. Those would remove a lot of the pain concern but may not be any more durable than he original bd setup. Just google oval grommets and you’ll see a lot of stuff. I measured the oval at 17mm in length and 4mm in width with some crappy harbor freight calipers. I’d be really interested if anyone else finds a good fit,Aug 2014,Jun 13 2020,0

The glove delaminates at the knuckles 2. The Velcro seam tears out and the Velcro strap loses its sticky 3. The loop as has been pointed out years. I have a sewing machine so I double reinforced all those points- the one thing that cannot be corrected is the loss of the texture on the glove after shoving your hands into crack after crack. Wish I could order a new pair~ absolutely love how well they work before they fall apart (3~000 vertical feet maybe.),Apr 2020,Jun 16 2020,1
4484,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,0,,Nov 2019,Jun 15 2020,1
4485,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,1, So the idea is: Nylon slings could be made weaker by using less material to get compete better with dyneema slings in size/weight. The motivation being it's plausible that between a 22kN dyneema sling~ and some significantly weaker nylon sling~ the dyneema presents a significantly higher risk of harm to the user. I guess maybe...I think we'd have to understand how the 22kN figure was arrived. Possibly it was just made up by some authority as something high enough that it ought to safe enough. Maybe it can be dropped a lot without much change to the number of users falling out of the sky. It's not a super interesting safety concern for me~ I and most people I know have no issues trading weight for an item that shouldn't be fallen on. There's also the wet/frozen side of materials in climbing~ but I live in a flat warm place.,Apr 2015,Jun 15 2020,1
4486,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,2, Both are strong enough to not worry about and dynema skinny slings are so much nicer to use. The important rule is you shouldn't be putting yourself in a situation where you could be falling on either. It's fun to nerd out on this stuff~ but it gets to the point that strength just doesn't matter anymore and ergonomics is the decider.,Feb 2018,Jun 15 2020,5
4487,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,3, I feel like this comes up every month or so~ the solution to not taking a potentially dangerous fall factor 2 fall onto a dyneema sling is: don't take a fall factor 2 fall onto a dyneema sling~ it's not difficult. If you want a skinnyish nylon sling just use edelrid tech webbing and ask your self~ why does a sling need to be dynamic?,Oct 2015,Jun 15 2020,7

4492,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,8, We used to use 9/16” nylon super tape slings. Loop sewn strength around 19 kn. Handled like a dream.  Knotting slings~ especially single strand~ can drop strength a lot. You are looking at 5-6 kn for dynema or supertape. 1” tube can hold double that.,Mar 2020,Jun 15 2020,0

4494,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,10,  Bottom line is~ sling don't need to be dynamic and certainly don't need to be any cheaper. I'm consistently shocked whenever I go buy sling (all dyneema) at just how cheap they are.,Oct 2015,Jun 16 2020,3
4495,Nylon vs Dynema Slings,1,11, Bottom line is~ sling don't need to be dynamic and certainly don't need to be any cheaper. I'm consistently shocked whenever I go buy sling (all dyneema) at just how cheap they are. Me too~ I don't destroy them quick enough to care if I am spending $5-8 per sling. They last me five years usually unless they get cut....which means they did their job. Same goes for ropes~ I have one I noticed after climbing Sunday I will have to trim about 10 feet off due to a sheath getting abraded to the point where you can see core. Did its job.,Jul 2015,Jun 16 2020,0

For backpacking:  one of those good inflatable camping pillows.  Sure~ I used to just wad up my puffy jacket in a stuff sack and call it good~ but I'm getting old~ and sleeping uncomfortably hurts more now~ so for the price of a few ounces and the space of a raquetball in my pack~ I can actually get restful sleep.

4506,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,0, Looking to add some small cams to my rack. I’m interested in picking up some aliens~ but I keep reading about all the trouble people have had with them. However~ most/all of these posts are from 2018 or earlier. Does anyone have recent experience with them? Are they viable options now~ and if not~ what do you guys recommend as an alternative? (FYI I’d love to pick up some totems but I definitely don’t have the funds currently),Feb 2019,Jun 15 2020,1
4507,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,1, I absolutely love the Alien Revolutions. I have recently purchased new revos to add to my existing rack of Aliens of both styles (original and revos) and will continue to buy more. I have never had any issues with either version (but i never used the Alien Evolution that came out between these styles). I've only recently had to replace a blue (original style) because i took some repeated whips on it in the desert in a funky placement~ but that one cam was at least 5 years old. I've only considered the new WC Zeros and DMM Dragonflies as a possible replacement to the Aliens~ but I haven't been fully convinced on that yet. ,Oct 2011,Jun 15 2020,1
4508,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,2, Totem basics and master cams.   Zeros and dfs are too floppy.  ,Feb 2017,Jun 15 2020,1
4509,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,3, I’m in the master cams and dragon flies camp myself,Apr 2019,Jun 15 2020,1
4510,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,4, My only complaint with Alien Revos is that they aren't very durable. They definitely work~ but I'm replacing mine with other small cams as they are getting too banged up to keep using (I expect they will become fixed pretty soon). It's going to be hard to lose that blue alien though. That thing has saved my butt quite a few times. I've been thinking about trying the Z4s. The stiff/flexible thing seems awesome~ but I haven't actually tried the smaller sizes yet. They are hard to find right now though.,Feb 2017,Jun 15 2020,0
4511,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,5, I don't think it matters much. dragonflies~ mastercam~ aliens~ Z4~ X4~ they all all work. I can confirm they all fit into cracks and hold your whips.  If you're on a budget~ get what's cheapest~ or better yet~ buy used,Feb 2015,Jun 15 2020,4
4512,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,6, For the easier things I climb~ the Metolius UL Mastercams seem fine.  They cost less and are more durable than my Fixe aliens~ mainly due to having non-bendable trigger wires and harder lobe alloy. That said~ I do have a black Totem and it just... works better in placements than the Metolius blue.  I rarely feel like it's necessary at my level though~ the blue Metolius is fine.,Sep 2018,Jun 15 2020,1
4513,Fixe Aliens in 2020?/Small Cam Recommendations,1,7, The 8kn yellow DF is a deciding factor for me.That is purple Metolius size. Still have tcus and x4s but they are in the closet at the moment. Ditched Alien Revolutions after breaking trigger wires on two units and replacements had identical trigger wire attachement method. ,Nov 2017,Jun 15 2020,1

I'm based in Seattle - not sure if anyone knows of anything out here!

4518,Resoling shoes (based in seattle),1,4, I've had mediocre results in terms of quality from Dave Page- rand caps ruined the toebox on one pair. I've gotten decent results on resoles without randcaps though. May depend on which of his employees does the job.

4527,Resoling shoes (based in seattle),1,13, The point is that the OP is looking for a local resolder and they are local to the PNW and are a very good option in my experience with multiple pairs of shoes. Seattle is like 350 miles from Bend. I guess a trip to Smith isn't out of the question for a Seattleite but Bend is still another 45 minutes further from Smith and it would still require the shoes getting shipped back at least. If I were going to go through any of those hassles I would just send the shoes to a resoler that has much more consistent results.,Jul 2014,Jun 15 2020,0
4528,Resoling shoes (based in seattle),1,14, The point is that the OP is looking for a local resolder and they are local to the PNW and are a very good option in my experience with multiple pairs of shoes. i'm thinking if $ is a key consideration~ spending some $ and getting garbage in return is something the OP would rather avoid.,Dec 2004,Jun 15 2020,1

4536,Ordered a Valley Giant 9...,9,2, This is a very classic Valley Giant situation. Great cams~ but poor customer service. My cam came a couple months late with no replies until the piece was shipped. Friends of mine have gone 6 to 9 months since purchase with minimal or no responses.  Hey Tom~ if you ever see this~ you make an incredible piece of equipment that is worth the weight~ I mean wait. Why not say from the start that it could be 3 to 9 months? I've put my Valley Giants through hell and I know they hold up and still catch big falls~ but poor customer service keeps me from wanting to continue purchasing from you.,Dec 2011,Apr 6 2020,11
4537,Ordered a Valley Giant 9...,9,3, Search the forums and you will hear this story time and time again. Personally i received my 9 and 12 in 2019~ about 1 year after payment. I checked in with him maybe 2-3 times during that time period. He’s clearly established enough of a reputation that people keep paying up front all these years later. Erick at Merlin had anywhere from a 2-4 month turn around. With updates he’s applying to his cams~ and BD entering the big cam market~ I wonder what will happen with Merlin Rock Gear. Don’t think he was getting rich~ think it was a service to the climbing community~ and hobby~ so that may be over. Guess we’ll see.  And then there is now BD. Question mark on how long they will offer these items~ hopefully indefinitely. ,Sep 2017,Apr 6 2020,3

4549,Climbing Stores in Central California,1,0, Other than REI in Sacramento and Fresno~ there’s close to zero options for climbers to buy / try on climbing equipment in the central California region. With the abundant amount of quality bouldering~ sport and trad climbing throughout the “Gold Country” area north of Yosemite~ this is surprising. Online shopping doesn’t cut it when dealing with shoes or anything you need physical feedback from before purchasing.  Does anyone else residing in the central region of California experience the same frustrations? REI seems to have a pretty basic in-store inventory that would leave an experienced trad / aid climber bummed after a 2 hour drive to the nearest location.  Who else would enjoy a good technical climbing store in the Gold Country?  Let me know what you think. This may be on the horizon. ,Aug 2019,Jun 5 2020,2

4559,Fish Atom Smasher,1,0, Looking into picking one of these up to use as a crag pack. Anyone used one for this purpose? What do you love / dislike about the pack. It looks pretty rad to me.,Jul 2015,Sep 2 2016,0
4560,Fish Atom Smasher,1,1, It's great.    Holds all your crap and is super durable.   That said~ it doesn't have a padded back or frame like a normal pack so you have to take a little care loading your gear so a cam lobe isn't digging into your spine.    Also~ it's a top loader so get used to rummaging around at the bottom for stuff.    Great for shorter approaches. Wouldn't recommend hiking with it for over half an hour though.,Nov 2006,Sep 2 2016,2

4563,Fish Atom Smasher,1,4," It's awesome; I've had mine for 5 years and have beat the crap out of it. No other crag pack will stand up to the abuse a smasher can take~ and the price is right. I have no dislikes; it is a super tough tube of fabric to dump all my shit in.   I recommend getting the ""delux"" version with the draw cord on the top.   As far as size~ I can fit a rope~ double rack~ shoes~ helmet~ harness~ water~ and a bit of food in mine. Everything I need for a day of cragging.

The Fish sac will outlive you unless you are hauling it~ the Cilogear would as well~ but it's made out of Cordura. If you are Mostly carrying it any amount of time~ Cilogear. Mostly hauling: Fish~ but you'll hate hiking it in-) . ,Mar 2006,Sep 2 2016,4
4568,Fish Atom Smasher,1,9, Another vote for the Atom Smasher. It's my second. Wore out the first one (but I bought it moderately beat up already from a guy who was hauling it).   I took an old foam pad and cut it to fit the inner diameter of the pack~ rolled up end to end. Works perfectly for padding the back and keeping the bag stiff so it stands on it's own.  I recommend laying a nice thick bead of seamgrip across all the seams on the bottom when you get it - the seams are raised and consequently all the wear on the bottom is concentrated right there.,Nov 2009,Sep 2 2016,1
4569,Fish Atom Smasher,1,10, I have one~ its awesome. Got it for walls and ended up using it as my go-to crag pack. You'll get used to packing the #5 away from your back. Definitely worth it~ and you're supporting an awesome small business while you're at--and getting a damn good deal.,Jan 2011,Sep 2 2016,1
4570,Fish Atom Smasher,1,11, Atom Smasher is a great pack. Carries well~ especially if you flake your rope into the bottom of the pack.   Cilogear is great~ but you will wait a long time to get your pack unless you happen to find one on the shelf. My Cilogear orders have taken from 3-8 months.

4575,Fish Atom Smasher,1,16, The deluxe fish atom smasher is perfect for grade V’s or over nights. Usually the bag naturally packs light enough to haul with a tag line no problem. Not the best to hike with when totally full but otherwise it’s okay. There is some adjustability that’s worth dialing in for a longer heavier hike.  It’s also a great crag pack. I like flaking the rope in bottom of the bag and using like a rope bucket. The minimal gear organization clips are nice but you can’t load it up with gear. But keeping extra clippies and belay gloves/devices is nice to keep on top. The inside zip stash pocket is great so when you dump everything out you don’t break your pipe!  The buy Russ a beer button totally helps get your gear faster.,Oct 2013,May 17 2020,3

4585,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,1,0, Hey guys~ Just looking for a recommendation on a lightweight face covering for multipitch belays (because of covid). I was thinking of getting the Buff CoolNet UV+ because I might be able to use it in the future for other full sun exposure activities. I’m just not sure if it’s a little thick~ or would be too hot. I would be interested to hear from some other Buff owners to see what their experience is with using that product when it’s hot out. Or if they know of a thinner version than the CoolNet UV+. Definitely open to alternatives~ though. Thanks in advance!,Jul 2019,Jun 11 2020,0

Biggest question is whether you wear glasses or not. With glasses (I wear them~ can't wear contacts) I've found the best covering are the closed loop bandanas with elastic tops to keep them up work well because the open bottom allows breath to go down easier c as using less fogging of the glasses.,Jan 2007,Jun 11 2020,2

4599,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,1,14, Have used my Buff UV 100+ days in warm/hot conditions~ hiking in the desert etc. I don't find it unreasonably warm~ definitely more comfortable to have it on than not.

4600,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,1,15, I have been wearing a Buff when out in public~ doubled over most of the time.  It is a bit hotter than a cotton mask and fogs my glasses~ but it is convenient around the neck.  I have worn it when sport cragging a few times; pull it up when your partner or others are nearby~ and drop it when you are distanced.,Sep 2016,Jun 11 2020,0
4601,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,1,16, Background:  I'm well into the age-determined Covid danger zone~ and much more importantly~ my wife has comorbidities that in combination would probably be fatal if I brought Covid home.  So the whole discussion for us is far from the academic exercises being conducted by those who do not view either the personal risk of infection or the possibility of being asymptomatic and infecting someone else as serious issues. I haven't been climbing since early March~ but of course I make trips to grocery and drug stores. I also do quite a bit of solo outdoor fast-hiking on trails with very few people. I'm required by New York State to wear a mask in public places~ but would be using one in any case for the reasons described above.  I've used a buff~ a paper mask~ a cloth mask (Hyperlite Mountain Gear makes a tightly-woven cloth one that is superior to bandannas and buffs)~ and most recently a KN95 mask~ which of course is better than the others in terms of porousness. In addition to having the least protective capacity~ I found the buff to be the least comfortable alternative. It not only covers your face~ but a good part of your neck~ so it's hotter than a mask that leaves your neck open.  As far as the other three types go~ I don't find any one of them harder to breath through than the others~ and the KN95 is of course the most protective.  It is stiff compared to the others~ and isn't going to squish well into a pocket if you intend to carry it while climbing and put it on for belays only---clipping it to a biner would work better.,Feb 2008,Jun 12 2020,10

4604,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,1,19, Surgical masks are far more effective than regular cloth. Surgical masks are basically 1-ply n95s. They're made of a similar melt blown plastic fabric and use electrostatic charge to capture some particles. You need something like 10 layers of regular fabric to match a surgical mask. A single buff that moves less air than a surgical mask is probably worse than a 20 cent mask.,Jun 2019,Jun 12 2020,1
4605,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,1,20, Demetri~ the buff works fairly well. I have some merino ones~ and one from phunkshun that I prefer because the fabric seems to stay cooler against skin. That said~ there are downsides to the buff for this purpose. Keeping it in place while climbing is tough~ and if you're wearing sunglasses it sucks. Overlaps with glasses on your face and they tend to fog.  I've been using a homemade mask that works great. Made by removing the core stands from some parachute cord~ and slipping some wire into the sheath. The p-cord can either go over your ears and around your head~ or over ears and then under your chin. I use a small cord lock to keep tension. The wire inside the p-cord stops just short of my ears. This makes it moldable over your nose and cheeks~ making room for glasses and providing a better fit that is less annoying~ stays in place well and is more comfortable. I cut up an old bandana and used it for the mask. It has a small section stitched for the p-cord to go through~ and elastic sewn into the part that wraps under my chin.  It fits snuggly and unlike the buff~ there isn't fabric going around your whole head and neck which keeps things much cooler. It also is easy to pull down and let hang around your neck~ but does generally take two hands to put back up. Good luck!,Apr 2006,Jun 12 2020,0

Mine are no-name brand. They don't breathe all that well~ but most likely you're going to pull it down as soon as the guide leaves the belay and not put it back on until the move onto the next belay ledge so in this case I think ease of on/off takes priority over breathability.

The primary and most important mode of transmission for COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs~ sneezes~ or talks. Based on data from lab studies on COVID-19 and what they know about similar respiratory diseases~ it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth~ nose~ or possibly their eyes~ but this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads. ,Jan 2007,Jun 12 2020,0
4617,Face Covering for Multipitch Belays,2,11, We agree on so much. The word “primarily” modifying respiratory droplets as the cause is my diversion.  Not sure about why you reference the exhalation valve N95. I certainly agree that some benefit is obtained from wearing a mask by those who are symptomatic to prevent some even most of the viral load. The danger comes from both the belief in better than delivered protection as well as the harm from the social ills created by everyone wearing a mask when not needed.  The hardness of a quarantine I accept. The harshness~ to include those situations that wearing a mask is virtually ineffective~ I need to speak out.  The King while wearing no clothes sports a cotton mask. Separation~ limiting contacts~ hygiene~ care for others~ awareness especially for those susceptible due to comorbidities~ flattening the curve~ search for treatments and vaccines. I bet we agree on all those.,May 2020,Jun 12 2020,1

There is much anticipation~ grinding of teeth~ and a little useful info about them here and here but I hope to consolidate thoughts and opinions in this thread from climbers who have actually have climbed in them. I'll start~ but my intro post should only be considered a ""first look"" or an ""unboxing"" review since I only have two days in them. I added a lot of pictures to compare them to other shoes. Disclaimer - I am a long time Five Ten fanboy (they are the only shoes that really fit me well) but have no affiliation with Five Ten. I have worn through four pairs of TC Pros~ each with one or two resoles; so will make some obvious comparisons to TCs and other similar Five Ten shoes.The long story short~ for me~ is the Grandstones have been worth the wait and I have yet to find something I don't like about them~ yet. They are a welcome and overdue additional to the trad shoe market. The Grandstones toe shape is somewhere between an Anasazi and Quantum. I think I still prefer the Anasazi toe but the Grandstones are pretty close but feel a little more pointy like the Quantum~ but are more asymmetrical than the TCs. Left to right from most to least asymmetrical~ Grandstone is second from left:",Apr 2014,Oct 4 2019,36

4636,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,5, My first impression of the shoe after a day of climbing was less than impressed.  I felt the shoe was too stiff to be a good all day trad shoe.   Well I spent all day yesterday climbing in them again and I’m changing my tune and becoming more and more impressed with it.  It is breaking in very quick~ hopefully not too quick but it edges great and is starting to smear more easily.  I’m still really impressed with the construction and how well made it is.   I think this shoe is quickly becoming my favorite. ,Apr 2012,Oct 5 2019,4
4637,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,6, Construction is much better.  I had the tongue of an old Gstone rip out while pulling on the shoe.,Apr 2012,Oct 5 2019,4

4639,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,8, This has been my experience too. With the break-in~ I have had some stretch too. I am a little paranoid that they will get too sloppy with a lot of use~ since that was my experience with Quantums and new Pinks. I agree about the quality of the construction and their comfort continues to impress me.,Apr 2014,Oct 7 2019,1
4640,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,9, Recived a pair in 44 (eur) yesterday and tried them out in the gym. Fit :   I'm a street shoe 44~ 5.10 verdon 43~ fairly normal foot~ and I found the 44 Grandstone to fit quite perfektly as for lenght. But I really had to work a bit to get it on as it feels wery tight around the forefoot~ not necessarily in the widht~ but in the height of the forefoot. It really grips your foot and holds it in place. I don't see how anyone with a wide foot could fit them. I want this to be an comfortable all day trad shoe~ It definetely needs some braking in before I can take it to the mountains.,Apr 2017,Oct 9 2019,1
4641,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,10, I bought a pair of pre-production sample Grandstones a while back and went with street size (9). I compared them to my size 9 new Blancos and the sole is basically the same shape if I remember correctly. But initially the Grandstones felt much tighter~ which I believe is due to the uppers being less stretchy than my Blancos and Pinks. So what I did was use my shoe stretcher to widen out the uppers a bit and now they fit like a glove. Therefore~ my guess would be to fit the Grandstones for length and assume they'll break in width-wise over time. For reference~ Anasazi lasts are my perfect foot shape. I've not used Quantums so I can't compare to them. I use Butora Altura wide 9.5 as my main offwidth shoe and compared to those the Grandstones edge better but are much more painful for wide cracks due to the downturn. Heel-toe cams and stacked feet that are easy in the Butoras are torture in the Grandstones. The Grandstones handle thin cracks better than the Butoras but I mostly use an old pair of Anasazi Verdes for thin cracks so I haven't done much thin stuff in the Grandstones. I'm mostly a gym climber so it's easy for me to switch shoes to the best one for the given crack~ but I could see the Grandstones being my main all-round outdoor shoe after my Pinks wear out. I bouldered for quite a bit in the Grandstones as well just to test them out and they performed pretty well with the downturn and toe rubber. Here's how my other shoes have sized in case it helps folks with sizing - Street: 9 - Grandstones: 9. Comfy (after stretching uppers wider) toes mostly flat - Blancos: 9. Toes mostly flat - Pinks: 8.5 toes mostly flat - Verdes: 9 toes completely flat - Evolv Shaman 9.5 curled - Butora Acro wide 9 toes curled and have to take off after every problem - Butora Altura wide 9.5 toes flat - Scarpa Techno X 8.5 toes mostly flat. A bit narrow for me.,Nov 2018,Oct 11 2019,2
4642,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,11, Taking a bit of a risk~ I first wore the Grandstones first out on Charlotte Dome this weekend to break them in.  They were sized a half sized up from my street shoe so I could wear sock liners.  My toes still had a slight curl.  They were very comfortable. The concave bottom flattened out immediately. It felt like a trad shoe.,Mar 2018,Oct 15 2019,0

4644,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,13, I would if possible buy two pair.  I have a pair of Gstones in my street shoe and they have fairly quickly broken in to a all day shoe.   For single pitch or shorter routes where you really want good edging I would size down so the downturn is maintained.  I plan on getting a size down in the future just for that reason. ,Apr 2012,Oct 15 2019,0
4645,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,14, I tried these in the gym at a 5.10 event and liked them.  I don't have other hightops for comparison~ but other folks mentioned that they actually feel less stiff laterally that TC Pros. One complaint was that the rubber does not completely cover the toebox.  On one sizd rack~ my buddy gave up almost immediately because when he cammed his foot over~ the leather part of the shoe was what was taking the brunt of the force~ which compressed the knuckle on his toe to a very uncomfortable degree.,Jun 2014,Oct 15 2019,0
4646,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,1,15, I don't really think a full rubber toe box is needed for crack  climbing but it certainly wouldn't hurt~ look at the Mocs and most any other shoes that are popular for crack and they have very little rubber covering the toes if any.  I do think it's odd that where manufacturers do place the rubber~ over the big toe and I get that for hooking but most of the time you are crack climbing the orientation of toes in the crack are big toe up little toe down and much of the contact is over the little toe.  Why not have a full toe cap for that reason?  Seems it would add in the friction and help a little but the compromise is that it's a little thicker.   I think the Anasazi Pros are a full toe cap but there aren't too many others.,Apr 2012,Oct 15 2019,1

That is why the gap on this shoe was a problem.  With the big toe up~ the gap sits over the 3rd or 4th toe knuckle~ so when he cammed his foot~ the force was right there.  It looks like the shape of the rubber is a bit of a 5.10 signature~ but the gap seems larger here than it does on the other shoes.  I climb outside in 5.10 Stonelands~ and those seem to have a smaller gap over the toes.  The TC pros have only a tiny split over the toebox.  The friend in question normally climbs in a pair of Mythos~ and those have full coverage over the toe box.  The Evolv General has more coverage with a supplemental bit of rubber~ and the old Astromans also had more toe box coverage. It seems to be more a stylistic choice than anything else~ and it does not make a ton of sense in my mind for an all day trad oriented shoe.,Jun 2014,Oct 15 2019,0

4653,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,2,1, I've been a long time Grandstone wearer.  I anxiously waited for the new ones to come out as I blew out my last pair of the old ones.  I climbed with the new ones twice in the gym~ and then took them to Seneca this weekend for a proper break in.  They seem to be improved in all the ways I'd want~ and didn't lose anything from the originals that I would see as a negative.  I suppose the toe rubber on the originals was a little better for cracks~ with the full coverage over the toes~ but it also could prove to be uncomfortable at times if you sized down at all.  I haven't experienced any discomfort on the gym cracks~ or jamming cracks at Seneca with the new toe box like an earlier poster mentioned~ they felt great to me.  They also seemed to be more comfortable and easier to get on and off than the old ones.  They certainly edge better than the old ones which was key.  That little bit of extra stiffness~ the slight down turn~ and the slight change of shape made this seem to perform much better than my old pair.  All in all I'm extremely happy I waited for these.  ,Apr 2012,Oct 21 2019,1

4660,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,2,8, Alright- finally got my hands on a pair. I only climb in Grandstones.  My old pairs are going on .... WAY too many resoles so I'm eager to find a new shoe.  At first contact I'm a bit disappointed.  Ordered a pair in the same size as all my other pairs and... barely could get them on my feet~ so the sizing is smaller.  They seem better constructed~ but with the better construction came an edge roll both at the lace area and heel which placed a painful pressure point in both spots when I walked around the house with them. The old flat~ un-reinforced  leather edges did not create pressure points. The toe box is a tad narrower and they are definitely stiffer~ which is going to make it a bit harder to use it as an all day shoe.  I'm mailing them back and I'll reorder a 1/2 size larger ~ but I'm concerned the redesign may be incompatible with my feet. :(,Mar 2009,Dec 5 2019,0
4661,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,2,9, Skip~ I had the same concern about size when I got mine.   By the end of a few routes the first day my toes were killing me and I was worried I made a huge mistake.   After a few more days the shoe seemed to stretch out to the point now that I may go down a size in my next pair and keep the one pair for all day routes and the smaller size for cragging.   ,Apr 2012,Dec 5 2019,0

4666,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,2,14, To add to the conversation~ I ordered a pair online on October 13 and have climbed about 50 pitches in them over various weekends since then.  I find them extremely comfortable and the build quality has been impressive. They edge extremely well and the C4 still bites beautifully on the Southern AZ granite we have on Mt. Lemmon. They felt clunky the first few pitches~ but I had been climbing in well-worn TC Pros and Miura VSs up until that point. After the first day~ I was trusting them on very small edges and they were smearing comfortably. I haven't taken them up any cracks~ so I can't speak to that.  They have flattened out a little bit in the arch and toe box~ but they still support the mid-foot/arch of the foot very well. No foot fatigue at all in them. I haven't noticed any stretch... yet. I sized them at SS size: 9.5. For reference~ with 5.10~ I wear the following:,Jun 2019,Dec 6 2019,4

4694,The (Un)Official 2019 Five Ten Grandstone Thread,4,2, Well- if anyone gives a rats ass about updates- up a half size and wore the shoes for about 3 weeks.  They remained totally uncomfortable in spite of every effort to break them in. I even just hiked around in them for a few days.  The redesigned shape of this shoe is incompatible with my feet.  I cant go another size larger since there is room in the heel while simultaneously being too tight in the front.  The reinforced heel roll digs into my ankle and the joint of leather at the third lace bends and creates a very painful pressure point. I even tried a few different lacing configurations that helped but didn't fix the problem.  I had to sell them .

4704,Other failure modes of the link cams,1,0, Have had a couple of link cams 2.0 and 0.75 for a while that I occasionally rack if I'm on the fence about bringing a double rack but not sure on what sizes I would want to double up on.   Pretty aware of the issue with making sure the stem is aligned with the direction of pull and preventing the cam from rotating in a fall. I tend to put a sling on them most of the time to keep them in place.   A bit less clear on a second failure mode regarding falling with the hinge loaded?   Does that mean that they shouldnt be placed in the range where the hinge part of the lobe is contacting the rock? Also noticed that the published useful range is limited quite a bit on the large end of the range.  Curious on the reasoning for that? Obviously I know that they aren't useful placed passively but the upper end of the useful range seems a bit smaller than expected,Jan 2012,Jun 10 2020,0

4708,Coolest summer climbing pants,1,1, OR Voodoo for me in one of the lighter colors. Edit: Per Rexford below~ the Ferrosi fabric is cooler and a lighter than the Voodoo. I chatted w/ OR. Both are 90 denier (which I learned is a measure of fabric thickness) but the Voodoo blend has a little more nylon (88% vs. 86%) and a little less spandex~ so Voodoo a little more abrasion resistant (mine have lasted forever) and warmer.,Sep 2016,Jun 10 2020,1

4717,Coolest summer climbing pants,1,10, Another vote for the OR Ferrosi - specifically the Ferrosi Crag pants~ which may be a hair warmer that the regular Ferrosi due to reinforced knees~ but a really nice crag pants. they redesigned them this season and the cut is way better than the first version. I highly recommend this pant. Some thoughts on the other suggestions: OR Voodoo's are much warmer~ avoid Pantagonia Hampi could be the coolest pants I have used but are discontinued~ and look and feel like dress pants too Prana's feel similar to Ferrosis but don't breathe anywhere near as well so feel much warmer (but have the largest cult following) BD Alpine Light are almost as cool as Ferrosis but have a horrible baggy cut~ not good for rock climbing,Oct 2018,Jun 11 2020,1

4738,MSR midclip snowpicket,1,0, Hey Folks.  It's been a while since I used for snow pickets~ but I'm thinking of getting back into the picket game~ with generally warmer~ less consolidated snow on some alpine routes over here in the Alps.  I bought a couple of new MSR mid-clip snow pickets.  They're basically the same snow picket I remember~ with a few new touches~ like a little hammer plate on the top~ and a thick cable permanently attached to the center hole.  I like the permanent attachment--that will likely encourage climbers to place these pickets with the pull oriented from the middle of the picket~ as opposed to the top.  However~ the cable is thick and heavy. I used to girth hitch my pickets with a double length sling.  I looked at the hole on new picket; the inner diameter is a bit champfered but it's not too sharp.  I'm a little worried about sling-to-metal contact there...but not too much.  Anyway~ I'm thinking of cutting off the thick~ heavy~ single-use aluminum cable~ and using a light~ versatile double length runner~ carried independently~ or girth hitched to the middle hole in preparation for use.  Thoughts?  Any good reasons to stick to the cable? Also~ related questions~ I also picked up a few of the rather snazzy~ relatively light~ MSR flukes in size large. They look good~ and I'll experiment with them soon.  Preferences/thoughts regarding pickets vs. flukes for protecting snow ascents? All the best~  B,Dec 2009,Jun 10 2020,0
4739,MSR midclip snowpicket,1,1, I’ve used the Yates midclip pickets that msr copied to produce these.  The cable allows you to place the picket more or less as a fluke allowing you more options when anchoring. It’s for sure heavy~ but definitely worth it. Google the NZ snow picket study for some data on the different applications and uses for snowpickets. ,Oct 2007,Jun 10 2020,0
4740,MSR midclip snowpicket,1,2, all of my pickets are older and none have cables...so i won't comment directly on that. i suspect that either using the cable or slinging is fine.  i did want to mention a special word on flukes.  here in CO we generally have a shitty snow pack and vertically placed pickets rarely work well. However~ flukes work VERY well for a number of reasons: 1. they tend to be stable within the layer of snow they are placed 2. when they fail~ they don't fail catastrophically like a picket. they slide within the snowpack. But flukes are also annoying for other reasons~ mainly due to the care you need to exercise when placing them (which is why you don't really see them used in running belays). Below is a snow anchor built with 2 flukes. We pull tested it to 800 lbs without failure...,Dec 2014,Jun 10 2020,0
4741,MSR midclip snowpicket,1,3, Thanks for the replies so far.  Max~ do you mean this study? https://1n4f2w2vitg0171iz73r565o-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Snow-Anchors0705.pdf,Dec 2009,Jun 10 2020,0
4742,MSR midclip snowpicket,1,4, The cable is for a mid-clipping which is fast and strong. If the snow conditions are appropriate for this type of placement a nylon runner won't be able to cut through the snow the same way the cable does. I love these personally and would highly recommend keeping the cable. Here's a video of how to place it: youtu.be/sfGNZA7nEl8?t=157,Mar 2016,Jun 10 2020,0

4744,Rubber patch on La Sportiva G5,5,0, Hey everybody– I just picked up a new pair of G5s~ and I noticed that some sizes (44) had a rubber patch over the outside ankle that is not pictured on Sportiva's site (sportiva.com/g5.html). Not necessarily a problem~ I'm just wondering if anybody knows what it is.,Aug 2015,Jun 6 2020,0
4745,Rubber patch on La Sportiva G5,5,1, I think it's extra protection from/for the BOA knob which is right under the rubber patch. ,Apr 2006,Jun 6 2020,0
4746,Rubber patch on La Sportiva G5,5,2, That's what I figured. Any idea why some sizes have it and others don't?,Aug 2015,Jun 6 2020,0
4747,Rubber patch on La Sportiva G5,5,3, If I had to guess~on smaller sizes the zipper will run more to the outside of the boot (zipper stays same size)~ and there is not enough space for the patch (likely one size of patch). Just something I have noticed across the industry~ across size runs~ in 1.5 boots with offset zippers. Also~ with different sizes there can be a size-break which denotes whether there is enough pressure on the boat to warrant a patch or not. Extrapolating design to smaller/larger sizes than the prototype (likely sample size 42/38 for m/w respectively) makes all sort of wonky things happen: you are changing distances between components that retain their one size (boa).  Yet another possibility is that someone f'ed up on the first production run for size 44~ let's say and a patch was needed to reinforce that area/underlying stich~ and instead of remanufacturing it turned out to be cheaper to just add patches to >= 44 for the lifetime of production. I would like to think it's not that but crazier things happen in boot production land.,Nov 2012,Jun 6 2020,2
4748,Rubber patch on La Sportiva G5,5,4, That makes a lot of sense. Thank you!,Aug 2015,Jun 8 2020,0
4749,Rubber patch on La Sportiva G5,5,5, The ones with the added rubber are from a newer production run~ an in-line update done without updating the product photos~ etc. I’d try to get a pair with the update if you’re buying new. ,Dec 2014,Jun 10 2020,1
4750,TNF Assault 2 Futurelight...more waterproof? Or other alpine tent recs,1,0, I’m in the PNW so the lack of being fully waterproof with the normal assault 2 definitely won’t cut it~ but otherwise it’s exactly what I’m looking for in a tent. Anybody have experience with the Futurelight version and how waterproof it is? Or any other recommendations? I’ve got a solid base camp tent already and so am looking for something that I can take with me up the volcanoes in the PNW that’s at least somewhat livable for two people~ waterproof~ packs decently small~ and is under 5 lbs-ish. Will mostly get winter or early spring use. Cost isn’t much of a factor but cheaper is always better.I like the Rab Latok summit~ the new Mountain Hardware AC-2 (basically the direkt with heavier fabric and better venting)~ the el dorado~ the Assault 2 (if the Futurelight is actually waterproof) and toying with the idea of an UL shelter like the ZPacks duplex or Tarptent stratosphere Li.Thanks in advance!,Mar 2019,Mar 4 2020,1

I like a 6x8' or so. I had my dad sew me up one from ultralight sil-nylon and it weighs nothing. I used it as a bivy tarp on the Moonflower~ Fitz Roy~ etc. It can be wrapped around you as a bivy sac~ used as a wind shelter and keep of spindrift/snow.

4778,TNF Assault 2 Futurelight...more waterproof? Or other alpine tent recs,2,7, Any of these tents will be waterproof and breathable when brand new. Pro Tip from a former industry insider: When the water repellent coating on the outside fabric wears off (or is killed by UV) water will soak into the the outer nylon rendering it un-breathable despite the waterproof breathable laminate inside being perfectly fine.  Combine this with cold and you now have an active refrigerator condensing warm water vapor inside (from you). Prep your waterproof/breathable fabric before your trip (be it jacket~ pants or tent) with regular scotch guard spray and it will stay far more breathable. If moisture is not beading up on the fabric but instead is laying in sheets the fabric cannot pass water vapor.,Mar 2020,May 21 2020,3
4779,TNF Assault 2 Futurelight...more waterproof? Or other alpine tent recs,2,8," Yeah don't bring UL shelters into the Alpine!  Leave those thru hiker rigs and tarps at home.  You need a real tent up there.  It can be really exposed and windy on a sunny day and far worse during a T storm.   My main criteria in choosing alpine trip tents is will it and all my stuff still be there when I get back? Most alpine trips are long day climbs out of a basecamp~ so bring a nice to live in tent! The more guy lines the better.  If it's more of a ""summer"" alpine and I'm not planning on a bivy~ I just bring a light mosquito net/rainfly backpacking tent.  They weigh as much or less than all your mentioned tents.  I'm currently rolling with a MH Ghost UL 1 at 1lb 11oz.  Great for the bugs or sunshine and totally dry and bombproof when its gusty and pouring rain.",Oct 2010,May 21 2020,1
4780,TNF Assault 2 Futurelight...more waterproof? Or other alpine tent recs,2,9, Just got out with the tent for the first time aaaaand.......... The part of the tent that’s Futurelight is completely 100% waterproof. But there are caveats. Had it out in the rain all night on the Olympic peninsula (we were expecting snow at the altitude we were at) and the only place water got in was a very tiny amount through the seams so I’ll need to seal those. But we did not get at all wet~ nor did our bags and we were definitely pressed up against the walls. The vestibule is not Futurelight material and that wasn’t very waterproof~ but good enough that keeping things in a backpack in the vestibule was fine even with a non-waterproof backpack. Boots were mildly damp but not bad~ so if it’s actually raining again with this tent~ I’ll just have them in my bag. But it did take a few hours of heavy rain for the vestibule to wet out~ so I imagine even with wet snow it will be adequate. So overall I was incredibly impressed as this all was in 13 hours of solid downpour~ not what the tent was designed for. And as a bonus (though it wasn’t very cold)~ there was minimal condensation with just the two small side vents open which are shielded from the rain. Definitely would say that the tent is best suited to the alpine and there are for sure better options for the rain~ but it held up waaaaaaay better than I expected in conditions I never meant to have it out in.,Mar 2019,Jun 8 2020,5

4782,TNF Assault 2 Futurelight...more waterproof? Or other alpine tent recs,2,11, Just some of the seams on the side walls of the tent~ but it was just slightly damp along the seams and ther were no running droplets going down from the seams.

4789,Hardness of Hooks,1,6, Be careful about translating hardness into strength.  You can manipulate just the surface hardness without affecting the majority of the base metal.  However 150 to 160 ksi is a very reasonable strength for steel.   Tensile strength (aka yield strength) is a material property.  You can't translate into strength of a part without knowing the dimensions of the part and how its loaded.,Jan 2009,Feb 2 2017,1

4804,Hardness of Hooks,2,0, I was the originator of this hook design in the early 1970's when I was working for Ed Leeper. I took an aid fall when an original Chouinard narrow base hook rotated off the edge it was on as I watched. I sketched out the original wide base Leeper hook which we made in two versions~ a wide one that was stronger and a narrow one that would fit in a quarter inch bolt hole for when aid bolts pulled out leaving only a hole~ which was actually fairly common. We made the Leeper z pitons out of 4130 steel so that is what we used. We would work with soft annealed sheet and send the finished hooks and pins to Denver to be heat treated. The testing was done by weighting them to failure while hanging off an edge or in a hole. If the hardness was too high they would fail in a brittle fracture. If too soft the hooked tip would open up. In the end we used the same hardness as the pitons as that was convenient. The hardness was relevant and we empirically found the best hardness by testing to failure. I have no idea what anyone does now. That is where the Logan hook came from.,Jul 2004,Feb 3 2017,2

4809,Hardness of Hooks,2,5, I decided against testing in a steel block as the problems I´ve encountered using the Talon was in limestone (I use hooks for positioning while bolting) is that the edged of the flakes often burst out so wanted to know if this is the normal failure mode.    Tested in a 13mm dia hole~ granite block.

4812,Hook questions ,1,1, Hey Man~ I don't think you will ever find a published strength rating on a hook because they are only designed as a body weight/progression piece. If they did include one I suppose it might give someone a bad idea on their capabilities. There are stories of early/home made hooks opening but it is not something that I would ever worry about. Every time a hook has failed me it is because the rock broke away~ not the hook bending. For small edges I think the talon would probably serve you best~ but it really takes practice to judge what hook is best for what edge. Hope that helps.,Jun 2014,Mar 6 2019,3

4820,Re-waterproofing BD Stormline Jacket,1,1, Best thing you may be able to do is try Techwash~ then TX Direct Wash-In. But its never going to be as good as the factory-applied DWR. Jackets like these just have a life-span. Best to keep them as clean as possible~ and wash them rarely~ if ever.,Jan 2014,Jun 9 2020,0
4821,Re-waterproofing BD Stormline Jacket,1,2, NO. The Long Ranger is wrong Every single manufacture of membranes and waterproof jackets tell you to wash them for a reason. If you have dirt and oil on the jacket you are reducing the DWR's ability~ you are reducing the breathability~ and reducing the lifespan of the jacket. Wash you damn waterproof jackets people. And put them in the dryer as well~ the heat helps to refresh the DWR. Arcteryx has a good few vids on it. ,Oct 2011,Jun 9 2020,5
4822,Re-waterproofing BD Stormline Jacket,1,3," You missed~ ""Best to keep them as clean as possible"". Washing a DWR jacket often with regular detergent will take off the DWR coating. Using Techwash/TX Direct is expensive - it'd be cheaper to just buy a new jacket if you wash it religiously. Dirty jackets clog up the pores that make up the inner membrane of a waterproof jacket and yes you should keep them clean~ as performance will drop if they become clogged with oil.  The OP was asking specifically about a jacket that keeps wetting out. That's the DWR needing reapplication. Water should be collecting on the surface of the jacket in droplets - that's the DWR's job. The membrane is for breathability. ",Jan 2014,Jun 9 2020,0

4824,Re-waterproofing BD Stormline Jacket,1,5, Forthright honestly~ I think we're agreeing more than we are disagreeing.  I wash my Goretex stuff about once a year - the jacket wears out before it wetting out. When not in use~ I stow it away and it stays ready. I think problems that products like GoreTex try to solve are a difficult and the tech. isn't perfect. Or... why so much time/money devoted to R&D?

4829,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,1,0," EDIT: Turns out Edelrid did respond after a few days~ it got caught in spam. Sorry Edelrid~ +1 for customer service but the concerns about the product still stand. Well~ my Spoc broke and could have dropped me while being used the way it's supposed to be. I tried messaging Edelrid about this via email and Instagram and haven't gotten any response. As plenty of people are top-rope solo'ing remote crags through this quarantine it seemed necessary to spread the word. Long and short of it~ don't trust your life to one Spoc. Of course~ you should never trust your life to one thing~ but we often do it anyways from time to time  (grigri~ rope~ etc) and I know plenty of people who top rope solo on a single microtrax. The issue is the double attachment points. They're wide enough for the screw of a screwgate to get into~ but then the screw can catch on one plate~ leading to all the load being on  that plate~ leading to an unbalanced load on the axel. This makes the rope push the ""top"" sideplate outwards~ and it can pop out of it's notch and bend/break~ which could release the rope with a bit more twisting/force. I was using a backup~ fortunately~ but this is a pretty significant failure mechanism~ especially because it can (and did) happen while being used per manufacturer's instructions; no slack in the system~ gentle fall~ appropriate carabiner~ etc. Pictures are worth a thousand words...the bending/twisting is worse under full load~ of course",Nov 2019,Apr 17 2020,11

4831,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,1,2," A Microtrax has aluminum side plates too~ and the holes are also big enough to fit over a screwgate.  You should probably change the thread title so you don't just throw Edelrid under the bus~ since this isn't unique to them. Arguably~ this is more a problem of cross-loading than it is with the progress capture device.  There is a reason people use special carabiners to prevent cross-loading in scenarios where it could be fatal~ such as TR solo.  I use a BD Gridlock~ but there are lots of options out there. I'd argue that this is not use ""per manufacturer's instructions.""  TR solo is generally not strictly approved use~ and the ""legal"" recommendation is 2 devices for redundancy so you don't die if this happens.  They also aren't supposed to be use unattended where they can be crossloaded.  Don't get me wrong~ I use them like this too~ but it's kinda at your own risk.

4832,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,1,3," Kyle~ I think it's appropriate to critique a product that can fail when used per the manufacture's instructions~ especially once you've given them a chance to address the issue first (they have not bothered to respond). They made the thing that can easily cross-load to failure~ after all. I sold my Gridlock so I can't test with that~ but I don't think an ""anti-crossloading"" carabiner will fix this. The part that jammed wasn't the spine of the carabiner~ it was the gate~ and the DMM Rhino or whatever wouldn't change that. Even a quicklink has the screw to catch on. This problem is exacerbated by how large the holes in the spoc are; they're much bigger than those on the microtrax. The problem really is the Spoc~ not the carabiner used. A non-locker would be less likely to jam~ but it's still possible~ and using a non-locker opens up other obvious safety concerns.",Nov 2019,Apr 17 2020,1

How does that change the fact that their product broke and could have failed when being used as recommended from a ""fall"" that was really just sitting down?

4844,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,1,15," I used it per instructions as an ascender~ which is what it's doing in a top rope solo situation~ and I follow petzl's recommendations for soloing on a single strand; chest harness on top ascender and backup beneath it. If you bought a grigri and it broke on you catching a routine fall~ you might be a little upset with Petzl.  People can try and turn this into a discussion of top rope soloing techniques if they'd like but that's not the point. Yes~ you should use a chest harness to keep the top ascender oriented correctly~ and use a backup...like I did~ so shove the lectures on ""personal responsibility"".  The point is that the spoc is more likely to fail in this way than other ascender.

4854,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,4, It took me a bit to figure out how to hold the Spoc in the correct orientation ~ and involved a ty wrap and my elastic headlamp strap over my neck ~ but made a world of difference in keeping the device and biner oriented correctly and resulting in a reaffirming sound as it follows the rope.My main concern with the device is exactly what you saw as it was apparent from the get go that the device could easily fall into the worst case loading scenario. I will post pics from next time out on the exact setup and thanks for the reminder ( I had already loaded up without the tywraps for my next outing),Oct 2010,Apr 17 2020,2
4855,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,5, 1. Definitely user error. As others have said~ You should always take steps to ensure the device and carabiner are oriented properly. Dont blame edelrid for this,Jan 2017,Apr 17 2020,15
4856,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,6," Come on~ dude~ posting a ""safety warning"" and showing a carabiner cross-loaded in the device isn't so fair.... I'm willing to go with Josh's experience with it~ that it might hang up like that more than a Micro...but letting your carabiner get cross-loaded in the device then claiming it's a safety issue with a sample size of 1 seems a little unfair to the company....",Sep 2009,Apr 18 2020,17
4857,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,7, The problem is how easy it is to crossload~ even with normal precautions like a chest harness being used. The larger holes make this more possible. Y'all can shoot the messenger as much as you want but this device is more dangerous than alternatives and the community should know.,Nov 2019,Apr 18 2020,3
4858,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,8, CAMP GOBLIN.  Its 2020 people. ,Feb 2020,Apr 18 2020,2
4859,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,9, I also like the twin gate locking carabiners. The carabiner I like even more than that one for TR solo is the Grivel Clepsydra. The bump by the spine keeps the devices perfectly oriented when you aren’t able to watch your device.  I wonder if that bump on the spine is big enough to block rotation of the Spoc? or the Microtrax? I haven't used one~ so I'm not sure. My hesitation would be that the spoc might fit over that bump and it would cause the same failure mode as the OP's post~ but I'm not sure~ since I haven't handled one of these carbines before. Otherwise~ looks great! Looks perfect for a grigri~ though I prefer my megajul (Haters~ commence hating).,Feb 2017,Apr 18 2020,0
4860,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,10, I did this exact thing to my microtraxion. It got cross loaded~ bent the main pin and side plate~ ripped plate open~ but still remained engaged on rope 100%. I was glad for my secondary device that day. ,Aug 2012,Apr 18 2020,5
4861,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,11," ""I did this exact thing to my microtraxion. It got cross loaded~ bent the main pin and side plate~ ripped plate open~ but still remained engaged on rope 100%. I was glad for my secondary device that day.""  This is my point. Sample size of 1~ so we've had one Spoc used outside its norms and it fails...and now a Micro-Trac~ too---my point is not that one is superior to the other or that either device is sketchy...it's that posting a single incident as a trend or as conclusive seems a bit overstated to me..... Use an Edelrid slider locking carabiner and then you've got no barrel/lock to get wedged in there! ",Sep 2009,Apr 18 2020,10
4862,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,12, It would be overstating it if there were no reason to think that the spoc was more susceptible to this failure mode. However~ as it was specifically designed to fit screwgates into the attachment holes~ there is good reason to believe that it will catch and bind on screwgates more easily than devices with smaller holes. ,Nov 2019,Apr 18 2020,0
4863,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,13, Good point. BTW~ THANK YOU for the heads up Anson. Dude' giving folks a heads up never hurts anyone....in fact~ the reverse is true. ,Mar 2006,Apr 18 2020,2
4864,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,14, Good point. BTW~ THANK YOU for the heads up Anson. Dude' giving folks a heads up never hurts anyone....in fact~ the reverse is true.  None of us are giving him a hard time for pointing this out~ just for his insistence that this failure was due specifically to the Spoc's design~ is unique to the Spoc~ and is therefore Edelrid's fault.,Apr 2019,Apr 19 2020,3
4865,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,15, I wonder if that bump on the spine is big enough to block rotation of the Spoc? or the Microtrax? I haven't used one~ so I'm not sure.

Otherwise~ looks great! Looks perfect for a grigri~ though I prefer my megajul (Haters~ commence hating). It definitely blocks the microtrax. Can't say for the spoc,Dec 2016,Apr 19 2020,0
4866,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,16, I'm curious.  Did it fail to the point of you loading your backup or did it just break/deform without dropping you?,Oct 2007,Apr 19 2020,3
4867,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,17, I bought two of these~ and I think this may be an improvement over a normal screwgate.  The micro-trax slides right over the gate (my finger is holding up the micro-trax in this picture).  Not only does it make the screwgate-barrel crossloading situation less likely~ it's actually nice to be able to flip the carabiner gate through the micro-trax.  The process of roping up is slightly less fiddly. Opening the gates one-handed takes a bit of practice.  I just walked around with one in my pocket for a day messing around with it and now it's really easy.,Oct 2017,May 12 2020,4
4868,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,18," I'd be curious how much functional strength is lost by having one ""leg"" popped out like that. I feel like the possibility of the rope escaping the device entirely is low~ and the ""teeth"" would still have (most) of the grab on the rope that they would with the leg fully ""in""~ but the strength lost in having one side unsupported could be troubling. I haven't gotten into TR/Solo yet~ but I do have both the Microtrax & Rollnlock~ and used both in a 3:1 rig for topping a tree at a buddy's place. I like the Rollnlock for the flexibility to use it with a runner or rope~ but the way it ""gives"" some slack out when locking up was mildly irritating in this application...it didn't prevent it from operating properly~ at least.",Jun 2019,Jun 9 2020,0
4869,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,2,19, Use an Oval~ I think the instructions even say you need to use an oval to prevent this from happening.   I had the same happen to me until I figured out I was using the wrong type of biner.,Apr 2012,Jun 9 2020,0

4872,Edelrid Spoc Safety Warning,3,2, Why are you using what is an emergency rescue device for rope soloing? Just because it could be doesn't mean it should~ I could use a tibloc for rope soloing but i don't~ because that would be dumb. ,Oct 2015,Jun 10 2020,0

4898,Another TR solo thread~ Camp Goblin demo,2,2, I can down climb with this no problem. Bonus is~ you can rap on the main line and never take the Goblin off the safety. To down climb~ you do need to disengage the micro or temporarily remove. This is simple too~ by taking completely on the Goblin (safety line) to get slack on the main line. Can also swap out the micro with a gri at that point. I've only needed to downclimb short sections like this. ,Dec 2002,Jun 24 2019,0
4899,Another TR solo thread~ Camp Goblin demo,2,3, awesome thanks for the reply!  So for down climbing~ basically no backup device~ or the grigri is the second device while downclimbing (not just rapping) but the system is no longer self-feeding?  Almost just need two goblins (but $$$).,Jan 2018,Jun 24 2019,0
4900,Another TR solo thread~ Camp Goblin demo,2,4, Correct. No secondary device for downclimbing.. on easier terrain (easy enough to downclimb)~ I use just the Goblin.

4911,Crampons for alpine rock approaches,1,0, Does anyone have a recommendation for the ideal crampons to get for approaching alpine rock in RMNP? I know that they won’t be necessary for most formations as we get further into summer~ but it seems like having a pair is required for getting out earlier in the season. I’m looking for some that I can just strap onto my approach shoes and that would be very lightweight/compact. Thanks in advance!,Apr 2019,Jun 3 2020,0
4912,Crampons for alpine rock approaches,1,1, Multiple brands make exactly that~ just get an aluminum pair that have straps for the toe and the heal.  They will still be a wee bit slippery in the mush. FYI,Apr 2006,Jun 3 2020,2
4913,Crampons for alpine rock approaches,1,2, A lot of options work~ but I switched from aluminum crampons to kahtoola KTS a few years back with no regrets. They work better with trail runners or approach shoes. ,Jan 2011,Jun 3 2020,4

4917,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,0, Hey everyone~ I wear my harness with the waist cinched all the way down which results in this obnoxiously long tail of webbing. Would it be dangerous to cut the webbing down to a more reasonable length~ thereby removing the sewn/folded end? What are your thoughts on climbing in a harness without a sewn fold at the end of the waist strap? Thanks!,Jan 2018,Mar 11 2020,0
4918,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,1, Your harness has belt loops to tuck the excess strap out of the way. The end is designed not to pull through the buckle. Cutting it and leaving it bare has more risk than leaving it and tucking it away. ,Jun 2015,Mar 11 2020,6
4919,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,2, There is still 8+ inches of webbing flopping around when it is tucked through the belt loops,Jan 2018,Mar 11 2020,0

4926,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,9, I think that there is no risk if you cut it down and then knot the end with any stopper knot that won't slip. I would personally only cut off a few inches at most though. Be careful not to cut off too much~ or you'll either ruin the harness or be forced to make a compromise on what you're comfortable with in terms of tail length (which would not be advisable).,Mar 2014,Mar 11 2020,1
4927,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,10, Me too. Works like a charm.,Jul 2009,Mar 11 2020,2
4928,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,11, I buy my harnesses on the large end to keep the gear loops closer to the front so I often end up with a long tail as well. After cinching tight~ I just wrap it around the waist loop a few times to take up the slack. If you use those little keeper loops I find the tail gets in the way of gear being clipped. If you really want to cut it shorter~ sew folds in the end the way it is now.,Dec 2010,Mar 11 2020,3

4931,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,14, Everyone here is freaking out over nothing. Cut it~ throw an overhand in it~ and move on. Better yet~ just (*gasp*) stitch it the same way it is now~ sewing isn't hard and if you use a good thick nylon thread and roughly the same stitching pattern/quantity you see on there~ it'll be perfect. Harnesses don't fail because the webbing loosens in a fall anyway~ unless you have a harness that needs to be doubled back and you didn't do it.,Sep 2019,Mar 11 2020,9

4933,Cutting Webbing on Harness,1,16, Harnesses were designed to have the waistbelt slip to reduce the impact of a fall. That's why you have to tighten your harness after every fall... I dont see a problem shortening it~ as I have done to my DMM Renegade. Just don't cut too much off and singe the end.,Mar 2018,Mar 11 2020,1

4961,De-stinkification - Anyone tried Rockin Green detergent?,1,2, Wash as usual~ put out to dry in the sun on a clothesline. Spritz with cheap vodka~ let out to dry again.

4962,De-stinkification - Anyone tried Rockin Green detergent?,1,3, My wife uses it for her yoga clothes. It works a little but it the smell will still return. I ditched all my capilene for white cotton T's. 5 for $10. Comfy and soft. I just bring a second one to change into after the hike in. I bring a outlayer and/or down jacket that is synthetic that I wear my cotton T under if I need too. Obviously~ this is for summer time and warm weather. I dont do any winter stuff but if it is colder like I still hike in a cotton T but then switch to a long sleeve synthetic when i get to the base.,Aug 2003,Jun 8 2020,1

4966,De-stinkification - Anyone tried Rockin Green detergent?,1,7, Synthetic fabrics can really hold on to some funk. I haven’t so much had this problem with things that I wear climbing so much as the stuff that I’d wear around the barn and horseback riding on summer days. I never knew I stunk so bad until I took my clothes out of the wash. To get the odor out I’ve used oxi clean odor blaster detergent and hang dry in the sun. You might also consider using washing machine cleaner tabs from affresh or oxi clean or another brand if it’s compatible with your washer prior to washing your clothes. Washers get pretty gunky and can harbor odor causing bacteria after a while~ especially if you’ve been continuously washing soiled smelly clothing in it without cleaning it.,Feb 2020,Jun 8 2020,1
4967,De-stinkification - Anyone tried Rockin Green detergent?,1,8, Old capilene 2 quarter zip long sleeve shirts. No silver chloride~ unfortunately.

I'll burn after an hour in high summer sun unless I'm covered by cloth or slathered in sunscreen. Cool. From the testing I've been doing~ the antimicrobial treatment in the new stuff seems to work marginally well when compared to fabrics that don't have any~ but I don't know if it'll keep for months/years. My thought is the treatment is bound to wash out after time. I guess one of the ideas is you can wash them less~ which wears them out less (and saves water)~ so the garment lasts longer. I've been geeking out on this stuff~ lately - just thought I'd share some of the info I've learned. Full reviews coming soon ;)   ,Jan 2014,Jun 9 2020,1

4969,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),1,0, Hey y'all~ Been having some trouble finding a suitable trad multi-pitch shoe that's sensitive (like Solution's)~ but comfortable with socks. I have a wide forefoot with high arches. Looking for a shoe that's sensitive enough for granite friction slab~ but has enough structure to endure multiple pitches of offwidths. I've used Miura Lace Ups (too narrow in the forefoot)~ Katakis (great barefoot~ but doesn't size up well for socks)~ Alturas (not sensitive enough)~ and have tried on TC Pros (kills my Achilles tendon). I'm not sure what models to look at besides the ones I've mentioned - appreciate any helpful relevant suggestions! Thanks~ Natalie,Feb 2016,Jun 6 2020,0

4975,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),1,6," Sounds like the shape of my feet. I have most luck with the Scarpa brand.

4976,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),1,7, The new Scarpa Vapor lace model is stiff~ great at edging and super cozy for me and my short~ wide feet with high arches. Mine are not sized loose enough to wear with socks~ but I imagine they would be fine sized up a bit. Sized down they do put pressure on the Achilles’ tendon which helps with overall foot stability.

4978,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),1,9, Maverinks are perfect for granite friction slab but I can't attest to their ability to offwidth. My girlfriend is so happy I got them for her. They're children's equivalent to the geniuses~ but without a stiff midsole~ making friction slab easier than with other shoes.

4983,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),1,14, I have the new Vapor laces~ and i think there a very nice comfort shoe while maintaining performance~ compared to the old model i find the newer one softer. This could be due to the hole in the bottom of the rubber. Really like the toe rubber as it allows you to jam without destroying the fabric. Im wearing one size down form my street size but have also worn 2 sizes down. Heel system seems to be mostly the same although I never found any problems with pain in my heels. the shoe basically fits amazingly as every time I put them on its a almost perfect seal which feels like the shoe is hugging you food.

And the sizesquirrel rec - didn't know about that site and the search by foot shape is helpful. I think I might start out with trying on the new Vapor Laces since a few people mentioned that one and go from there through the suggestions. I've actually used/tried a number of other models~ but didn't think to mention them in the OP - mythos (not low profile enough to jam in cracks <#0.75)~ maverinks (heel cup too big)~ katana velcro (love~ but discontinued afaik).

4998,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),2,8, I've just been wearing the Solutions size up to be comfy and I like it so far.

4999,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),2,9, You need multiple pairs of shoes if it matters and you have a way to carry them~ otherwise there's always a sacrifice.  You might try on the Evolve General - cut a lot lower around the Achilles than a TC Pro~ wider forefoot than anything Sportiva~ downturn is closer to a Solution than a TC Pro.  It's still an insensitive clodhopper crack shoe~ though~ just like all other others.,Jun 2020,Jun 8 2020,1

5001,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),2,11, I have wide(ish) feet and high arches~ as well. I recently had to ditch the five ten pinks (my previously favorite shoe) after five ten decided to slim-down the toebox. I switched over to both the Grandstones and the Up Moccs from Unparallel. The grandestones are great and a bit more aggressive than the TCs or pinks while still being comfortable enough for longer days. Downside of the GS is the toebox tapers to a much sharper point (think Quantums) than the TCs~ so jamming is a bit more painful for me (slight morton's toe).  The Up Moccs have become my new favorite all-around shoes--super sensitive~ comfy~ and stickier than any other shoes i've used. They're basically Moccasyms~ but upgraded in nearly every way.  The heel is better than any other slipper I've used. They stretched less than Moccs due to the rubber toe pad that also helps minimize pain in cracks.  The only slippers I can imagine liking more than these would be updated Supermoccs..... (Hope you're listening~ UP),Apr 2015,Jun 8 2020,0

5003,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),2,13, Liking the Maestro mid~ precise~ jams cracks~ small edges great.....bit more active randing so standing on lower-aangle slabs definitely ends up with pressure on the heel and toe box...but great shape~ durable.....maybe 60 pitches in them and finally primo fit......liking them!,Sep 2009,Jun 8 2020,1
5004,Trad multi-pitch shoe recommendations - wide forefoot~ high arches (not TC Pros),2,14, Ditto on the quantum lace.

5038,Storing Gear on Glacier for Guiding,1,0, Hey Everyone~ I am working as a glacier guide in AK and we are trying to figure out a way to store ropes and other heavy equipment a few miles back on the glacier in order to help save our guides legs over the course of a season. Though this area does not get much traffic from other guide services or climbers~ we are trying to figure out a)how to keep our gear somewhat secure and b)how to let our ropes dry.  Does anyone have any experience doing this? Would love to hear other problems with this idea as well as how it can be managed. Thanks!,Mar 2015,Jun 7 2020,0

5041,Storing Gear on Glacier for Guiding,1,3, Let your clients do  the leg work ;) Not sure about AK but in Europe it's fairly common practice to let the clients do some of the heavy lifting on the approach. Otherwise~ get a big dry box with a dehumidifier? Just brain storming. Not sure if this would work on the ACTUAL glacier or that you would have to place them on the moraine fields. The latter would also help with drying the gear and rope. ,Feb 2020,Jun 8 2020,0

5052,Auto-blocking Munter,1,1, They can be super handy in the right situation. But I would not use it as a belay. it's not just hard to lower a climber on it~  it's bloody impossible!

5056,Auto-blocking Munter,1,5, There's more friction than just a munter hitch. It also requires two carabiners.  There's a different version of the autoblocking munter that adds minimal friction~ but takes a little more time to engage. The advantages of the munter for me are the speed of setup and the ability to lower extremely simply. An autoblocking mode eliminates those things~ so I have little reason to use it. ,Jun 2015,Jun 7 2020,4

5070,Otaki vs Katana Lace in terms of stiffness and sensitivity,1,0, Currently I am wearing the Otaki for singe pitch climbs. They are pretty stiff~ and unless I am needing micro edging power they can be overkill~ and the stiffness decreases the sensitivity a lot which makes them scary for techy routes. For anyone who has worn both the Otaki and the Katana lace how do they compare in terms of stiffness~ sensitivity~ and sizing?,Apr 2017,May 23 2020,0
5071,Otaki vs Katana Lace in terms of stiffness and sensitivity,1,1," What kind of tech? from my experience with both of the shoes~ I'd say the Otaki is very stiff under the ball of your foot~ but the break through the midsole certainly softens the shoe longitudinally for more heel-hooky~ scummy~ 3d tech climbing. Katana Lace is stiff throughout. Toe bump is really nice~ high asymmetry was great. I'd imagine it'd be a killer steep face-climbing shoe for like~ The Fins or Ten Sleep or something. But just didn't feel right for most of the climbing I do in WA. But that might just be me. The Katana Lace is in my opinion the most amazing shoes in the LS line. I wear a comfy-sized 42.5~ and the shoe seems to do really well on just about anything. ramble up multis~ sink into jams~ edge on techy faces~ handles its own on steeps. In my opinion~ it's the shoe that performs just about anywhere at 90%. Rock a 42 or 41.5 in more aggressive~ specialized shoes.  I bought it to be a comfy all-day shoe for multipitch jaunts~ and now it's the shoe I use for everything but super-steep -- and even then~  I'll project in the Katana before breaking out the testarossa for the ""redpoint burns"" (... I'm a mediocre climber no doubt~ but I spent a lot of time trying out shoes (thank god for the used gear market~ right?). If I were to only have one shoe for the rest of my days~ it'd be the Katana Lace.",Jun 2019,May 26 2020,5
5072,Otaki vs Katana Lace in terms of stiffness and sensitivity,1,2, I can only speak for Katana Lace since I don't own Otaki.  Other than TC Pros~ I typically wear Katana Laces on most days. I also really love Kataki (I actually prefer Kataki for longer crack climbs - esp. thin cracks!) I believe Kataki is supposed to be stiffer than Katana~ but I find that they feel a bit softer. I think these are worth mentioning to try out. I always size for comfort - I wear 38.5 TC Pros~  38.5/39 Katana Laces~ and 38.5 Kataki.,Oct 2017,May 26 2020,0
5073,Otaki vs Katana Lace in terms of stiffness and sensitivity,1,3, Thanks for the info guys. I ended up getting the Katana Lace and have climbed about 12 pitches in them. Best all around shoe that I have used. Edge as good or better than the Otaki and are much more sensitive. They are really comfortable in cracks too for the amount of down turn they have.  ,Apr 2017,Jun 6 2020,2
5074,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,0, Essentially my question is how to stay efficient when the leader has run out of gear and the follower reaches the belay station. What I found is the majority of time lost is in the former leader having to coil their half of the rope up at the belay. Is it common to keep your roles of leader and follower for the whole climb to avoid this? or does one person just climb with the rope coiled around them the entire time whether leading or following?  Sharing any tips from your experience with anything regarding simul-climbing would be appreciated!,Sep 2015,Jun 6 2020,0
5075,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,1, Both people can share the rope carrying duty. Climbing with 30m on you can be tough~ but 15m isn't so bad even if you're leading. It's much faster to change roles at the belay unless the follower racked all the gear on a sling that can quickly passed off. ,Jun 2015,Jun 6 2020,2
5076,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,2, Both people can share the rope carrying duty. Climbing with 30m on you can be tough~ but 15m isn't so bad even if you're leading. It's much faster to change roles at the belay unless the follower racked all the gear on a sling that can quickly passed off.  So your saying 15m can be coiled on both climbers? I didnt think of that! Climbing with 30/35m of coiled rope gets pretty tiring on a long stretch of climbing.,Sep 2015,Jun 6 2020,2
5077,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,3, or just fold a rope in half and use double rope technique (has to be rated for this~ but many skinny ropes are). I'd recommend a half rope~ personally. The rope weighs less~ easier to deal w rope drag~ and no coiling. same rap-able length. ,Feb 2017,Jun 6 2020,3

5079,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,5, If you're walking off~ you can use a gym rope.  35-40m is my ideal distance.  ,Jun 2012,Jun 6 2020,1
5080,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,6, So your saying 15m can be coiled on both climbers? I didnt think of that! Climbing with 30/35m of coiled rope gets pretty tiring on a long stretch of climbing. Having ~10m coiled on each climber is my normal when climbing with a ~60m rope.,Apr 2006,Jun 6 2020,1
5081,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,7, Stuffing the rope in a backpack can be nicer to climb with than the coils. The most efficient way can be to pass the backpack and switch tie ins in many instances. Lots of factors to think about~ whether or not you're using microtraxions~ after cruxes or spaced out evenly~ and if you're going to have the stronger climber be the follower or the leader~ length of climb~ how far you're running it out in between peices~ if you're going to need to switch to a traditional belay for the cruxes~ and what type of descent. These things are going to determine what rope length and how much you have coiled~ as well as the rest of your strategy.  For example on 5.easy with a great partner and  walk off descent I might use a 20m rope~ no coils and 1 or no micros.  On vertical harder terrain with a single rope rappel descent~ I commonoly use a 60m or 70m with half packed in a backpack and a micro placed every 100 feet. In this scenario I might have the stronger climber lead since it will increase the speed and the risk of the follower pulling off the leader is mitigated. ,Sep 2013,Jun 6 2020,1
5082,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,8, I like the second having a grigri to easily adjust length of rope out and easy switch to a regular belay and back so double ropes are out for me For full on simul climb I like a short rope. For occasional simul and regular belay I like a backpack to flake into.  ​,Oct 2011,Jun 6 2020,1

5084,Simul Climbing Question - Efficency at Belay Stations,1,10, Have definitely thought about splitting the rope in half~ but instances where you are using a fatter rope is mostly what I’m wondering about. The backpack method makes sense if you aren’t planning on needing to give additional slack. For that reason using a coil has always been more attractive to me. Although yesterday I got really tired simuling 4 steep pitches with all that rope coiled around me and figured there must be a better way!,Sep 2015,Jun 6 2020,0

5097,La Sportiva TXS GTX? Anyone tried them?,1,6, Not the TXS~ but I've been wearing the TX Guides lately~ I've climbed mid 5.10 choss and gone for a 10-mile run in them~ I'm pretty happy and plan for them to basically my everything shoe. They are narrower than I expected~ even for La Sportiva. I appreciate the lugged soles for hiking~ and the stiff sole for climbing - they certainly climb better than the TX5s. The soles remind me more of the 5.10 guide tennies stiffness~ though it has been a while since I've worn those. They're somewhat water resistant~ maybe good for stepping in a puddle - I poured water on them and got a solid 3 count before I felt wet~ but I haven't really beaten them up yet~ I think they'll be less water resistant soon.  I'm in a mining camp right now (well~ quarantining for 2 weeks before we can go in)~ then my every day shoes will either be the Trango Tech Leather GTX or the TX Guides~ so I'll be able to give a decent review on either later.  All of the TX series seem less like they can take a beating than I would like. Dear La Sportiva - give us shoe laces that will take a beating~ or that will last longer.

I have the TX2s in 43.5 TX3 in 42.5 TX4 in 43 (with boot board/stiffener added below the footbed and these shoes all fit similarly (except the 4s without the boot board would be a little sloppy).

5119,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,0, Does anyone use the UD Fastpack 25 as an daypack for alpine climbing? It has everything I want from a daypack~ but I’m finding it’s not very comfortable when loaded with gear (small rack~ crampons~ tools~ puffy~ few other miscellaneous l things). Anyone have experience with it that can speak to long term use/comfort for that type of activity?,Aug 2016,Apr 24 2020,0
5120,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,1, I’ve used a BD Distance 15 which is a similar style vest pack. I don’t find it comfortable or practical with a full rack of gear. Carrying a rope with it sucks too. The best thing I have used it for is solo alpine climbing and carrying on the approach to take on route. I find the vest style packs to have more freedom of movement compared to traditional packs. Once manufactures catch on~ I think vest packs will be a lot more popular for climbing. ,Oct 2017,Apr 24 2020,0
5121,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,2, The UD SCRAM is probably a better choice for alpine climbing type activities.  I have one and have been really happy with it~ and it's specifically designed for a broader range of activities than just fastpacking.,Mar 2015,Apr 24 2020,0
5122,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,3, I have the Fastpack 25~ I bought it used at some point for $30 ... glad I didn't pay more~ I have the same feelings: It rides way too high and doesn't carry weight comfortably. I also have an 18L UD skimo race pack and I have been similarly unimpressed with the fit and the way it carries weight. Two packs into UD (both used) and I wouldn't purchase another.,Oct 2016,Apr 24 2020,0

5125,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,6, Is the SCRAM that much more comfortable? I really like the FP25 because of the big exterior pockets (great for wet crampons or a belay jacket between pitches). I can add my own ski loop and hook for skimo stuff.,Aug 2016,Apr 24 2020,0
5126,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,7, Maybe go for the ALL MOUNTAIN~ as it can actually carry a rope/rack. The SCRAM is tiny~ and what I use for a pair of approach shoes and a chalk bag. (Here's a review). The ALL MOUNTAIN would have the capacity of a Fast Pack ~30~ but have that capacity in the main compartment~ without any pockets on the exterior. Those mesh external pockets do get beat up in an alpine setting. Fastpacks are not really made to handle heavy loads~ but rather be a pack that's somewhat runnable in that has enough for some overnight gear (potentially). No matter what pack you get from UD~ if you don't like not having an honest to goodness iliac-crest-sitting hip belt~ you're not going to want to use anything from UD. Getting things dialed is also really key. I use the Fastpack line for things like very long (like days) ridge traverses (like this) and well: fastpacks where I'm peak bagging all over the place (like this).,Jan 2014,Apr 24 2020,0

5129,Ultimate Direction Fastpack 25,5,10, I've never used an FP so take this for what it's worth~ but... the pic on the UD website looks like the FP shoulder straps attach higher on the pack than on the SCRAM (i.e. more like a running vest and less like a backpack). The SCRAM straps attach low on the pack and I'd think that would allow the waist belt to be more effective when needed. I'd be fine with the SCRAM if I was carrying a light rack~ crampons~ tools~ extra layer and water - if I had a rope / much more on top of that I'd probably use something else. For me the SCRAM is more comfortable than the BD Blitz 20~ which is my other comparable pack.,Mar 2016,Apr 24 2020,0

5136,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,0, We have a bunch of places to TR that do not have sport bolts going up to the anchors. The anchors aren't in the greatest of places to just lean over and set so it's way safer to rap in and set them. Would there be a benefit to snagging a cheap(er) rope to accomplish this? If so~ does anyone have some suggestions?  My thought was grabbing a rope when it goes on sale and cutting it? i assumed it would get damaged a little more dragging over the edges~ dirt~ ect? maybe that's a non issue~ but figured i'd throw it out and see what people think. Thanks!,Apr 2020,Jun 3 2020,0

5138,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,2," Use your climbing rope. Rap to the bolts~ hang anchor~ pull rope from rappel and move it to your anchor. Rap down from there. This~ and/or buy yourself a nice length of STATIC rope in an odd length. Use that as your safety rope at the top of the place you described AND you can use it to set TR anchors in a safe and effective way in situations where anchors are WAY back from the edge~ too. Google ""Joshua Tree Toprope System"" if you need further explanation of that. ",Jan 2016,Jun 3 2020,3
5139,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,3," Pulling a rap rope can be hard on trees at the top.  If those are your anchors it may be better to scramble back up after setting the top rope and walk off. Señor's advice of some static rope is a good one. You won't need as much static line if you don't have to rap all the way to the ground. One can use a fixed line method with prusik to approach the anchor and return safely. As the bottom of the fixed line is not likely ""fixed"" in this situation you need a catastrophe knot below the prusik so you cannot prusik off the end of the rope. I use a 40' chunk of thin Bluewater Static rope that takes up little space or weight in my pack. Useful for all kinds of things.",Dec 2019,Jun 3 2020,2
5140,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,4, Seconding this - also the friction from the tree bark can be more than enough to have your rope be hopelessly stuck.

5141,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,5, Static rope is the way to go for this application.  You can find new lines of various length through all of the on-line retailers~ but I recommend Rock n' Rescue  While your at it~ get yourself a couple of locking STEEL carabiners for the TR.

5144,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,8, You could: (1) Rappel on your climbing rope to the bolts~ build an anchor on the bolts~ pull your rope~ hang it from your new anchor~ and continue rappelling. (2) Tie a short length of static rope to a tree~ rappel on the static rope to the bolts~ build an anchor~ hang your climbing rope from your new anchor~ transfer from the static rope to the climbing rope and continue rappelling (your static rope is still set up for when you want to retrieve your anchor at the end of the session). (3) Ignore the bolts and build your own anchor from the top of the cliff. Anything I missed? All of these would be good options depending on the situation and your mood.,Apr 2015,Jun 4 2020,1
5145,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,9, What do you mean jug back to the top? Sorry for the dumb question. I think this is actually what I'm aiming for. A rope to get me to the anchor. A separate to tr off of. When we're done with that route~ I'd like to be able to get on the original rap rope and move the anchor to another route.  If you're worried about pulling the rope around the tree~ throw a sling around it as in intermediate anchor.

5147,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,11,  I'm the first person to suggest a 2nd static rope. My suggestion is based on the idea that you're not just talking about this ONE climb. Obviously~ if there's a bolted anchor get yourself to it and use it. So in that case the static line would just be as your safety rope to protect you as you rap down to the anchors. My other point was that at places without bolted anchors it's great to have a nice long piece of static line to rig an anchor system with a masterpoint that is over the edge. You never want to TR off an anchor set back behind an edge if you can avoid it. That's the recipe for drag and rope wear. ,Jan 2016,Jun 4 2020,0

5154,Rope suggestions for setting TRs when rappeling is required,1,18, Jake~ sounds like you are new to setting up anchors. While everyone has provided valid technical advice~ I recommend finding someone who knows what they’re doing to help you through the process at least for the first couple of times. If you don’t have anyone to show you~ practicing anchor building/transitions on the ground or steep hill using some trees would be helpful before dangling yourself off a cliff.,Apr 2017,Jun 5 2020,2

I don't and I can readily tell the difference: according to Sportiva Kataki/Otaki have PD75 last (also Muira/Skwama/Futura) vs PD55 for Katana/Lace (also TC Pro)~ so they are more asymmetric (normally fit someone better w/ straight & longer big toes). This says nothing about the downturn or the toe box width/volume/stretch or whatever other fit issue.,Jul 2006,Dec 4 2019,0

This says nothing about the downturn or the toe box width/volume/stretch or whatever other fit issue. It is possible. It isn't very pronounced~ close to length of my big toe. I've gone through at least 15 pairs of Katana Lace over the years and about 5 pairs of Katakis since they've been released. I know it's anecdotal~ but the front end always felt the same to me~ especially after break-in. The noticeable differences to me: the increased rigidity and support of the Katana (full length sole/midsole)~ and the flexibility / heel hooking ability of the Kataki (3/4 sole + S-Heel). Kataki was definitely a better utility shoe that did almost everything well~ but I still prefer Katana Lace for thin cracks~ techy long vert pitches~ and boulders with micro edges. You're right about the PD55 vs PD75 lasts~ but I never felt the difference in practice~ especially after break-in. ,Jul 2010,Dec 4 2019,0

Even though this wasn't directed at me~ I would like to answer.  I've worn both the Katana Lace and the Kataki extensively (I own at least 6 pairs of Kataki~ had a few KL).  An advantage of both is their stiff toe and precision.  This is amazing in a variety of climbing situations~ from high-level trad~ to hard bouldering and hard sport climbing.  However~ this stiffness is also the Katana Lace's main disadvantage.   You can't (or at least I can't) heel hook securely on the Katana Lace.  It's so stiff that it feels like its being levered off your heel whenever it makes contact with even a good hold.  For me~ this is the main disadvantage.  Without this~ the katana lace is a truely outstanding all-rounder shoe.  But you can't have an all-rounder shoe that is incapable of heel hooking.  This is a critical weakness in bouldering~ but also matters in sport and hard trad (think arete climbs or steep sport).  If you don't believe in heel-hooking on trad climbs~ I recommend you look at photos of the face climbing on El Cap.  ,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,4
5193,LaSportive Kataki discontinued.,2,17, The trad dads who buy the Katana Lace don't understand why heels are important~ so the Kataki didn't sell well I don't have any in on the real reason~ other than one of Rock & Resole employee told me while Kataki sold well in the states~ it didn't in Europe as they don't climb that much trad.,Jul 2006,Jun 3 2020,0

But if the Kataki is discontinued in the states and continued in Europe~ why would it have sold well in the states?  I don't have an in either~ but I have heard from industry folks that the Katana Lace basically just continued taking up a big share of the market and the kataki never caught on here.  ,May 2020,Jun 4 2020,0

5199,Tendon Canyon Dry 9.0,1,1, As a absolute last resort but certainly not recommended. It’s a thin dynamic rope and use as a top rope anchor with lots of stretch is sketchy at best and could at worst stretch enough for ground fall depending on the rope you’re climbing on~ route and how close to the ground your climber is. Go to the Portsmouth EMS and have them cut you some static rope to use as a top rope anchor. EDIT - I’ll stand corrected this is a canyoneering rope which is certainly better than it being a dynamic rope. With that said I’ve always used Sterling static rope. And just checked - Sterling static ropes have similar elongation as per the reference post below. You’re good to go!,Feb 2013,Jun 4 2020,0

5212,Wild country nuts,1,0, Hello~ I’m trying to dip my foot in trad climbing~ and I’m wondering if a set of Wild Country nuts (1-14) would be enough to get me to the top of some single pitch trad routes? Also~ how would the larger nuts compare with some smaller cams in terms of the size of crack I can place them in? Thanks!,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,0
5213,Wild country nuts,1,1, If you use a notchless oval biner to clip the set to your wristwatch they should all fit in most fist cracks. Interesting game. Top rope or use a mock lead rope~ see if you would only want one set or more gear generally.,May 2020,Jun 3 2020,0
5214,Wild country nuts,1,2, I would highly recommend picking out some trad climbs you would like to do~ read what the protection recommendations are from guidebooks or MP~ and pick up relevant cam sizes to supplement that great set of nuts. Picking up some slings and carabiners to create alpine draws are an important asset as well. Have fun! Don't rush the learning process :),Nov 2018,Jun 3 2020,2
5215,Wild country nuts,1,3, Yes~ no~ and somewhat. Depending on the route passive gets you to the top just fine~ or run out but acceptable~ or not at all.,Mar 2018,Jun 3 2020,2
5216,Wild country nuts,1,4, I have three or four sets of nuts...I usually grab my BD Stoppers and DMM Offsets. Habit.   Nothing wrong with the WC Rocks~ they are perfectly good. ,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,1
5217,Wild country nuts,1,5," As mentioned maybe it would get you up. Is it a climb well below your limit (e.g. 5.2) and you don't mind running out sections that need big pro? Is it a climb that the topo recommends only pro up to 1"". A better bet also as mentioned is to mock lead on top rope. Then run outs won't matter. Do you have someone to check how well and where you made your placements? Kind of a requirement to learn to trad climb.",Oct 2011,Jun 3 2020,1

5219,Wild country nuts,1,7," TBH~ if you're wanting to ""dip your toe"" in trad climbing~ you're way better off finding someone who already trad climbs and going with them.   Not the least of the reasons is that most folks already have their own rack.  I'm super easy going~ so I usually end up using my partner's rack because even through I have plenty of nice stuff (totems and metolious UL and a pink tricam~ etc) my partners feel more comfortable on their rack and I personally don't care. The other reason is that it's much nicer to follow someone and pull placements that they have made as a way to figure out what good placements might look like.",Nov 2018,Jun 3 2020,4

5221,Wild country nuts,1,9, All you need are two big ones. ,Oct 2010,Jun 3 2020,2
5222,Wild country nuts,1,10, Nuts will do just fine as long as you find a partner with cams and no nuts. I like WC Rocks~ use them all the time~ but there are very few climbs I would do with just nuts. And if I did~ I'd want two sets of nuts. Hexes are a good idea~ and lowe tri-cams are also pretty good passive pro that I think get bigger than most nuts. Mock lead and mentor are also good suggestions. ,Nov 2012,Jun 3 2020,0
5223,Wild country nuts,1,11, I think beginners to gear climbs should sew up climbs and stay on climbs at least a couple of grades below their top rope abilities. I find that a full set of passive pro is a great way to cheaply have plenty of gear for easy climbs (can depend on the geology where you climb~ you can be pretty limited in Canyonlands type rock where parallel cracks are everywhere). A full set of stoppers~ rocks~or offsets and all the hexes that carry on in size above that. Then you can start leading and later collect the type of cams you like based on experience with other leaders racks. Even when I have double of cams I still bring nuts and a few Tricams. If I know I will be doing an off width I add the largest couple of hexes too.,Dec 2019,Jun 4 2020,0
5224,Valdotain tresse~ non-climbing uses of.,1,0, This post is about a non-climbing application of climbing gear~ as well as a chance for me to express my appreciation of the valdotain tresse friction hitch.  Below is the leash I use for my dog~ Frodo. He pulls like a truck and will not change (bulldogs are notoriously difficult to train~ and that ship sailed before I got him). An umbilical-type leash is really the only solution~ but I sometimes want it short and sometimes want it long.  Enter the valdotain tresse. The 3mm valdotain tresse on 8mm accessory cord is effortless to adjust in either direction~ even under a full dog-load. It will hold 175 lbs if needed (I hung on it from an anchor to see). The leash has a small loop at either end and a butterfly in the middle - I tied the ends of the friction hitch together to fix it permanently to the butterfly loop rather than use the typical strand-with-two-eyes configuration. Nylon-on-nylon~ and everybody is going to die. This leash setup is perfect for my needs and~ I dare say~ the needs of any other dog owner. Fight me if you disagree.

5229,Valdotain tresse~ non-climbing uses of.,1,5, My first iteration consisted of two purcell prusik hitches facing one another - one went around the waist and one went to the collar. Since the one around the waist never needs to actually be adjusted~ that was a waste of cord. The 2:1 adjustment on the dog end didn't allow for very much extension~ and in order to shorten it I would have to batman towards the lunging dog to get to the hitch - not ideal. This is a 1:1 gain on extension and the hitch stays within reach.  Or would you envision using the Blake's hitch differently than a single-stranded-purcell-type arrangement?,Aug 2004,Jun 3 2020,0
5230,Valdotain tresse~ non-climbing uses of.,1,6, You could always tie a blake's with the tail of the bight going around your waist instead of the cord.  I like this setup though.,Jul 2014,Jun 4 2020,0

5269,Lockbox for gear,1,14, I also know someone who put a metal bar lengthwise across their trunk area and used it to rack/organize gear.  The area where the spare goes was where he kept ropes~ shoes and harness etc...  It wasn’t locked up~ just covered~ out of sight.  It was a very effective way to store gear on the road ,Nov 2012,Jun 3 2020,0
5270,Protecting run-outs,1,0, Hello all! I am curious as to what is other people's opinions on what gear to use protecting run-outs on sport climbing routes? I am usually willing to be pretty bold~ but some routes I get quite nervous on being far away from the nearest bolt. I don't neccersarily have a ton of interest into getting into dedicated trad climbing quite yet in my career~ as I enjoy simple single pitch sport climbing~ top-roping~ and bouldering mainly. My thoughts are: - Cams are your sorta do all - need all~ yes but are pretty spendy (college budget). - Nuts / hexes are a bit cheaper but are probably more limited in application? Maybe? Once again not much of a trad climber. - Manning up a bit is free~ but also being safe is smarter? I'd rather spend a tad bit of cash for the ease of mind. Thanks all!! ** Bonus points for recommendations for length of static rope to develop some boulders!! (I'm thinking 30-40' but I may be dead wrong),Sep 2019,Jun 2 2020,0
5271,Protecting run-outs,1,1, Your best bet is to talk to experienced folks who climb where you climb. ,Aug 2007,Jun 2 2020,4
5272,Protecting run-outs,1,2," If it takes gear~ it's really not much of a sport climb.   Maybe just don't climb trad climbs until you are at the point ""in your career"" where you want to learn how to place gear.  There's more to placing gear than owning gear.   Maybe either only climb run out stuff you feel confident on or climb harder stuff with confidence-inspiring protection? Or buy a single set of cams~ some nuts~ and some alpine draws~ and start doing trad climbs.  That's my general recommendation.",Nov 2018,Jun 2 2020,8
5273,Protecting run-outs,1,3, For your needs~ I think a stick clip is your best bet. Not all sport run outs will be gear protectable. If the run out doesn't feel safe~ go in direct to a bolt and stick clip the next one. If you care about leading the route clean~ place an extra really long draw on the bolt above the run out to give you a clip in the middle of the gap.,May 2015,Jun 2 2020,31
5274,Protecting run-outs,1,4, This is all relative to specific routes.  Cams and nuts don't work on blank slabs or overhanging caves without constrictions or pockets in the rock.  Since you're talking runout~ I'm assuming this climbing is somewhat slabby.   My advice - talk to some local climbers.  Chances are they either don't consider what you're talking about runout or there is climb specific gear that will help facilitate run outs between bolts. Small/med nuts aren't a bad starting point but learn how to use them from someone who knows. Regarding the boulders~ 30-40 should be plenty. Clean on rappel or learn to TR solo for highball projects.,Mar 2020,Jun 2 2020,1
5275,Protecting run-outs,1,5, If you need “gear” you’re not sport climbing. ,Mar 2008,Jun 2 2020,11
5276,Protecting run-outs,1,6, This is likely the best answer and it can help save ankles for clipping the first (and sometimes second) bolt.  ,Jun 2016,Jun 2 2020,6
5277,Protecting run-outs,1,7, This should prove to yourself that you don't know how to properly set gear. So~ find a mentor/more experienced trad climbing partner and follow and clean him/her up a dozen pitches to learn and observe how and see how gear is placed. Try placing gear on TR with two ropes and try falling on gear to boost your morale with the TR as a backup if you need too. It's a good learning tool. ,Sep 2014,Jun 2 2020,2
5278,Protecting run-outs,1,8, Please don't take this as sarcasm but clearly 'the appropriate protection' is the obvious answer.  Some routes will take a bomber nut~ some a bomber cam~ some a hex etc.  Place whatever gear is going to offer the best protection in that particular situation. BTW~ there's no point at all in protecting a sports route with gear if you don't know how to place gear :-),Dec 2017,Jun 2 2020,1
5279,Protecting run-outs,1,9, Try Fraiding.  Free+Aid+Afraid Use a stick clip to snag the rope up to the next hanger while you are in direct off on your highest bolt. Batman up or use the toprope effect to get past the scary part. If you are dead set on leading but the gap is too scary~ use festooing. That's where you use long ass runners to extend clips down from your destination bolt to serve as a kind of intermittent clip.,Nov 2019,Jun 3 2020,3
5280,Protecting run-outs,1,10, If a sport route is runout~ don't lead it unless you're solid at the grade. Unless it was retrobolted~ there probably aren't any meaningful gear placements anyway.,Sep 2018,Jun 3 2020,2
5281,Protecting run-outs,1,11, Since everyone hates Linkcams you might be able to get them used cheaply~ and as two or three cover a very wide range~ they may solve your problem as emergency runout pieces. Plus~ since you’re new~ you’ll probably get them stuck fairly soon~ at which point you’ll be ready to invest in proper gear. ,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,1
5282,Protecting run-outs,1,12, Lol~ just because its bolted doesn't not mean that it's a sport route. Check out Matrix at Roger's slide. Fully bolted~ absolutely not a sport route.,Mar 2017,Jun 3 2020,0
5283,Protecting run-outs,1,13, It's very route intensive~ every climb/rock face is different. Also~ sometimes outside routes aren't bolted every 5 feet. ,Jan 2019,Jun 3 2020,1
5284,Protecting run-outs,1,14, What are considering a runout? No gear or bolt for how far? Fi Fi hooks? But still it depends on the route. Like the route Run For Your Life out in J Tree. Everyone thinks that is runout. But the falls are safe even so. So it is not even a PG rating. Runouts are not that bad if they don't have the PG or R rating. So to speak. Don't quote me on that. Because everything you climb is on you. Yeah I like what he said above. Climb on something in your on-sight abilities. If they are too run out. Or be bold and do them anyway. Your call. ,Jun 2017,Jun 3 2020,0
5285,Protecting run-outs,1,15, IMO your best option is actually tricams~ specifically the smaller sizes black pink and red.  Here’s why: 1) Super cheap (you could get the full set for easily under $100 and probably closer to $50 if you watch the sales) 2) Lightweight (you won’t notice them on your harness and so can bring them up every time) 3) Most likely to find placements on sport routes.  Since most sport routes don’t necessarily follow a crack~ cams are debatably useful; however~ you almost certainly will find a tiny pod~ pocket; etc that will eat up a tricam.  This goes especially for limestone. 4) Easy to place once you practice it.  Tricams get a bad rep for being hard to place mainly because most trad climbers don’t use them very often~ but once you learn how they work they’re actually quite easy to place and aren’t as susceptible to lifting out with upward pull as nuts or walking like cams. No one’s going to lug even a single rack of cams or set of nuts with them every time~ but you won’t even notice a set of tricams on your harness until you need them.,Jul 2014,Jun 3 2020,5
5286,Protecting run-outs,1,16," As much as I hate Tricams~ rock in the Black Hills granite takes Tricams very well~ at least for the leader~ they suck to clean. I am not familiar with the limestone of Spearfish~ so this only goes for the Needles and Mt. Rushmore. Small camming units also seem to be especially useful in BH granite~ but if a climb is bolted~ there probably won't be a crack available to use. Four Little Fishies is a ""Sport"" route in name only (Four Little Fishies  in 130 feet of climbing) For instance~ Gericrawl in the Outlets area on Old Peoples Dome~ has a terrible runout that will put you near the ground if you blow it. Protects with a finger sized cam/nut~ and then a larger cam at the horizontal break 30 feet higher.",Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,0
5287,Protecting run-outs,1,17, I was going to tell you that most sport routes are safe~ even if they seem runout to a newer climber. However~ I see you climb in the Black Hills. God help you.,Apr 2013,Jun 3 2020,2
5288,Protecting run-outs,1,18, I’m always amazed when people don’t know the definition of “sport climbing” vs “climbing”..... I guess this is one of those times. Herb Conn- a distant relative of mine- once said something along the line of “If you’re strong~ you can climb every inch of the Black Hills”  I’ve never climbed their but if it’s anything like other old time spots- YV~ Boulder~ TM etc do not expect bolts to be littered all over the climbs. Those old dads were poor~ lazy and had to hand drill~ add to that the fact that a person’s manhood would be called out if even one extra bolt was placed Stick to modern “sport climbing” if you’re looking for well protected climbs~ not some face climb done in 1965. ,Mar 2008,Jun 3 2020,1
5289,Protecting run-outs,1,19, How does this help the thread starter?,Jul 2014,Jun 3 2020,0
5290,Protecting run-outs,1,20, this (festooning).  unless it is a mixed route~ gear usually won't help as there likely won't be placements.  if you really want to lead the route in some way~ but don't want to deal with the runouts~ festooning allows you to do this without affecting the route / others' experience.  it is also a good way to headpoint a route by adjusting where the festoon is and making it more runout each time.  you might get some guff for it~ but it will probably be from twenty-somethings who climb 5.8 (or fifty-somethings that climb 5.8).  big deal.  you aren't a pro (and neither are they).,Dec 2004,Jun 3 2020,3

5295,Protecting run-outs,2,4, You've gotten a broad range of advice on the type of gear to use~ so I think you're covered there~ but I also want to make a plug for down climbing.  If you start to feel like you are too far out over your gear and the terrain above feels too tough~ you can always down climb a bit and either get back below your next piece or make your fall more manageable.   It's a useful skill to have~ if you ever start getting into trad.  ,Oct 2010,Jun 3 2020,5

5298,Protecting run-outs,2,7, very good point.,Dec 2004,Jun 3 2020,3
5299,Protecting run-outs,2,8, If yer not much of a trad climber or interested in it and enjoy simple sport climbs then stay off climbs that require trad gear. The way to do that is RTFM.

5300,Dyneema slings,1,0, I've been doing my homework to add some alpine draws to my harness. I never realized until now just how much difference there is between each brand's Dyneema sling. Does anyone have a preference? So far~ I feel like Mammut has the highest quality sling. At only 8mm it is supple and light~ with a super nice fingertrap under the bartack to make it smooth. Both the size and fingertrap should weaken the sling~ but they match other major brands rating at 22Kn. BD 10mm Dynex is not as small and the stitching point has two jagged tips that stick out. I don't love it~ but I did buy ONE of them so I can see if my assumption holds up over time and use. There are a lot of brands out there~ so I'm just curious what everyone else thinks? What's your favorite low-weight alpine sling? (Side note: Does anyone know where I can buy that Dyneema webbing in bulk? I'd love to get a hold of some on a spool for less than $2/foot~ but I can't find anyone who sells it retail.),Apr 2019,Jun 2 2020,0
5301,Dyneema slings,1,1," I like my Camp and Metolius dynema slings. the Metolius ones seem like they will hold up beer than a lot of the thinner slings out there. I have encountered dynema webbing in bulk only while cleaning tat off of a popular rappel. It is branded 'Bull Line""~ googling that found this. https://www.duraline.com/accessories/bull-line-pull-tape/",Sep 2018,Jun 2 2020,1
5302,Dyneema slings,1,2,,Mar 2010,Jun 2 2020,2
5303,Dyneema slings,1,3, I have a lot of the mammut slings. I have also used the bd ones extensively. My 2c is that the mammut ones feel like the 'top of the line' for the reasons you mentioned~ but once the slings are worn-in and become supple~ they all handle and rack pretty much identically. I have not noticed a difference in durability at all. I also just got some of these edelweiss ones. (The relative nature of perception is interesting because now the mammut ones feel downright beefy!) I haven't used them for long and so can't comment on the durability at all~ but they seem well made and don't show any sort of premature wear that makes me feel concerned about their longterm durability.,Mar 2010,Jun 2 2020,2
5304,Dyneema slings,1,4, Bull tape / Mule tape is polyester typically or rarely kevlar. In either case with an extra slick dry or waxy lube coating. Not exactly ideal for climbing use. Regular dyneema webbing like in mammut and BD slings you are unlikely to find available outside of large orders to specialty manufacturers who don't usually sell in small amounts to individuals. It is too slick to knot into slings well~ and knots that hold decrease the strength too much. It must be sewn... and usually that means that only climbing gear manufacturers are buying it. Edelrid Tech Tape is sold by the spool online in a few spots. IIRC because it actually retains a decent amount of strength with knotting. The old Yates site listed something like 14mm Dyneema/nylon blend webbing available by the foot~ but they may not sell it either now. You would have to do your research on if the webbing you eventually find maintains enough strength with knotting for your use and comfort. We have thought about carrying tech web on the spool to sell by the foot~ but pretty much there is no demand. In the sailing world a lot of people make their own slings and such by splicing hollow braid dyneema ropes. Its not technically hard~ but the very easy to separate weave is not really ideal for climbing~ and I obviously can't recommend it.,Aug 2019,Jun 2 2020,1
5305,Dyneema slings,1,5," Like what has been said above~ Mammut Contact slings and DMM 8mm slings are my preference. The are supple from the get go~ and don't take up too much room on your gear loops. They are practically identical~ except for color.  Compared to what we ALL had to use BITD~ tied 1"" webbing~ I feel pretty lucky to have any Dyneema~ but the DMM and Mammut are top of the line IMO. ",Jul 2015,Jun 2 2020,5
5306,Dyneema slings,1,6, I bought some of those 7mm ones when 8mm Mammut were hard to find a while back. Seem to be holding up fine. The only skinny slings I have had bad luck with are Petzl. ,Nov 2017,Jun 2 2020,1
5307,Dyneema slings,1,7, Mammut Contact slings are my preferred though I've see anecdotal claims that some slings don't match the advertised weight. I tend to really like BD dyneema slings as well. I do keep one Bluewater double length sling on multipitch for building anchors (since its 27kN rating). ,Oct 2017,Jun 3 2020,1
5308,Dyneema slings,1,8, A sling is a sling they're all made of dyneema~ they're all basically disposable it's not worth the money buying expensive or lighter slings~ buy what ever is on offer. Over a rack of 10 alpine draws the difference between edelrid's 8mm and 11mm is the weight of a single locker. ,Oct 2015,Jun 3 2020,2
5309,Dyneema slings,1,9, I think it comes down more to preference than weight or cost~ at least for me. I like the way the DMM/Mammut 8mm sling handle~ so that's what I get...the cost differential to me is insignificant.,Jul 2015,Jun 3 2020,2

5318,Anyone try the Arcteryx C-Quence harness yet?,1,8," Just bought one as well for 109$ since they are on sale to replace my 4 year old 365 that was getting pretty worn out. Expensive but not awful.  Its cheaper than my shoes and will last way longer.  I will try to remember to come back and post if it is appreciably different in comfort or form.   I have never worn a solution~ but the lack of ice clipper loops is a no go for me as mine gets heavy ice and alpine use and I don't like the clip on caritools.   Also~ of the harnesses I have tried the arcteryx harnesses are the only ones placing the ice clippers far enough forward for my preference.  Comfort is~ imo~ fine for multipitch but I would never take my 365 on a big wall again where I had to haul (ouch~ but no surprise) and I doubt the new version will be any different.  There is no better harness for a do it all alpine/ice/trad for me~ though seb is right in that it is certainly not as innovative a harness as it was a few years ago.   If the new version increases comfort by about ""10-20%"" I will be really~ really happy.",Jan 2016,May 25 2020,2

5325,Anyone try the Arcteryx C-Quence harness yet?,1,15, I’ve been climbing in one for a couple months now~ and I really like it. Coming from a MM Cadillac~ the weight/bulk difference is huge. It’s impressively comfy for hanging belays~ but the Cadillac probably still beats it out. If I were going to do a multi-day free climbing route~ I’d bring the C Quence~ but for aid climbing/a route in more traditional big wall style~ I’d pick the Cadillac.The gear loops are also really nice. Loop for loop~ they’re way bigger than the Cadillac. A single rack on one C Quence gear loop is a lot less bunched than on one Cadillac gear loop. Also you get the 5th haul loop on the back~ which is basically another mini gear loop. The Cadillac can hold more gear than the C Quence~ but most of us wouldn’t ever need to max either harness out. For me~ the gear loops sit far enough forward~ but when I cinch the waist loop down I only have about an inch left~ so if none of the sizes fit you properly you may find the gear loops to be too far back. The gear loops are very far forward on my Cadillac~ and that’s something I really like about it. I’ve been pretty exclusively working on a sport climbing project so I have yet to do much trad climbing in the C Quence. However on several occasions (mainly during rona) I’ve thrown the harness on and racked up with my full trad multipitch kit. It can handle it all with ease.  It’s also worth noting that I’ve never tried another Arc harness before. ,Apr 2019,Jun 2 2020,4

I thought they all did that to some extent.  i don't have much of their stuff but the few things I do I really like.  Not surprised they got bought up by some big conglomerate -- that is the lifecycle for basically all brands~ sorry.  The good news is that it creates space for new/small core companies.  ,Nov 2006,Jun 2 2020,0
5331,Anyone try the Arcteryx C-Quence harness yet?,2,0, In my opinion~ it's not so much that companies rip each other off~ it's more that outdoor/climbing equipment companies exist in a niche that's very prone to optimalization. It's much like the airplane industry or the F1 racing competition in that way. Human anatomy and ergonomics dictate that equipment works in a certain way. Storm hoods are a good example of that.  Now~ I would agree that a large corporate-owned company is much less inclined to experiment with new ideas because they might not be commercial~ but that's a different discussion. In that way~ Arc'teryx might be lagging a bit~ hence also their loyalty to an essentially stand-still (fine~ not anymore~ see their 2023 pledge to go PFC-free) technology such as Gore-Tex. ,Feb 2020,Jun 3 2020,0

5364,Anybody know where I can find this nut tool?,2,11, My eBay sniping strategy: Figure out the most you would pay for it. Say $150. Then add a little to that like $152. If someone pays $160 you should be able to say “they overpaid” not “damn I should have bid more”. Make sure your eBay account is in good order ready to bid. 15 seconds before the auction ends bid $152. eBay will automatically outbid the highest someone else has put in their max Bid. So if someone before you bid $135 your bid will go to like $137 to beat their bid. If someone put more in than you like $175 their bid will beat yours at like $154. the reason you do it at the last 10-15 seconds is if you outbid someone early they may decide to bid more and beat your bid. You want to bid the max you will pay and not give anyone a chance to beat it. There’s websites and apps that will snipe for you so you don’t have to be ready at that exact time.,Oct 2011,May 25 2020,5

Alas~ it's not~ but I may make a test piece with what I have just for fun. Shouldn't take more than an hour and I need the distraction right about now. I'm guessing that anything you can cold forge won't be strong enough to withstand the abuse a nut tool will take. I'd recommend using a steel like a 1040 or 1060. That or a type of easily hardenable stainless steel. (10 series steels will rust~ which isn't great) anything under a 1040 will probably deform too easily and anything over a 1060 will probably be too brittle.

5408,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,6,16, Have one and have been very happy with it.

5409,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,6,17, I have one in 70 meters and love it.   Had it for 1.5 years now and it's been super for all aspects of leading trad and sport but I agree with Emilio that I wish that the bi-pattern weave was a bit more apparent.,Nov 2018,May 30 2020,0
5410,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,6,18, I have one- didn’t like it all that much.  The dry treatment on it was strange- idk any other way to put it.  It was sticky-ish and didn’t glide through devices when new like all the other ropes I’ve owned.  It didn’t handle abrasion all that well either.  I’ve owned other Edelrid ropes that were far better.  Maybe I got a lemon~ idk.  I have yet to find anything with a better balance of weight/diameter~ handling and durability/longevity than Mammut.  YMMV.,Jul 2011,May 30 2020,2
5411,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,6,19, I've been using one for the last few weeks. It handles great with a Grigri (not too thick~ not too thin) and I love the bi-pattern. It's relatively heavy though~ so it wouldn't be my choice for long approaches or long multi pitches~ but it's great for an all-round workhorse rope.,May 2017,Jun 1 2020,0
5412,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,6,20, Had one as my only rope since summer of ‘18. Been climbing most weekends (mostly trad~ lots of rough JT stone) for about 1.5 years with it. I don’t fall a lot and could probably stand to push myself more. I can probably count on five fingers the number of falls this has taken. A good number of second/tr weights. I don’t baby my ropes or put them on tarps. They go right in the dirt/sand because ropes are meant to be used.It’s fine~ kind of on the heavy side~ but I don’t really mind. Considering how little I take care of it (with respect to dirt and grit exposure)~ it has done really well and looks great. It is getting pretty darn fuzzy and I’ve been shopping around for its successor. I thought it was actually rather stiff and had a brief period of a month or so when it felt nice and broken in. Bipattern is nice and I probably won’t go back to middle markers if my budget allows. Had a Mammut eternity that got lifted before~ and had a similar experience. Maybe it’s a dry rope thing. I’m thinking of getting the next one as a non dry coat~ but at the same time~ I toss my ropes in the sand. I’ve used non dry Mammut and Edelrid ropes that just felt so much better.,Aug 2017,Jun 1 2020,0
5413,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,2,0, If you don't like that stiff feeling then definitely try a non-dry rope and spend the savings on getting a rope tarp to throw down at the bottom of those sandy J-tree climbs. ,Jan 2016,Jun 2 2020,1
5414,Edelrid TC Pro Dry DuoTec 9.6 ,2,1, I’ve been climbing on one since May of ‘18. I can speak to Jake’s experience where at first~ the rope seemed sticky when new. I chalked it up to newness and the fact that it was being broken in in Kalymnos. Since then the rope has been awesome—durable and not yet fuzzy. Good structure still from what I can feel. The diameter feels smaller than 9.6~ and I haven’t had troubles spotting the bipattern change. Would buy again. ,Aug 2019,Jun 2 2020,0
5415,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,1,0, My new Mammut Infinity 60 m dry duodess weighs in at 65 g/m on my kitchen scale. This is about 10% heavier than the advertised weight of 59 g/m. Mammut responded to me with pretty reasonable explanation that delivered weight can be greater than production weight because they add 2.5 m to ropes to account for shrinkage over the life of the rope and because of absorption of atmospheric moisture.    Still~ I was expecting a lighter rope~ and I'm wondering if this discrepancy between delivered weight and advertised weight is common across models and manufacturers.

5431,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,1,16, It looks like a few other ropes also have advertised weights that are greater than their delivered weight. I guess it's good to know that mine isn't a complete anomaly.   After this I'm wondering if I should even consider weight as an important factor when choosing a rope because I'm unlikely to get what I expect. If there was a consistent bias across ropes then it would still make sense to choose a rope based on weight~ just expect 3-4 grams over whats advertised. But~ if the differences are more variable and possibly due to more than just extra length and moisture~ as some have suggested~ then maybe deciding between ropes based on small weight differences is pointless. Or maybe there should be some more well defined standards for advertising rope weight since the recent craze over thinner and supposedly lighter ropes suggests that weight is very important to a lot of people.,Aug 2007,Oct 18 2016,0

If you want to find out~ grab a bunch of clean~ unused clothes from your drawer~ weigh them~ then put them in the dryer to remove any humidity and weigh them again. That would give you an idea~ although nylon will absorb much less water than nylon~ so the effect would be amplified with cotton clothes.

5443,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,7," As I and ""SteveF"" mentioned~ the official way (IUAA?~ EC?) used by manufacturers to measure rope weight per meter is to take a piece (?? how long~ but probably about 2 to 3 meters) hang a 10kg weight from it for 1 minute. This puts some stretch in the rope. ( but less than  the ""% elongation"" percentage~ which is done with 80kg).   THEN~ mark a 1 meter length~ then cut rope at the marks~ and weigh the ""1 meter"" piece.

5449,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,13, I measured the 9.0mm rope and it came out to 73.55m instead of my assumed 70m~ dropping the weight to 57.7 compared to the claimed weight of 55. Taking into account the actual length of the ropes I measured~ it looks like that with the exception of the 10.2mm Maxim Glider (which I couldent measure its length)~ all the ropes are consistently 2-3 g/m over spec. If you consider that EN and UIAA specs call for a 10kg mass placed on the rope prior to measuring~ and we are measuring unweighted lengths~ it seems like the specs should not be more than 2g/m off.   As far as total weight goes~ I care more about the weight as expressed in g/m more than I care about the total weight of the rope. The rope's weight in my pack is less of a concern than it is when I am on the rock. I buy thin ropes not to make the approach easier~ but to make clips faster/easier and free movement more natural.   While a pound or two difference in your pack is negligible~ rope weight starts to compound as you climb further from the belay and clip more pieces to the rope. While an increase in rope weight of 5g/m only increases the weight the climber has to carry by 5g/m right off the ground~ once many pieces are clipped to the rope that value could triple.,Feb 2009,Dec 21 2016,0

5451,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,15, Let me clear-up a few things up here.   The measurements for everything that is stated by the manufacturer is covered by the two related standards: EN 892 and UIAA 101. EN 892 grew out of UIAA 101~ and the UIAA one gets updated first. The EN one has the European members of the UIAA Safety Commission on it~ and they most always use those exact same revisions for their revision.   The test labs do the measurements according to the standards: it's not a case of the manufacturer's being able to quote what they want to.   It's actually surprisingly difficult to have a consistent way of accurately measuring rope dimensions: length~ diameter and mass per unit length. Even marking the middle point is a bit tricky.   For single ropes~ you take a nominal length of 40m.   It is brand new~ and has been conditioned at controlled temperature and humidity.   The conditioning is quite complex~ but is critical to the measurements (dimensions as well as the drop testing): see below.   To measure dimensions~ you hang a 10kg mass onto this rope and measure   - Diameter: average of 6 measurements (if not round~ you report both max/min)   - Mass/length: measure a 1m length~ cut it out~ and weigh it   Conditioning:   Dry the test samples for at least 24 h in an atmosphere of (50 ± 5) °C and less than 20 % relative humidity.   Subsequently~ cool the samples in an atmosphere of (23 ± 2) °C and not more than 55 % relative humidity for2 h. Then condition these test samples in an atmosphere of (23 ± 2) °C and (50 ± 2) % relative humidity for at least 72 h. Then test these samples at a temperature of (23 ± 5) °C.

5452,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,16, About 10 years ago~ we did a round-robin and looked at how accurate the measurements were on the same batch of test ropes sent to a number of testing labs. As I recall~ the variation in weights was on average about 3%.   The length stated on the tag is a nominal one as you've been told: the manufacturer adds a bit more so that nobody can accuse them of selling too short a rope (legal issues in the States are a concern here).   And as I've described~ even measuring the length in a consistent/accurate way is somewhat complex. The rope stretches~ and absorbs moisture.   But what's the issue??    You are told that the rope is a certain length: if you want it shorter~ you can cut it.   You know the weight/unit length~ you can compare ropes using that.   If you want a lighter rope~ then buy one with a lower mass/length and/or use a shorter one.   I think there are other factors that are more important than weight:   - dry coating   - stiffness/modulus   - how often you replace it   And I'm a bit surprised that some people are willing to think the manufacturers would lie about these things. You're buying something that you trust with your life~ and yet you think they'd lie about something pretty irrelevant like its weight? If you don't trust them to be honest about that~ then how can you trust them to make the rope properly?   Alan Jarvis,Nov 2013,Feb 27 2017,0
5453,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,17, Dang~ I'm on a roll here.   Let's assume that the manufacturer's rope weights are not forged.   And that most people didn't use the correct rope length to convert the weight they measured to g/m.   You can easily get an extra 2 g/m as a result.   And more?   Well~ if your rope has absorbed water in it.   Nylon at 23 C and 55% RH has 2-3% water in it.   It can hold a LOT more: 9% easily absorbed in the nylon itself.   And more adsorbed on the outside of the fibres.   So the guys who measure more than 2 g/m over the rope's quoted mass/m might think why?   Maybe they've used them too long and the dry coating has gone.   It's like Goretex: doesn't last forever.   And their extra weight is water.   That's an issue: wet rope doesn't behave anywhere near as well as dry rope.   I suspect you should look at replacing your ropes more often if this is the case.   If you can afford to buy coffee at Starbucks~ you can afford to replace your rope more often.,Nov 2013,Feb 27 2017,0
5454,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,18, Some more data . . . I just bought the same rope as the original poster - a Mammut Infinity Dry 60m.  I let the rope acclimatize to the dry Denver climate (~30% relative humidity) for a couple of days~ and then weighed the rope at my place of work on two independent~ calibrated scales.  My rope weighs in at 8.64 lb (3.92 kg) with no packaging material or anything else.  I confirmed the measurement by placing calibration masses on the scales.  The rope has never been used.  I carefully measured the length with little/no rope stretch at 60.6 meters. This equates to a per unit length weight of 64.7g/m (compared to 59g/m listed on the spec sheet).  I was able to get someone else to weigh a brand new Mammut Infinity Classic 60m rope (same rope but with no dry treatment)~ and it weighed in at 3.89 kg.  To my surprise~ the dry treatment does not seem to really add any weight.  Perhaps the untreated rope absorbs enough atmospheric moisture to largely offset the weight of the dry treatment coating?  I understand from WarthogARJ's post above that there is a process defined by UIAA for measuring rope weigh per unit length which probably explains the discrepancy~ but the data here may be of use none the less.,Jan 2017,Oct 23 2017,1
5455,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,2,19," I just unpacked a 60m neon green edelrid canary. Edelrid claims a 51g/m. The rope is measured at 62.94m by me. But let's do that 63m. Because I'm easy going. Weight is 3~484g. Not a single gram more. Because I'm not THAT easy going. This is a pretty much disappointing 55.35g/m Allow me now to be a bit proactive~ concerning the two or three of you that are going to make a reference of the ""UIAA method"" and whether it was used in my calculations: TL;DR version: Please spare me the BS about UIAA method!  Full version: 1) A 10kg weight wouldn't elongate the rope even a meter. Maybe half a meter. Since static elongation for the given rope is 7.4% which accounts for a 4.662m for the overall length of 63m (mind you that's when you add a 80Kg weight on the rope). But I'm gonna spare you a meter~ ok? So add 51g from that extra meter Edelrid: 63m * 51g/m + 51g= 3~264g Reality: 3~484g (even if we consider that the actual value was 51~4g/m which was then rounded down to 51~ it's still not enough. The rope is still heavier than advertised. Just do the math for yourself...)  2) Humidity is even greater BS. In room temperature~ when air is saturated (Relative Humidity = 100%) with water it only holds 20g per cubic meter. I guess you understand how much LESS than a cubic meter is the volume of the rope! But in case you don't~ it's actually: π * r^2 * length which is 3.14 * 0~0086^2 * 63 = 0~0146 cubic meters. So the extra weight due to humidity is virtually...zero grams for the whole length. Which is pretty much normal if you consider that even in liquid form~ the maximum amount of water inside the rope is gonna be less than 3~213g * 2% = 64.26g for the whole 63m length! So even if you throw the rope in the sea and let it take a good soak~ you'd still have: 63m * 51g/m + 64~26g=3~277g (wet) Reality: 3~484 (dry)",Jun 2020,May 31 2020,0

Eeehm~ it's exactly 435g! Mind you~ that's on the same scale the rope was measured! (that's me being sarcastic). ok~ ok~ one last try~ the edelrid mega jul (announced at 65g). Suddenly the kitchen scale reads 72g. Maybe it's just broken after all! (That's me being sarcastic again) Funny thing is that I've already said that all other equipment has not even a single gram deviation in my previous post. But you keep insisting that the scale could be off. You are either really bad at reading other people's posts or.... an edelrid employee? (There's a 3rd option actually but I don't want to get banned). ""Arbitrarily"" treating the rope as a cylinder~ accounts for a volume of 0.0146m^3 and a total 0.0146m^3 * 20g/m^3 = 0.292g of added weight to the rope due to humidity. 0.3g in 3.2Kg! Do you really think considering the rope as a cylinder was the problem? Say I was off a rather improbable 100%(usually error is accounted for 2-7%) in my ""arbitrary"" assumption. Then the total difference is 0.6g! Again that's for the whole 3.2Kg of the rope! Would you like to say that my calculations are 1000% off? Just for fun? Then the added weight is 30g. Still~ the distance from Edelrid's claim to reality is 271g. I think your depth of understanding is missing another 240grams. So~ you see where this goes? It goes slowly but steadily to show that it's you the one who is completely out of his depth. The elongation problem. Forget about me treating the elongation as linear. Again~ just for fun~ let's use the 80Kg (not the 10Kg added weight during the UIAA standard): 63m with 7.4% elongation is 67.662m. And at 51g/m it SHOULD have been 3~450.76g But no.

5464,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,3,8," Giw~ I'm not saying this accounts for the entire discrepancy~ but ""A 10kg weight wouldn't elongate the rope even a meter"" is a big misconception.  I got numbers in the 5-7% range when I played with it (hard to define precisely because even with 0 weight the rope's length has a few % of hysteresis).",Oct 2015,Jun 2 2020,1
5465,How accurate is advertised rope weight?,3,9, As I posted earlier I measured 5~3% for a 10mm rope so a thinner one is going to be more. Using the static elongation figure is a waste of time as it is derived from a rope already stretched then measures the difference in length between a 5kg load and an 80kg load. And as noted above~ the 3% moisture content is the maximum industrial standard for the nylon stock before manufacturing~ the process may call for it to be higher or lower and what moisture content a particular batch of ropes might have is anyone's guess.,Nov 2009,Jun 2 2020,0

5477,One rope for both mountaineering and sport climbing or one for each?,1,0, I'm just getting into climbing but I'm particularly interested in mountaineering. I often climb with my friend who has plenty of ropes but I don't want to always depend on him for a rope. I'm thinking of either buying a longer~ high quality dry rope~ probably 9.5mm x 70m~ or a shorter~ 8-8.5 mm x 30 m dry rope for glacier travel and a separate 9.5-9.8mm non-dry rope for sport climbing with friends. My thinking with the first option is that I would suck it up~ and carry the extra long rope~ even during mountaineering and glacier travel (i tend not to mind extra weight on my hikes)~ or I could cut it into two separate portions. Maybe a 30m and a 40m? Any suggestions? My overall budget is $220.,Feb 2020,May 28 2020,0
5478,One rope for both mountaineering and sport climbing or one for each?,1,1, 30 or 40m is pretty short for a sport climbing rope and sport climbing thickness 70m is really long and heavy for glacier travel. Rock will also quickly wear away the dry treating on the rope itself and will result in you having to handle icy(er) ropes if you do one rope for both applications. Just get a cheap 70m rope for 100-130 bucks for sport climbing and then grab a separate dry treated rope for glacier travel. 2 independent ropes would work better for your needs imo ,Mar 2014,May 28 2020,7
5479,One rope for both mountaineering and sport climbing or one for each?,1,2, You are going to find yourself pretty damn limited doing anything in the mountains with a 30m short cord.  Complicated crevasse rescue?  Screwed.  More than two people?  Screwed.  Rappelling more than 15m?  Screwed.  If you will be doing a lot of mountaineering you will be spending big $$ on gas~ food~ boots etc so just buy a 60m rope.   If you want to go light and a bit cheaper just buy a HALF (not Twin) rated rope.  They do prove handy cragging on rock when you need to do full length rappels or top ropes.  Twins stretch too much to be useful anyway.,Oct 2010,Jun 1 2020,0

5481,One rope for both mountaineering and sport climbing or one for each?,1,4, When starting out and kit building~ buy the gear (rope) you need NOW. Don't buy the gear (rope) you think you'll need later. I'm guessing this translates into buying your own sport rope. Buy the one that will get the most use~ right away. Thus you will avoid the pitfall of making large purchases for something that never comes to pass. And you'll also discover you can get by on a lot less than our consumer colleagues will let on. One other thing about mountaineering ropes - its not just you that has to suck it up to carry a needlessly heavy rope. Your partner has to carry it too. A pair of half ropes served most of my mountaineering /alpine rock needs the best. Many times I only took a single half rope along~ if the anticipated rope work was short and light~ or the ground was super easy. Double it up if there is an odd cruxy section or something. Bring both ropes for more serious climbs or where multiple raps are needed. The great thing is each partner can carry one. My half ropes weigh 3 pounds each (60m) and some change and aren't very bulky~ so this makes for smaller packs too. In the end if you stick around you'll end up with lots of ropes. Sport cords~ big wall ropes~ static~ old fuzzy top roping retirees~ fast and light skinny and dry super-ropes~ on and on. Remember~ ropes are consumables~ just like slings and shoes. The ropes come and go. When you do get a super rope for your hard mountain sends~ only use it for its intended purpose. Use your other ropes for the day to day sporting and such. One final note - always climb on your partner's rope~ if she volunteers it. Better to use hers and save yours for the rainy day. But don't be a dick about it ;),May 2015,Jun 1 2020,4
5482,One rope for both mountaineering and sport climbing or one for each?,1,5, I had a similar question a few years ago when I started. Fortunately there is a very simple answer: get the longer rope for mountaineering. The only real question is between a 60m and a 70m. There are definitely established routes where a 60m just won't cut it - I was on one this past Saturday. Great route~ but two of four pitches were within 20 feet of 70m. Get something on the thin side and light. My 95.mm Maxim rope weighs 10 pounds~ which is sort of a lot for what I really want to do with it (peak bag CA 14ers)~ and is even sort of long for that purpose. But I can just get tougher by carrying the extra weight. Definitely look at the routes you intend to do most and sooner~ and buy the rope you need for that. One thing~ is that depending where you live you might have regular access to sport routes or shorter crags~ as opposed to long mountaineering routes. Get what you can use now to start with. That said~ the sport rope question is more complex. I don't want to whip on my 9.5mm over and over again (and have my buddies do it~ too) until it's wiped out before its time. In fact I'm looking at buying a new rope just for sport (because I need to get stronger). But I won't buy a nice dry treated rope for sport.,May 2020,Jun 1 2020,0

My comment on needing a 70 meter rope was in regard to non-mountaineering routes. Plenty of multi-pitch crags have 70 meter pitches.

5491,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,0," Imagine you are at the top of a single pitch crag~ and you are building an anchor in the ground 20 feet away from the edge. There is absolutely no gear between here and the edge (or even over the edge). You plan to use your long static to build an anchor in the ground and extend the masterpoint over the edge for a TR. You look on the ground and see a small crack that runs parallel to the edge of the cliff. Its around 000~ 00~ 0 TCU size and maybe 1.5"" - 2"" deep; but very strong/solid. Most would feel good about placing small cams here~ but you don't have any because you're an asshole non-conformist and you think you're cool~ so you bought used Ball Nuts instead~ on the cheap. It's not about the money though~ you're just an asshole.",Jul 2019,May 28 2020,19
5492,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,1, 3: I have always thought it would be best to put the ball in the direction of pull (down~ or towards cliff in your case) because if the ramp moves at all when weighted~ you certainly don't want it moving in a way that opens the path for the ball more~ but instead pinches towards the rock behind the ball. Make sense? Idk about the other stuff. In a shallow crack like that theyll stick up~ they're not much harder to place on lead than micro cams~ tiny range and all. also just buy microcams,Dec 2013,May 28 2020,2
5493,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,2, Ballnuts work fine in horizontals - I've whipped on them at the Gunks in tiny slots that would never fit a cam or nut (these horizontals are also commonly irregular due to large quartz crystals). The orientation of the ball itself doesn't matter - I would flip it whichever way increase the surface area in contact with the rock. You're question with the paddle side is the same answer as you would have with a nut. Just find the best~ most flush spot for the paddle and ball.   Ballnut heads are much much much narrower than small cams and have higher holding strengths (blue is 8kn). In addition to that~ the blue can protect seams smaller than grey C3s.  They are super useful and can give you bomb pro where there simply would be no other option - any small pockets~ pods~ and seams are where you would use them. If you don't have them on your rack in certain areas~ you won't have options to protect certain runouts. That being said~ the majority of climbers won't end up using them~ as they really shine on runout~ hard~ and poorly protected climbing with tricky placements - and the majority climbers are climbing moderates with obvious pro. I wouldn't buy ballnuts to substitute microcams or buy microcams to substitute ballnuts. Just buy both since they are intended for different kinds of features. It is a gumby attitude to think that they are in direct competition - since in reality~ they are meant to compliment each other. In your hypothetical you're talking about setting up a TR anchor on ballnuts. Given that if a ballnut walks it can be totally useless and given how small they are there is higher chance of rock feature breaking - I wouldn't feel good about setting that up. It would be roughly as sketchy as setting up a TR anchor on RPs or C3s - which seems pretty sketchy to me since micro gear needs to walk just a few mm to fail. Just sling a tree/block/etc or place some normal sized cams. That being said~ I have never encountered a TR where micro gear is the only option - pointless hypothetical imo. Also idk why would owning ballnuts make somebody an asshole? Lol Blue ballnut head width vs grey c3:,Mar 2014,May 28 2020,14
5494,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,3, Thanks for addressing some of the questions~ I appreciate it! Very helpful. You did catch me however. I am most certainly a Gumby insofar as I did think that they could be substituted~ as opposed to complementary; because they’re offered in the same size ranges. I’m not really worried about the rock breaking~ due to the forces on each piece in a 3 piece TR anchor. Additionally~ micro cam surface area is also very little; perhaps less. However~ the “walking” portion of your argument does seem to make sense. That is~ if a well “set” ball nut is actually more prone to walking than a micro cam?,Jul 2019,May 28 2020,1

5501,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,10, To be specific - It would depend on which ball nut vs which microcam. Micro cams have wider heads and will distribute the load of a fall over a wider area (i.e. across the three or 4 lobes). A ballnut will load a smaller~ single point of the crack or potentially even a single crystal in the case of the blue ballnut. I believe that the force is concentrated on a smaller area and is therefore more likely to break the rock - but maybe somebody will do some measurements~ math~ and experiments on - say - the grey c3 vs blue ballnut and get back to us on this - to see if my intuition is correct.  In a lab setting (perfect placements with rock that doesn't break) the grey c3 will fail far before the blue ballnut. But the real world isn't a lab setting and crystals do break and force placements to fail. Most micro gear failure is rock breaking - not the gear failing itself. Rule of thumb is that the smaller the piece~ the smaller amount of rock that would have to break in order to fail the placement (and smaller = more likely that the rock will break in the first place since the load is distributed over a smaller area). ,Mar 2014,May 28 2020,5

5506,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,15, Ballnuts and small cams can be great~ but they are marginal pro.  Ballnuts especially have to be placed with careful attention to the minute details of the crack~ and there are things you have to know about their set-up.  They are easily compromised if they rotate.  I would never build a top-rope anchor with that gear.  Find some better gear or find something else to top rope.,Feb 2008,May 28 2020,17
5507,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,16, Stress = force / area Agreed - this supports my intuition. Also agreed with rgold. Exclusively using micro gear for a TR anchor is an accident report waiting to happen and should not be done.  Once I climbed up to a partner who used the smallest DMM peenut~ purple c3~ and green c3 (the c3s were in the same feature/flake) to build a hanging belay for both of us. I tried not to say anything once I got to the anchor~ but I def grabbed the rack and plugged an actually reliable piece in ASAP right next to his micro gear hanging belay so that we both didn't die if one of us shocked the anchor with little rope out. Made me feel reeeeallly nervous - especially at the thought of leading out above that little nest with only a couple of sq centimeters of contact between us and a several hundred foot plunge to the talus below. ,Mar 2014,May 28 2020,3

5509,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,1,18, To shift the conversation a little: If one is looking at a strong~ reliable~ adequately angled and featured micro cam placement; it seems likely to me that a similarly sized ball nut could also be used in that situation. To paraphrase... what can a micro cam do that a ball nut cannot? It seems that rotation would be bad for both~ and walking would be bad for both~ which is obvious given their smaller range. However~ in our aforementioned scenario we’re working with a crack that is parallel to the cliff edge~ and directly perpendicular to the direction of pull. Let’s assume they’re equalized by a cordelette. It seems that the likelihood or rotation would be so low in this situation that it might be negligible.  Lastly~ the three-piece ball nut top rope anchor was merely a hypothetical. A much more likely situation would be a bomber medium sized cam~ a tricam or nut~ and the third piece being a ball nut in a horizontal.,Jul 2019,May 29 2020,0

5512,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,2,0, can't say for sure~ but it would seem plausible that a ballnut would have more surface area contact~ assuming you are just looking at total sum of contact areas of both sides~ than a similar size cam in a typical placement.  the radii of small cams is pretty small~ so the actual contact is pretty small.  the paddle on a ball nut has a pretty large surface area~ but the ball flat surface area is pretty small. as with everything~ probably depends on placement. if a microcam walks will it be useless?  well~ depends on where it walks to... demetri asked what a microcam can do that a ballnut can't - if you have a fairly shallow horizontal on a face~ or a shallow crack under an overlap a microcam will typically work better than a ballnut~,Dec 2004,May 29 2020,1

5524,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,2,12, Do you not have any pitons? Slam one in~ use it~ and then leave it for everyone else.  There was a time when that made sense~ a time when people knew how to place pitons and everyone had a hammer and knew how to test pitons in place.  Now its just clip and pray~ and some research in Europe I read maybe 10 years ago concluded that  even experienced climbers judgement about how good pitons are (without hammers to test them) was no better than random.  So no~ do not encourage a professed beginner who almost certainly knows nothing about pitons to place one and leave that potential time bomb for others.,Feb 2008,May 29 2020,5
5525,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,2,13," This summarizes my own personal way of solving such a problem: The original post/question was more of a thought exercise than a real-world problem I was trying to solve. It is much more interesting to ""go down the rabbit hole"" so to speak. As opposed to refraining from discussion just because there is little real-world application to the topic. ",Jul 2019,May 30 2020,0
5526,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,2,14, Hoping this was a troll?  I've never owned tiny cams or ball nuts. I've used hand placed pitons on very rare occasions.. The belay with a ground crack mentioned in the OP is a case where it won't fall out if the placement is good. It would be held in partly by leverage and the pull would only be coming from the direction of the belayer. In addition an extra tap with a stone probably wouldn't be much different from the a sharp tug or a tap with a nut tool that is sometimes used to seat nuts. A piton is usable if you drop a nut tool~ or for banging in with a rock for a retreat in extremis. However I do agree with your sentiments about hammered pitons.,May 2018,May 30 2020,0
5527,Ball Nuts in Horizontals,2,15, Yeah~ I didn’t get the sense Billcoe was advocating leaving a hand placed piton for others. I assumed by that part of his suggestion that he was saying to hammer one in and fix it. I have no experience with hand placed pitons~ but assume they’re never used as fixed pro. ,Oct 2007,May 30 2020,0

5530,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,0, Hi everyone~ this is my first post on the forums and I have a design question about webbing stitching. I’ve read as much material as I can about thread patterns~ stitch count~ differences in materials~ etc.~ and I’ve researched how to maximize joint strength and seen various videos about MBS testing. However~ I’m hoping someone might be able to help answer a question for which I cannot find an answer. Is there any relationship between the strength of a joint and the number of webbing layers stitched together? I need to make a tether with one anchor and three legs of different lengths. I know there are multiple ways of doing this~ but is one of the options below stronger than the other~ and if so which is the better choice? If I’m missing something~ please let me know!,Sep 2019,May 22 2020,0
5531,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,1, For option A I would make the red webbing also form the eye making what is likely the highest loaded point~ assuming your directions are also the direction of applied force~ double thickness and the stitch more straightforward since you don't need to consider missing the red a possibility. Edit to add: the better choice depends on what it hopes to achieve. Is being modular helpful? Then B if fewer items is preferred A. From an engineering standpoint changing the strength of the webbing is very easy and design for function should come first.,Dec 2013,May 23 2020,3
5532,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,2, To maximise strength you need to think more about the metal attachment point webbing bent over a small radius will weaken it considerably~ A is probably the stronger of the two but the design could be made to be quite a bit stronger. I'll roughly draw it up on my phone now. Edit: I forgot how bad my phone is for drawing.,Oct 2015,May 23 2020,3
5533,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,3, I’m not a webbing guy but I did study some structural engineering in college. When you look at a connection between two members joined by fasteners perpendicular to the direction of loading~ the fasteners experience shear stress. A connection can be “single shear” or “double shear” with examples of both below:,Oct 2017,May 23 2020,2
5534,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,4, One of the sections from OPTION B could have just one of the red sections from OPTION A for another variation.,Jun 2016,May 24 2020,0
5535,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,5, Thanks for the help everyone; appreciate it. I've made a few revisions as per the advice~ and I think the design is improved. While I understand there will always be shear loading to some degree in any application~ the purpose of the tether is for backup/redundancy and the loading - should it ever be required - will be in a linear direction (so any shear loading should theoretically be negligible). And thanks for the note~ but there is no requirement for it to be modular. Here's the revised design. Does this look better?,Sep 2019,May 24 2020,0
5536,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,6, You're not really taking advantage of the wider radius of the blue webbing~ that being said the weak points will be at th end of the tethers anyway so this seems like a pretty mute point. ,Oct 2015,May 24 2020,0
5537,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,7, Assuming the stitching is sufficient~ the weak point will be the same in both cases~ the places where it is just a single strand of webbing.,Aug 2019,May 24 2020,0
5538,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,8," Sewing 4 layers is getting close to real industrial... Why do you need 4 layers at all? What sort of loads are these legs supposed to take? What is the diameter of the snap hooks? as to your original Q ""Is there any relationship between the strength of a joint and the number of webbing layers stitched together?""  Yes~ as it will depend on the tension of the stitches through the webbing layers and having optimal interlocking right in the middle of the layers.  It sounds kinda tricky. What is the end use~ unless it is a secret?",Oct 2004,May 24 2020,6
5539,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,9, Option b has extra links in the chain- more chances for failure. Option a would be more fiddly if you most often need only two attachment point and have the third one dangling about.,Mar 2020,May 24 2020,0
5540,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,10, Thanks for the replies and information about the strength-to-layers relationship; I appreciate it. There is not any specific requirement for four layers~ I'm just trying to keep the number of links (e.g. potential failure points as Ackley noted) to a minimum~ and simplify the overall design as much as possible.,Sep 2019,May 24 2020,2
5541,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,11, In my estimation~ you are way over thinking this.  The load potential is so small~ that almost any configuration will work.  What I would do is probably make the main loop have two legs~ and insert one piece of webbing to make the third leg.   Top loop does not really need to be doubled~ but if you did~ do a Metolius style loop to make the webbing doubled at the connection point~ yet it does not extend into an increasing layers problem. I’ll try to add a diagram~ but on this device it might be impossible! edit:  in fact~ something like a standard or adjustable daisy chain gets you near infinite adjustment in the range is is totally bomber for the potential loads.  Have you looked into this??  Even a length of perlon with a RopeMan would sort you out good style.,Oct 2004,May 24 2020,3
5542,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,12, If I were you I would skip the sewing and get a rabbit runner and tie it like this. Or if you want some adjustability~ this might be an option though I don't know if the metal parts might have trouble in a marine environment.,May 2015,May 24 2020,3
5543,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,13," The ISO test for sailing lanyards is actually a drop test involving a 100kg weight~ in use they tend to be clipped directly to metal bits on the boat! And those are with min BL of 2040kgs (4500lbs). Most lanyards nowadays also have ""pop"" windows to show they have been impacted~ normally in the 2-400kg range. Child lanyards (depending on age) are nornally hitched to the harness~ first so they can't fiddle with the attatchment and second so they don't get smashed in the face by the karabiner. Three legs on a lanyard is going to be a nightmare~ two is bad enough!  ",Nov 2009,May 25 2020,3
5544,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,14, Maybe use cord instead of webbing~ with knots~ spliced~ or sewn eyes.  Also instead of a snap on each end~ use a single carabiner~ so hardware not being used isn’t flying around.,Jun 2016,May 25 2020,0

5547,Webbing Layering Design Question,1,17, What's it for? I would guess an adjustable tether but I suppose it could also be a multi-attachment tether though I doubt the latter because getting the length of the legs correct would be nearly impossible. If an adjustable~ why wouldn't you use something like a PAS? Having those extra attachments hanging around~ possibly with carabiners or snap hooks in them seems annoying but that's based on my assumed use.,Oct 2008,May 25 2020,0

I can’t sew it horizontal because I just have a home machine and it won’t work with my feed dogs.

5554,Webbing Layering Design Question,2,3, The loads in this application might surprise you. I have hit the end of my tether once~ after sliding down the deck of a boat heeled around 30 degrees~ and it was pretty jarring; I don’t want to think about what it would feel like to actually fall on a nylon webbing tether attached to a solid piece of deck hardware. There’s just no shock absorption in a system of PFD-harness/tether/padeye.  I second Jim’s recommendation to girth hitch it to the harness rather than using a carabiner. ,Oct 2017,May 25 2020,1
5555,Webbing Layering Design Question,2,4," Thanks everyone; I really appreciate all the ideas. Thanks for the suggestions. I hadn’t considered a length of perlon with a RopeMan~ but I don’t think it would be suitable (obviously the application is ""bulky"" now matter what~ but minimizing that is important). A main loop with a third inserted in between sounds like a good idea – I’ve redrawn the design below which looks much improved compared to the four layers of my second design. Does this look better?",Sep 2019,May 25 2020,0

5557,Webbing Layering Design Question,2,6, A jackline will definitely add some shock absorption to the system~ but will also deflect a ton - probably feet~ depending on the length of the jackline. You could probably mitigate that by running the jackline through a few intermediate padeyes but keeping the webbing continuous. ,Oct 2017,May 25 2020,1
5558,Webbing Layering Design Question,2,7, If only one lanyard at a time is to be attached~ they should be sewn together or formed from 1 strand to keep loose strands from tangling etc Dynamic cord with a scaffolding knot at each end and at the mid points would hold the snap hooks in place~ not tangle as easily~ and reduce the force of a fall.bluewaterropes.com/product/…,Mar 2020,May 28 2020,0

5564,Webbing Layering Design Question,2,13," Put an integrated ""fall arrest/load limiter"" on the main attachment point.... a couple of wings secured in a lycra sheath will take your shock load right out of the system.   All this is pretty simple to do with webbing~ but I still think you have sorta lost the plot on this thing~ and are going way ""overboard"" on the design.",Oct 2004,May 28 2020,2

5572,Webbing Layering Design Question,3,1," Another brainstorm~ have the metal snap hooks attached to the boat and have only webbing attached to the person avoid getting whacked by a loose tether. Russ and Jim brought this up so here is some more brainstorm. If you are planning to have some sort of indicator of force applied - a 42 stitch bartack of B69 nylon breaks at over 1 Kn in shear. Additional bartacks are somewhat additive but take more to hold the same ""weight"" as the force isn't distributed as evenly as the number of tacks goes up. The outside ones will take more of the load. B69 polyester might be more suitable to sailing elements~ I don't know but the breaking point would likely be about 7/10ths that of the nylon when new. The sail makers loft should be consulted for proper thread. So you could stitch it in a way to have the force first applied to an outer bartack(s) that would give way if those forces were exceeded~ in extreme events. More data to help make stuff safe for the little girl. ",Dec 2019,May 29 2020,0

5581,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,4," Are these sub 9 mm ropes burly enough to work routes with? What do you (asking everyone) use them for? I wouldn't. I use 9.8-10.2mm for working routes.  Different brand than the OP posted obviously but this is on Sterling rope's page for their 9mm  ""Due to the Nano's small diameter~ it is recommended that it only be used by experienced climbers and belayers and NOT for top-roping or working of routes.

5582,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,5," I agree with Kyle. Though I do know some smaller climbers ~125 lbs. that work routes on 9mm. They go through ropes more quickly than most do~ but they also work at gear shops and get employee pricing so they don't worry too much about durability. For me 6'3"" and 200 lbs. I trust these thin ropes~ but I'm not working routes with them. They get reserved for redpoint attempts or a route I'm thinking I have a good shot at onsighting.

5587,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,10, Yeah I used it a bit before I stopped climbing due to injury this year. First~ the way Edelrid coils their rope is second to none. It literally has a hole in the cardboard wrap that says “pull here” and you just pull it into a pile. No unrolling. No knots. Perfect. I could buy another Edelrid just for that. Even better than Mammut. The rope feels fat 8.6. A Beal Opera 8.5 doesn’t work in a GriGri. A Mammut Serenity 8.7 does.

5592,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,15, It's 50g/m. That's pretty damn light~ and adds up over 70m. My intended use case for a rope like this is climbing at my limit(not working a route)~ or alpine climbing~ where the weight of the rope on an approach matters~ but likely won't be weighting the rope except on rappel.  The Canary is listed as 51g/m~ which is only 1g/m lighter than a 9mm Nano.  I am not sure I would trade the weight of a couple biners for the increased risk of belay accident.,Jan 2001,Apr 20 2018,1
5593,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,16, The Canary is listed as 51g/m~ which is only 1g/m lighter than a 9mm Nano.  I am not sure I would trade the weight of a couple biners for the increased risk of belay accident. I wouldn't be surprised if the canary is more durable than the nano~ as it appears to be much denser and has a more substantial sheath. The nano is one of the least durable ropes I have ever owned.,Jul 2013,Apr 20 2018,1
5594,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,17, The Canary is listed as 51g/m~ which is only 1g/m lighter than a 9mm Nano.  I am not sure I would trade the weight of a couple biners for the increased risk of belay accident. I now have both. The Canary is the superior rope in seemingly all regards. MUCH tougher sheath~ ever so slightly lighter~ and generally better hand to the rope. Despite being spec'd as being thinner than the nano 9~ it's got roughly the same amount of substance to it~ but more concentrated in the sheath~ which makes it seem surprisingly durable. I haven't had issues with it being too thin and hard to handle~ granted I only use it with assisted locking devices as one probably should with super skinny lines. ,Apr 2012,Apr 20 2018,2
5595,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,18, Wow~ that's a pricey rope!   If I had one of them~ I'd probably baby the thing and only use when nothing else would do.  ,Jun 2011,Apr 24 2018,0
5596,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,19," happy to hear that Canary is doing well! i might just have to pick one up! Edelrid also making an ""Eco 8.9 Swift~"" passes the dry treatment~ no PVCs~ made of reclaimed fibers from their production process---i've loved my 8.9mm Swifts in the past~ so the Eco sounds rad....",Sep 2009,May 4 2018,0
5597,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,1,20, Any other feedbacks about the Edelrid Canary 8.6? I'm planning on buying a half rope~ so my initial bet was going for the classic Mammut Genesis 8.5~ but when browsing I came across the Canary~ and because of a sale~ I can buy either for roughly the same price. It's triple rated~ so it's on the league of Serenity~ Switft and the like. But even then~ comparing it side by side with the Genesis (or even the Kestrels)~ other than having 2-3 extra g/m~ the Canary seems same or better in almost every aspect~ and durable as well (sheath 47%). And being triple rated! Does it make sense for using it as a main half rope? Any feedbacks from experience using ti? Or any comments about durability? Thx in advance!,Sep 2018,Sep 10 2018,2
5598,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,0, Hey Tom! I wish I could give you better advice regarding durability---but I've only had my Canary a few weeks....handles very nicely~ super svelte.....I wish Edelrid imported the other color (they make an orange version in Europe)~ so I could rock both cords when leading for two followers.....but I digress!  I'll definitely let you know how the Canary wears....for what it's worth~ another 10% sheath content over the Opera (51g/m vs. 47g/m for the Opera) seems like it will dramatically increase durability.....perhaps less of a concern if you're using them as ice lines..... But I'll keep in touch and let you know....Rob ,Sep 2009,Sep 10 2018,1
5599,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,1, Are these sub 9 mm ropes burly enough to work routes with? What do you (asking everyone) use them for? I use Decathlon Edge 8.9mm 80m for everything sport. When it wores out I just cut 10' or so. It is long enough to survive half a dozen those shortenings and it is cheap as shit so it is no brainier (but a bit of environment impact shame) to get another one as the current rope becomes too short.,May 2013,Sep 11 2018,0
5600,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,2, Hi Tom! I’ve used the 50m Canary for easy alpine ridges in Austria/Germany and am very pleased with the rope. Definitely feels more stiff than my Mammut but also more durable. After much deliberation~ I chose it over the Mammut Serenity because of the higher sheath percentage. Still to find out how well it holds up but I am positive so far. ,Jun 2017,Sep 11 2018,1
5601,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,3, I have the Edelrid Boa and I've been thrilled with it so I'll always give a +1 for Edelrid. That being said I'd get the heeby jeebies whipping on that dental floss. I'm sure it's great and lightweight as hell but personally I'd have durability concerns getting that thing on a single rope.,Mar 2017,Sep 12 2018,1
5602,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,4," Thx for all the feedback folks!! Everywhere I've looked for info~ there were only words of praise for Genesis' durability (and Mammut's in genera~ which I`m aware of~ having a mammut rope myself). As for the Canary~ other than the ones here~ there weren't many reviews out there~ which I guess has to do with it being rather ""new"". However~ I think I'll go for the latter because of the extra versatility it offers~ being single rope as well. On this regard~ from what I've seen so far~ the rope is unique. All the other <9 triple rated ropes I've heard about~ have a smaller sheath ratio (35%ish)~ mainly because they need to make space for a core strong enough to meet single rope standard. At this point is where the Canary is one of a kind: it does meet such standard while still keeping a large sheath proportion (47%)~ and everything in just 8.6mm. Since the model wasn't released long ago~ guess it'll take some years to see its results on the field~ though from your feedback and others I read..so far so good BTW~ Jozsef~ which Mammut rope model do you refer to~ when saying the Canary is stiffer? And yeah~ I agree it may look as a dental floss when used as a single rope. But guess that single rope rating is meant to be used in particular alpine conditions~ and not for working a route on the crag.",Sep 2018,Sep 16 2018,3
5603,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,5, Tom~ it's a Zopa 9.7mm~ definitely much softer~ also a great rope. ,Jun 2017,Sep 18 2018,1
5604,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,6, someone did a review of sub 9mm ropes recently~  which included swift and canaryhttp://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2018/10/13/comparison-review-sub-9mm-climbing-ropes/ any longer term updates on durability guys?,Oct 2018,Nov 3 2018,1
5605,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,7, Hi Senders~ I'm currently in Vegas~ climbing on the Canary daily....so far so very good! Did Frigid Aire Buttress today~ which requires double-rope rappels~ so we took the Canary and an Edelrid Apus 9.7mm half rope.....belayed them both with a MegaJul and performed well. Used the Canary yesterday as well~ will spend the remainder of the week using it....more soon. ,Sep 2009,Nov 3 2018,0
5606,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,8, Home from Vegass....great week out there with the Canary (triple rated)~ as well as an Edelrid Swift Eco 9.8 (triple rated) and Edelrid Apus 7.9mm (half/twin)... Did DOWT~ some sport-wanking~ Cookie Monster to Cat in the Hat~ short-roped some guests a bit (not a ton)....photo'd the Canary after the week and impressed with how it came thru. I tried to photo the only fuzziness I could find~ which wasn't much at all. Check it out. I was obviously careful with the ropes all week~ check out the pics. The Canary's 47% sheath percentage seems worth the extra 3g/m compared to the Beal Opera 8.5mm single. Loving the rope--probably 50 pitches on it so far. ,Sep 2009,Nov 15 2018,2
5607,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,9,,Sep 2009,Nov 15 2018,1
5608,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,10, Inspired by another post~ I weighed a brand new Edelrid Canary 8.6mm 70m rope. It is 4115g. I didn't measure it's actual length~ but if it's actually 70m~ that's 59g/m. If it actually measured 75m~ and it that's way too generous~ that would still be 55g/m. It specs at 51g/m~ which should be 3570g for 70m.,Oct 2007,Dec 15 2018,3
5609,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,11, I use the Serenity 8.7 for typical trad and ice. I use a Mammut Revelation 9.2 for working routes/sport. I weigh 168-175 depending on how badly I have to poop. I want the Canary for trad~ but if it turns out to be durable~ I don’t see why I wouldn’t use it for working routes~ especially if it works with a Grigri2 (the 8.7 Serenity does~ the 8.5 Opera doesn’t). I'm not sure you want to buy another belay device (vs a rope that works) but~ doesn't the GriGri Plus and new GriGri (2019) get down to 8.5? That's what I remember seeing in a review video~ anyway. ,Feb 2016,Dec 15 2018,1
5610,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,12, I'm not sure you want to buy another belay device (vs a rope that works) but~ doesn't the GriGri Plus and new GriGri (2019) get down to 8.5?

5611,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,13, Any recent usage updates on the Canary?,Nov 2009,Apr 18 2019,1
5612,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,14, I find that a low mile petzl reverseo works well with the skinnys(opera) . When the device gets worn save it for fatter ropes.  I think the weight specs on many small ropes are wrong. Buyer beware.,Nov 2017,Apr 19 2019,0
5613,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,15, So far~ so good with the Canary....bunch of days guiding with it and some short-roping. The 47% sheath percentage seems like it's proving very durable. I begged Edelrid for the other color (orange)~ but they don't import it. Damn! Trailing two of these while guiding 2:1 would be great....I'm loving the Canary....wish I had it in a 70~ as it'd be an awesome Vegas rope. I have their Swift in a 70~ which is abso phenomenal~ too......,Sep 2009,Apr 20 2019,1
5614,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,16, I caved and got the Canary from EPICTV for 10% off Can’t wait to try it out ,Nov 2009,Apr 25 2019,2
5615,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,17, Edelrid rep says they will be importing a second color on the Canary to the states - I believe 2020 but I can't remember what they said now (plus I'm also remembering them saying bright pink - but we talked about a lot of stuff so we might be mis-remembering).,Apr 2015,Nov 13 2019,0

5617,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,2,19, yes~ the second color is pink...and yes it's awesome............and......i'm a fucking idiot because.......my Canary was still in awesome shape~ after 2.5 weeks of guiding on it in september over here in chamonix.........so we just moved into a new house and i left my rope on the floor of the new garage...and guess what~ our heating is via an oil boiler. fucking oil residue on the floor and it picked up oil spots all over the rope. fuck me. i gotta retire the thing......... that said~ i'll be getting a new green and a new pink for ice/rock........best rope i've ever owned. totally fantastic. i'll prob get a 40m for alpine stuff too~ next summer.  great rope~ idiot owner.

5618,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,3,0, I’ve got a new in package green canary I’d sell for a real good deal. Hit me up in a PM if you’re interested. ,Apr 2012,Nov 13 2019,1
5619,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,3,1, This summer I climbed about 25 pitches on alpine granite with two friends (both following at the same time on separate ropes). We used a brand new 70m dry Edelrid Canary and a brand new 70 m dry Mammut Serenity. Without a doubt~ the sheath of the Edelrid Canary wears out more quickly.,Sep 2010,Nov 13 2019,4
5620,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,3,2, I don't know how it's going to hold up with time (I just unpacked a 60m neon green edelrid canary) but I definitely know that the weight per meter is rather off. 51g/m edelrid claims~ 55.35g/m I'm measuring.  (3~484g weight and 62.94m length) I feel quite disappointed since I mainly purchased it for its small weight. I'll follow up with some more info after some months of usage.,Jun 2020,May 31 2020,1
5621,Edelrid Canary 8.6 Single Rope,3,3, Did you measure the rope using the uiaa method? What were the environmental conditions that the rope was stored in~ the tolerances of the tools you are using?Those are the type of factors you need to consider when dealing with 4 g/m of rope. ,Dec 2013,May 31 2020,0

5623,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,1, Lowe’s are the best packs I have.  Used one for a school book bag~ another for climbing and overnighters~ a third dedicated to Ice climbing ,Mar 2014,May 26 2020,2
5624,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,2, My GF owns a hiking daypack by Lowe Alpine and she seems very happy with it.  Myself~ I only have experience with their military rucks but they are some of the burliest and indestructible packs out there~ so I can't imagine their climbing/alpine packs to be anything else if you pick the right one for its job.,Feb 2020,May 26 2020,0
5625,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,3, I used to own a Lowe Alpine Attack 40~ indestructible and comfy yes but super heavy (even more by today's standards) If its for alpine I say go with the fossil bird instead or~ even better~ an Exped Black Ice 45,Dec 2019,May 26 2020,2
5626,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,4, My experience was very different - many points of failure in a short time~ and poor warranty support. I had a Gregory before and an osprey subsequently~ both held up much longer than the Lowe.  I had it for a couple of years~ happy when I tossed it in a dumpster.  Sound like my experience is unusual~ though.,Oct 2005,May 26 2020,0
5627,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,5, I find it really interesting that the OP and first 3/4 of folks that have replied are from outside of North America. For years LAS packs were found many shops in the USA. They were as noted indestructible and comfortable but heavy. I took one up the Cassin Ridge 20 years ago. Sold it soon afterwards because of the weight. For some reason their major market is outside the USA now. As for the particular packs in question~ Arc'teryx has no top lid which is a deal breaker for me and the little pocket seems unfunctional when the pack is full. Top pockets are are quite useful for small items that one wants quick access to.,Jul 2007,May 26 2020,0
5628,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,6, I have a Lowe Alpine Alpine Ascent 40:50 - fucking great pack. Even wrote a review of it for the CLIMBER (NZAC magazine) in 2017ish.  PM me if you want a copy of the review. Yes~ Allen - Lowe is much more popular in Europe/outside of NA since the early 2000's.   I remember working at EMS in 2001 and all of our best packs were Lowe Alpine.  Good stuff. Pretty sure the alpine ascent has been discontinued in favour of the Halcyon.  The ascent is a better pack~ though~ I think.,Apr 2006,May 26 2020,4
5629,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,7, I agree that LA packs biggest market seems to be outside the States now~ but my experience with one was maybe 20 years ago~ I don't know their situation now. ,Dec 2019,May 26 2020,0
5630,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,8, I've been using the Lowe Alpine Ascent Superlight 30 Pack for the past couple of years for ice climbing and mountaineering. After two years the bartacking on the webbing is starting to pull out a bit~ some of this has been caused by over packing. The small zip pocket on the top of the pack has worked well for small easy access items with out the need for a lid.,Oct 2013,May 26 2020,0
5631,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,9, I often have extra gloves in the pocket or a hat. Not to mention some food. Nothing that I might need immediately but stuff that I do not want to rummage around for inside my pack and are too bulky for jacket/pant pockets.,Jul 2007,May 26 2020,2
5632,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,10, HMG's new Prism Pack appears to be the best way to spend your Trump check.,Mar 2011,May 26 2020,1
5633,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,11, This is probably based on prejudice but I would be very wary to use a Dyneema pack on rock. Or is that old school thinking and has it made leaps and bounds in terms of abrasion resistance?  It looks great though. ,Feb 2020,May 27 2020,1
5634,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,12, Then I have the same prejudice as you~ even if technicaly there should be more robust than Ripstop nylon. ,Dec 2019,May 27 2020,0
5635,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,13, Most packs before had been made using a non woven dyneema which was layers of non woven dyneema layered at 60° angles laminated between thin polyester films~ this lead to shit puncture and abrasion resistance but excellent tensile strength and tear resistance~ terrible for an alpine pack but very good for ul backpacking. It would appear though the hyperlight mountain gear pack in question is actually made out of a woven dyneema the best fabric you could have a pack made out of~ and yes it really is that much more durable than nylon. ,Oct 2015,May 27 2020,0
5636,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,14, Aha for what it's worth I found them on a US site~ and was considering ordering them via the States (I'm an expat).,Apr 2019,May 27 2020,0
5637,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,15, I've had a lowe alpine pack for the last 6 years and it's been really durable~ stripped off the lid and metal frame it's a very respectable weight~ that being said these days I'd probably be buying an alpha fl 45 or making my own. I miss the days ueli steck mountain hardwear packs. ,Oct 2015,May 27 2020,0
5638,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,16, This is a good review assessing most of the packs the modern alpinist should be considering now (minus the FL 45~ and the Prism) and it evaluates a smaller version of the Lowe pack that you are considering:https://www.thealpinestart.com/2020/05/24/comparison-35l-alpine-packs/ Raf rates the Lowe one position higher than the Mutant 38~ which means it must be worthy~ because Mutants are awesome. The Blue Ice Warthog 45 is also worth considering~ but I find myself using the Mutant a lot more than the Warthog - probably because I usually value load carrying comfort over lightweight. What would be the love child of a Mutant and a Warthog? Something to ponder...,Oct 2018,May 27 2020,3

5640,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,18, Why the FL 45 over the Lowe? The roll top~ taped seams and weight make it allot more attractive to me~ I've used an fl45 and overall it's just a bit better than the lowe pack for usability and the front pocket is nice to have over a giant brain. An issue I do see happening with the arcteryx pack will be the bottom wearing out~ but it's such an easy patch I wouldn't be concerned about long term durability of the bottom.,Oct 2015,May 27 2020,1

5642,Lowe Alpine packs?,1,20, I had an older Alpine Attack 35:45 for about 7 years and loved it. I recently bought the newer version of the same pack. The hip belt is my favorite feature. I love the ability to have a padded hip belt for longer approaches and descents while being able to peel it back to just webbing to fit around my harness. As noted~ it can also be stripped down quite a bit. I did not like the ice tool/axe setup on the older models~ but this seems to have been improved on the newer version.  I used my first pack for cragging (ice and rock) along with longer trips in the mountains. I put it through hell~ and it still works fine. The hip padding started to wear through~ so I replaced it in preparation for longer days this summer. I still plan on using the old pack for cragging.  I tried the Warthog as an alternative~ but the hip padding did not hit in the right places.,Aug 2013,May 30 2020,0
5643,Lowe Alpine packs?,2,0, Gabe- Did you purchase your Lowe pack in a store or online? I live in Seattle too~ and it seems like it's been years since I've seen Lowe packs in any store~ and their overall precense in North America seems very minimal for at least a decade or more now.

5655,Scarpa P6000 Inner boot replacement.,1,10," John- Hi~ not exactly addressing your original question but maybe this can help.  I didn't like the inner boots to my P6000's and switched them to LaSportiva's Bruntse liner (yes it bulges the zipper a tad where the wrap around velco ""closure"" sits but didn't affect my climb or seem to lead to crazy early wear).  My original inner boots have ~20 miles in them.  Size 44 (can't remember how their whole/half sizes work~ something about sharing a shell and different liners or vice versa).  I don't plan to ever use them again so if you want them LMK.

5660,TNF Futurelight Jackets,1,3, The ice climbing guides for the Michigan Ice Festival this year were given them as their guide jackets. I never really asked from a technical perspective~ but one of the guides said specifically that they loved the jacket! I did not hear any complaints from the others. You could probably even give the local shop that hosts the festival~ Down Wind Sports (Marquette~ MI) a call and ask for David - I'm sure he'd be happy to give you the rundown on the jacket! I suspect the jacket does an incredible job of regulating heat and keeping you dry. Cheers!,Jan 2019,May 29 2020,1

5662,TNF Futurelight Jackets,1,5, Its essentially the same technology as OR's ascentshell which has been on the market for 5 years. Its called a nanospun or electrospun membrane~ its crazy light~ crazy breathable~ and has the wind protection of mesh screen. Seriously~ when using both ascentshell and futurelight the wind was sapping TONS of heat from me. That being said its very stretchy and supple so it does feel nice to climb with. Feels about as water proof as youll ever need with the added benefit of not getting doused with sweat. Honestly I still prefer gore tex as a whole though,Jan 2017,May 29 2020,2

5669,Learning to resole,1,0, I want to start learning the craft of resoling my climbing shoes.  Unfortunately I have two largely different sized feet which means I have to buy two pairs of shoes~ making it very expensive each time one of my shoes has gone bad.  I was wondering if anyone has any advice for resoling~ any tips or wisdom would be greatly appreciated. ,Jun 2019,May 21 2020,0
5670,Learning to resole,1,1, I've always considered in trying to resole later on in my future as I usually do everything myself when it comes to repairs and tuning such as snowboards/ski's. My number one question is the source for the rubber. If it's affordable then it's worthwhile to try to do it yourself. If you save only $5-10 a pop then it might not be until 10-15 resoles later it pays off and it'd be better to pay a pro and support a local business.,Jan 2020,May 21 2020,0

5672,Learning to resole,1,3, Sadly~ it seems some of the shoes being produced now are disposable. I was told by RRR that the re-sole of my 5.10 Gambits could not be warrantied. The construction made it impractical to re-sole.  The Tarantulace seem very similar to the Gambit.,Jul 2015,May 21 2020,0
5673,Learning to resole,1,4, Resole home kits were very popular when I was a young climber. It would take an entire Saturday~ you would park your car tire over them to cure~ you lost some brain cells due to glue fumes & they came out horribly. Thank God for resolers. PS. Years ago~ I had a self taught guy resole tons of my rock shoes. He lived in Kent~ Washington (about 30 minutes south of Seattle). Then one day he disappeared. 3 day turnaround & the work was unmatched & ive used them all. You pick the thickness or request a specific edge bevel &  he’d give it to you. Nobody in the business does this now.,May 2009,May 24 2020,6
5674,Learning to resole,1,5, why would anyone want to resole Tarantulace? $50 to get them resoled~ $60 for a brand new pair. Or~ maybe even a better use of money to try buying a shoe that's actually good and will hold up.,May 2018,May 24 2020,5

5681,Learning to resole,1,12, finding rubber is a problem. And it is ridiculous that a 5mm 2by3 Vibram sheet is 205 bucks. Especially that is made out of the cheapest~ most common type of rubber out there. Not complaining it works well ;-) the other thing you need is lasts. Shoe lasts makes a big difference. If I ever get off this website and get my ass in gear I will make a video tutorials on how to make lasts~ a sole press  and to resole like a pro with basic tools. It is not that bad and does not that long.  The gluing is a little tricky. better than waiting 3 months for a resole,May 2017,May 28 2020,1

5692,Learning to resole,2,2,  Some cobblers are better than other~ but all the resoles are hack jobs. Personally~ in 20 years of climbing I never had a  resole last as long as the original sole lasted. Even when I resoled with 5mm rubber.

5703,La Sportiva Solution Comp - opinions,1,0, Hello~ Anybody had a chance to try new Sportiva’s Solution Comp? What would they compare best with? I climbed in the original Solutions for a year and found them really good~ especially because they are stiffer than my order shoes (Skwamas~ Testarossa’s). From the reviews it sounds like they are basically pointier Testarossa’s with velcro and the stiffness „advantage” is gone...,Jun 2020,May 29 2020,0
5704,La Sportiva Solution Comp - opinions,1,1, I have them and am glad. They compare best with a very broken in pair of solutions. They are softer feeling than the skwama and obviously a completely different shape. Although I suppose they are a similar stiffness to the testarossa~ they don't feel similar or redundant to me. They are my new favorite for very steep climbing. Like I said~ to me they feel most similar to a pair of very broken-in solutions just before I would send them to the resoler. They wouldn't be my choice for sustained edging~ but they excel on anything smeary or pockety and steep. Edit to add: I think the increased softness of the solution comp is a product of the softer~ less structured heel rather than from a softer midsole or forefoot. The shoe (mine are still pretty new~ maybe 15-20 pitches) doesn't feel mushy like a slipper when toeing down~ and is similar under the toe to a normal solution~ but flexes a lot more throughout the whole foot and gives more when smearing.,Mar 2010,May 29 2020,3

When we asked why~ Black Diamond said that it was a manufacturing nightmare and that it was more complicated than just needing to raise prices.

5714,BD gets rid of hoodwire,1,7, I watched some YouTube videos on new BD products...between MP and YouTube comments~ its evident BD is making some poor choices and customers aren't happy. New gumby climbers looking to invest will spend money and this is most likely what they are banking on.

DMM does a great job with the Alpha~ but my favorite is the Camp Dyon.  My racking biners for my first set of  C4's are all Dyons~ and for my doubles are neutrino's (already owned them).   Dyon's have a really slim nose profile~ you can snag a nut wire inside of a thin crack much easier than any other biner.

5730,BD gets rid of hoodwire,2,2, I think the more important note here is with hoodwire tech gone they're going to quit making the livewire draws. That's the only good carabiner in their line up~ rivals the spirits for nice sport draws. I have a few OZ still~ used them on alpine draws and got sick of not being able to clip old pins/homemade hangers.

5744,BD gets rid of hoodwire,2,16, Buck~ I surely prefer Dyon~ alpha trad/light~ and helium over Ange~ but I have about 12 Ange (mostly L) and love them for racking nuts~ there's no better biner for nuts~ period.

5751,BD gets rid of hoodwire,3,3, I wonder if those Italian ones will be as light as the Oz. That's the only hoodwire that beats any of the other snag-free competitions at anything of note. The full weight hoodwire models aren't any better than the biners on nice sport draws.,Jul 2013,May 29 2020,1
5752,BD gets rid of hoodwire,3,4," I have almost fully switched to the miniwire for my core trad rack and like them as much as/more than the OZ. An they are comparably dirt cheap. The ""snag free"" thing is more of a sport climbing problem in my opinion anyways.",Mar 2016,May 29 2020,0
5753,BD gets rid of hoodwire,3,5, The Italian company (Climbing Technology) lists the biner with the hoodwire nose at 38 grams.  It certainly doesn't seem like it will be much of a competitor for Chimeras or Heliums.,Jul 2010,May 29 2020,0

5760,Black Diamond OZ carabiners discontinued?,1,6, The geometry of the Oz never worked in my average sized hand.  It didn't feel secure and always felt like it was going to slip upward and out.  IMO~ the similar size/weight DMM Phantom is much more comfortable to hold.  I'm interested to try the BD replacement.    ,Oct 2017,Jul 9 2019,3

5765,Black Diamond OZ carabiners discontinued?,1,11, Interesting design... Looks like the nose doesn’t protrude further than the gate~ which I would expect to be less than ideal for clipping rope into~ but wouldn’t matter for holding the biner and clipping it into other things.

5770,Black Diamond OZ carabiners discontinued?,1,16, Anyone have pictures or specs on the new version? The patent looks promising~ but not enough to stop me from replacing the rest of my OZs on my rack with nano 22s.,Dec 2015,Jul 15 2019,1
5771,Black Diamond OZ carabiners discontinued?,1,17, Nanos have a real small radius in the rope basket and trying them on the rope side of alpine draws I noticed significantly more drag on long pitches (45-70 meters) than when I had OZs. The gates also get sticky.,Jan 2015,Jul 16 2019,3
5772,Black Diamond OZ carabiners discontinued?,1,18, Nanos have a real small radius in the rope basket and trying them on the rope side of alpine draws I noticed significantly more drag on long pitches (45-70 meters) than when I had OZs. The gates also get sticky. Interesting. I haven't strictly done this experiment~ although I've climbed lots of long pitches with the mixture of OZ and nanos on my rack it's not been systematic. I notice rope drag when I screw something up more than based on the biners. Common observation? ,Dec 2015,Jul 16 2019,0
5773,Black Diamond OZ carabiners discontinued?,1,19, Interesting. I haven't strictly done this experiment~ although I've climbed lots of long pitches with the mixture of OZ and nanos on my rack it's not been systematic. I notice rope drag when I screw something up more than based on the biners. Common observation?  My partner thought the same when we tried the nano vs OZ/astro on the rope side. The less the rope has to bend around a biner the less you'll notice this. Problem is on the moderate terrain we're usually running 50-70 meter leads it's usually more wandering and single slings can't always get you a straight enough rope run. ,Jan 2015,Jul 16 2019,1

5788,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,1, A few nylon for racking and/or cleaning and dyneema for all else. Nylon are cheaper and more comfy over the shoulder with gear hanging off them. ,May 2015,May 26 2020,1
5789,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,2, Nylon.  More versatile.,Jul 2012,May 26 2020,1

5791,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,4," I have exactly zero nylon single length runners and a whole pile of dyneema. Have a couple of double length runners in nylon~ dyneema~ and the ""supertape"" blend made by Sterling and Trango (and others?). Dyneema is lighter~ packs smaller~ and doesn't freeze up. If you need to cut and tie dyneema~ it's a bit of a pain~ but I'm not in the habit of doing that too often~ so it's a non-issue for me.",Mar 2012,May 26 2020,6
5792,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,5, Nylon for anchor slings~ Dyneema (dynex) for extending pro. Nylon stays strong longer and doesn't slip as much when used in a girth or clove hitch. Dyneema is lighter and thinner.,Oct 2011,May 26 2020,3
5793,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,6, All my alpine draws are 8mm dyneema slings from Mammut and DMM. My over the shoulder slings that I use are the Sterling nylon 24 inch~ as well as some 30cm nylon slings for shorter extensions.   It was just trial and error that I found this combo that worked for me. ,Jul 2015,May 28 2020,2
5794,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,7, dyneema for alpine draws~ have a few nylon kicking around still use em for random stuff mostly for sport dogbones~ have a few dyneema with light carabiners for weight saving trips~ but mostly use nylon for projecting and grabbing draws and stiffer so easier to clip. (all my sport draws have 18cm slings and get mixed use for sport and trad),Apr 2015,May 28 2020,1
5795,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,8, I do not own a sewn nylon sling. 8mm Dyneema for almost everything~ plus a few of the BlueWater Titan double lengths for anchors. ,Oct 2017,May 28 2020,3
5796,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,9, I use skinny slings (Dyneema/Spectra) for alpine draws~ but have a few nylon 2 and 4 footers for tethering and rap extension~ especially for new partners who may be less careful to avoid slack (at the anchor) or rope rubbing (on rappel).,Jul 2009,May 28 2020,2
5797,Nylon vs dynex sewn slings/runners. Which do you prefer and for what uses?,1,10, I use double length nylon sling to extend rappel or make a PAS for cleaning. Mostly because its easier to untie an overhand knot or a clove hitch with it~ and if you fell on it while using as a PAS its much safer than dyneema (see this scary DMM video showing 2 foot direct falls on slings). youtube.com/watch?v=SY12o2F…  For alpine draws~ I use mostly dyneema to save weight.,Jul 2013,May 29 2020,1

5800,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,0, Is it a big deal if your toes can touch the front of the liner in a pair of double boots?  I bought a pair of Baruntse's a few months ago~ based on my size in the Nepal line. They fit well after heat-molding the liners~ but I can feel my toes brushing the front of the liner sometimes; if I put the toe of the boot on the floor and give it a good push~ I can't touch the front of the shell~ but I can definitely feel the liner. It is not an uncomfortable pressure but it's there. Is this going to be an issue? I am afraid to go up a half size~ as I have spindly bitch ankles and I already have to strap the upper laces pretty tight to keep my heel in place. I am also afraid to end up with miserable smashed toes - I have ski touring boots for that. ,Oct 2017,May 28 2020,0
5801,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,1, its kinda up to you. i can tell you after wearing double plastics and descending 11k vertical feet in them~ i appreciated having my toes not banging into the front of my boot. however~ there was always some pressure of the liner on my toes but it never bothered me.,Dec 2014,May 28 2020,0
5802,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,2, Your feet can swell after a long day of hiking/climbing and at high altitude. What are you using for socks when your toes touch? Is this walking around your house or after a trial hike? What socks are you planning to wear while climbing? Toe bang against the liner is less consequential than against the front of a single boot but I'd probably still size up. Maybe you should consider a different boot altogether if you can't keep the heel lift reasonably in check? ,Apr 2010,May 28 2020,0
5803,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,3, This is after wearing them around the house for several hours - it’s way too hot to do any sort of trial hike in them in NC/SC until at least November~ I would be pouring sweat out of my boots after every mile.,Oct 2017,May 28 2020,0
5804,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,4, What do you plan on doing with the boots?  Also~ have you tried thinner socks?  I'm a big fan of the thinnest wool socks you can find. Basically~ if you plan on doing lots of ice climbing then it could be an issue.   If you just plan on doing less technical climbing then it could be a non issue.   I fit most of my mountaineering boots tighter than most because I like doing moderate climbing + alpine rock.   Which is a lot of what we have in the cascades here.   I find that if I fit my boots for ice climbing then I tend to have more heel lift when walking just a trade off I guess.,Mar 2008,May 28 2020,0
5805,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,5, How did you heat mold the liners? Did you use a toe cap? Since you molded the liners to your feet~ it makes sense that it’s a close fit~ and should be ok as long you don’t hit the shell. You can always try redoing the heatmolding; I did it twice before I was happy with my baruntses ,Feb 2020,May 28 2020,0
5806,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,6, I used the Intuition toe cap I got with my ski boot liners~ while wearing a wool ski sock instead of the super thin stocking you get with Intuitions - wanted to have some room for foot swelling. I did the ski liner molding trick where you smash your toes into the front of the boot for about 10 seconds before settling in to let the liners cool.  For now~ my intended use is an Ecuador volcano this winter~ plus maybe a winter 14er and possibly a few things in the Northeast. I’m not really into ice climbing~ but I do have a pair of warm singles I can use for that. No toe bang in those. ,Oct 2017,May 28 2020,0
5807,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,7, Did you try a half size up?? Are you using the stock footbed???  I would probably want a bit more room and go up a half size and put in a good foot bed which will help with heal lift.,Jul 2007,May 28 2020,0
5808,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,8, Have you tried a footbed in Baruntse’s? I tried some Superfeet I had laying around~ but the inside of the shell is shaped very much like a footbed already and stacking something else on top of it felt super awkward. Hopefully that makes sense  ,Oct 2017,May 28 2020,0
5809,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,9, I don't use insoles at all in the Baruntse liners FWIW~ not even the factory ones. Just the liners molded to my feet. Does taking the insoles out give you more wiggle room?,Sep 2013,May 28 2020,0

5813,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,13, As a voice of reassurance - I thought my ice boots were too small at first (I could touch my toes to the front walls) but then I changed the socks I used (went from thick merino wool to thin merino wool + vapor barrier - this changed the ability for my heel to nest in the back of the boot) and broke the boots in - and now they are the perfect size if not on the verge of being slightly too big. Ultimately though I think the only way of figuring out if the current boot you have will result in pain and discomfort is by using them and seeing what happens. ,Mar 2014,May 28 2020,0
5814,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,14, I'm still impressed you ski tour with smashed toes?! The joy of ski boots that fit and don't smash your toes is unmatched.,Aug 2011,May 28 2020,0
5815,Double boots sizing and toe bang,1,15, I’m exaggerating a bit~ they’re not completely terrible~ but I can definitely touch the front of the boots if I try. I ended up really miserable once~ when I left the bottom buckles loose while skinning and my feet could slide forward enough to bang toes. ,Oct 2017,May 29 2020,0

I don't carry it on my harness often but if you're on icy and/or wet dirty rock you can definitely yank the hell out of it and feel ok. On soft desert sandstone it'll place well but it'll also leave a dimple in the crack~ just a warning.

5857,New Car Help,1,0," I've finally come to the realization the Impreza might not be cutting it for my needs anymore~ so I'm considering buying something that is. I positively hate the idea of losing $$ purchasing a vehicle and having a car payment~ but here I am. Has anyone else gone through the new car analysis phase recently and care to share your findings? I'll be using it mostly for climbing and mountain biking trips around the west~ but I live in the city. I'm specifically looking for: Good MPG (>30 HW) I drive some long distances on the freeway to get to climbing/biking spots. Long/flat enough to comfortably and easily sleep in without building a platform. I'm 5'10"" and want to be able to sleep on my back. Rough-road capable. Decent ground clearance~ some variety of AWD. Think Phantom Spires~ Needles~ Black Velvet Canyon~ Sierra east side roads. New~ or late model. Easy enough to find/buy. I don't want to search on eBay or craigslist for months to find that perfect 1993 Delica... Price of course is a consideration. I'm definitely not loaded.   So far~ I've got the Subaru Outback and Forester on the list~ as well as the Rav4 and CRV. Anything else that should be there?",Mar 2006,May 17 2020,0
5858,New Car Help,1,1, CR-V is hugely capable. I have a first gen and it is amazing. I have beat it up and taken it on 4wd only trails in s Utah. It's limitations are that the awd system sucks imo. But then again awd always sucks~ it's good for wet and maybe some snow.  I recommend getting a second gen just so you get a timing chain instead of a belt. I think it was not till 3rd gen that they made the seats for an average size person. ,Mar 2013,May 17 2020,4

5863,New Car Help,1,6, Once a motor goes to a timing chain its usually a reliable enough motor that the designer wants to keep around as long as possible.  Yup! My first gen I replaced the belt on at 140k and I expect that engine to last another 100k. Other common issues like AC problems and some rack and pinion leaks are the only other problems I have had.

5864,New Car Help,1,7," Subaru outback and Forester check many of the boxes like you said~ but keep in mind that 2009+ do not have seats that lay flat. There is about a 3 inch bump from cargo area to back of seats. If you want to be comfortable in those cars at ~6' tall you will have to build a platform. Before 2009 the seats lay flat but the cargo area is much shorter. At 6'4"" I would have had to remove my 2008 Forester passenger seat to have a comfortable platform setup. ",Jun 2017,May 17 2020,1
5865,New Car Help,1,8, Last I knew~ the Forrester is built on the Impreza platform~ so same wheelbase. I'd check the bed length carefully. Outback is a few inches longer wheelbase.,Jul 2009,May 17 2020,2

5867,New Car Help,1,10, A big quality in my next vehicle will be seats laying flat. I read in my research somewhere that the 2020 Forester has flat laying seats. May have to wait a bit for those to be more affordable~ though.,Mar 2018,May 17 2020,1
5868,New Car Help,1,11,,Mar 2015,May 17 2020,2
5869,New Car Help,1,12, I'm biased. Toyota Tacoma 4x4 manual transmission. May not get 30mpg but I've got 250~000 miles on my 2006 and is still running strong. only been in the shop once for a leaking timing chain cover. Usual maintenance tho. tires~ brakes~ oil. plus with the Tacoma you can put a shell on it for sleeping and storage. This is my 3rd Tacoma 4x4 and every one I bought new and put 250~000 plus on each and were still running good when I sold the first 2.  My friend who bought my 82 4x4  22 r engine is still driving it and he's put another 300.000 on it.,Apr 2010,May 17 2020,15
5870,New Car Help,1,13, Max~ that's an interesting idea about the lift that I hadn't thought about.  I used to take it to Phantom all the time back in 2014/15 when the road was in better shape and before I added the bike hitch to it. I was just there recently though~ and I definitely wouldn't be comfortable driving the Impreza on it now. One problem is that it has such a bad approach angle~ and now departure angle since I put the bike hitch on. Dwain~ I've been very tempted to go the Tacoma route many times. Still hoping to get that mpg though.,Mar 2006,May 17 2020,0
5871,New Car Help,1,14," FWIW~ I'm 6'3"" and sleep in the back of a 2011 outback regularly for a week or more at a time and it's fine. Seats aren't perfectly flat~ but certainly close to it. The bigger thing is that they aren't level with the wheel base when folded down.  But if you want to sleep head toward the front~ then a couple degrees angling the front of the car downhill gets a flat sleeping surface. Push the front passenger seat forward all the way~ take the head rest off~ and recline it until it's flush with the rear seat. Then toss a pack on the seat~ add something to make a pillow~ and it's good to go. If it's just me in the vehicle~ I just leave it rigged like that.  Window vent shades for moderate temps~ reflectix cut outs for the windows for cold temps~ hatch open if location permits when it's warm. Pretty decent mileage~ not too much pick up but does fine in the 2.5l~ good enough awd and clearance to get me most anywhere I've wanted to go with a little care (dirt roads or snow)~ especially with good tires. Can be a bit of a PITA to work on yourself if that's how you roll.",Jul 2010,May 17 2020,3
5872,New Car Help,1,15, I’ve heard stories of people putting a small diesel engine in a Tacoma and getting 40-50mpg. Course that comes along with a $10-15k price tag and all the other hassles (and some advantages) of a diesel engine.  Tacoma’s are great and super reliable~ but the upfront cost is usually pretty high given they hold their value. That said~ once you have it the cost of ownership is relatively low~ so it partially evens out the gas mileage question if cost is your only metric.  Thought about a Honda Element? I got about 26-28mpg when I drove one~ plenty of room for sleeping (I’m 6’ even)~ and about the same clearance as a Forrester or Outback. Finding them in good condition is getting trickier~ but still possible. The biggest minus for me~ and a big reason I ended up selling mine~ was it didn’t have great low range torque. ,Mar 2012,May 17 2020,2
5873,New Car Help,1,16, Well you could always keep the Impreza and just buy a teardrop trailer to tow. Most Subarus have a max tow capacity of 2000 lbs and a lot of teardrops weigh in the 1500 lb range. Not only do you get an over 6 foot beds~ but you get a built in stove~ fridge etc. ,May 2015,May 17 2020,2
5874,New Car Help,1,17, The 2020 Subaru Outback have rear seats that folds completely flat. It's also probably got the the biggest interior space~ in terms of length~ of any wagon or CUV in it's class.,Jul 2018,May 17 2020,2
5875,New Car Help,1,18," I know that this probably won't change your mind~ nor is this a dis on you just my personal experience. I would just like to say that I'm 6'2"" and can comfortably sleep in my Crosstrek if I put my feet up through the console. You should try that and see if it changes anything. I slept like that for a year on the road. Doesn't fix the clearance issue though sorry. For that I think my crosstalk is great. I have had no road that was short of a full on jeering road it couldn't handle fine. So if you want a touch more room with great gas mileage the outback should be a great option (assuming it off roads the same as a crosstrek which i would assume it would).",Dec 2017,May 17 2020,2
5876,New Car Help,1,19, Thisnis just my experience. The crosstrek is fantastic. I bought a new one for 18 with and extend warrenty. K uabe a payment but its small and the peace of mind of a new vehicle is palpable. It is exceptionally offroad capable for what it is. Black velvet potosi other pretty nasty stuff is no problem. I can sleep.in the back at 6 1. Its tight but doable.  I have been really impressed.  A few small addtions with tires and springs and it would he able to go to clark mnt. I get 35 mpg on the hwy Cons... its slow pretty much it,Dec 2011,May 18 2020,2
5877,New Car Help,1,20, So many climbers want a car with similar attributes. Outback is probably the closest.  I have an Impreza with 170K on it~ but Toyotas are better in terms of long term reliablity. Toyota trucks~ including 4runners~ are some of the best vehicles on the road. And a lot of the car based ones (rav4~ highlander) are great too.  A Tacoma or 4Runner will run forever and get you anywhere. But less mpg and doesn’t handle or ride as well as a crossover (car based). A hybrid highlander (Lexus RX 400h or 450h is the same platform) will get close to 30. A little beefier than a rav4 but seats don’t go flat. The Toyota hybrid drivetrain is awesome. Efficient and long lasting.   For just one person you can go diagonal and make a lot of cars work. For 2 you need something bigger with seats that go flat IMO. If you don’t go in snow you could get a 2wd Tacoma which would still get you to most climbing areas but better mpg~ ride~ handling. Put a shell on the back and two people could sleep comfortably. A crosstrek is an Impreza with extra ground clearance. It’s shorter than an outback so a little better off-road.subies are pretty rugged for a car based suv/wagon. ,Oct 2011,May 18 2020,1
5878,New Car Help,2,0, I have a 2012 Outback~ and I'm 6'7. The seats don't go entirely flat~ but darn close. My brother (6'6) has a 2014 Outback and I think his seats don't go as flat as mine~ but I could just be biased towards my car. When I was researching subaru's~ I found that in 2015 both the Outback and Forester had redesigns that allowed the seats to go flat and extended their length by an inch or two. I think the 2020 redesign further lengthened them again. I found I could just barely fit in the back of a 2020 Forester~ but got the outback because I wanted the extra space. The Outback gets great freeway mileage (28 mpg) but suffers greatly in the city where I usually get around 17 or 18 mpg. If you don't need the extra room~ I think the Forester might be the better bet in terms of mpg. My friend has a crosstrek and it gets great mileage~ but man is it small!,Apr 2016,May 18 2020,1
5879,New Car Help,2,1, A few more to the list - VW Golf Alltrack is slightly lifted wagon~ ground clearance 6.9~ better than Impreza~ AWD Volvo has two X-series wagons~ their ground clearance is a tad under Outback~ AWD Buick Regal TourX is a nice wagon~ AWD~ but the ground clearance is not that great. Subaru Crostrek should come out with 2.5 liter engine for next year. Amusingly~ it gets pretty much the same EPA gas mileage as the 2l engine~ but should be more driveable than the 2l version. Oh yea~ I have Impreza hatch~ I know how wheezy that 2l is. ,Feb 2012,May 18 2020,3
5880,New Car Help,2,2, The Honda Passport has a lot better off-roading than a CR-V or Rav-4~ if you plan to use it for that~ but its quite a bit more expensive. ,Jul 2017,May 18 2020,1
5881,New Car Help,2,3," I have a 2016 Forester - the seats don't go flat however~ I just pad out the lower part with my rope and some other gear and then throw my Exped MegaMat sleeping pad on it and it's fine. In order to sleep at full length I also have to build up the passenger footwell and put the seat all the way forward with the seatback tilted forward. I'm 5'9"". The new Foresters have that engine on/off thing and do better on gas than mine but I have the turbo which is more fun though they don't make anymore. Had to have the transmission valves replaced around 50k~ not sure if that's an individual car issue or more widespread.",Oct 2008,May 18 2020,2
5882,New Car Help,2,4, Nissan Rogue~ Subaru Crosstrek and Honda CRV all have AWD and get 30 mpg~ the Toyota RAV4 gets just under.  I would consider getting something 1 - 2 years old~ probably a lease return with an extended factory warranty.  My last 2 cars were bought like that (OK~ one was my own lease return) and the warranty can be better than the new car one.  Save the biggest chunk of depreciation and get something with low miles. Even if teh seats don't lay flat~ you can get a small air mattress or roll up foam to smooth out the bumps.,Jun 2014,May 18 2020,1
5883,New Car Help,2,5, Thank you all for the thoughtful responses~ a lot of helpful information here. I'm going to look and re-look at each option~ starting from the least expensive first. ,Mar 2006,May 18 2020,0

5888,New Car Help,2,10, 2021 Toyota Sienna minivan is coming~ only hybrid. AWD available. 30+mpg. I had a Sienna in the past when my kid was in a car seat (sliding doors are so good for that). But it was also an awesome road trip vehicle. Tons of room. 3rd row folds into floor so you can camp in it and still have seating for 4-5 if needed. But ground clearance was minimal. Not how the new one will be~ but marketing photos show it out in the boonies.,Oct 2011,May 18 2020,3
5889,New Car Help,2,11, The Outback is the obvious choice if you can find a way to smooth the bump without a platform. It gets 29 mpg combined city/hwy per the EPA estimate. But I have to say that their reputation for reliability seems overblown to me~ everyone I know with a Subie has had a significant problem under the hood at some point. I'll throw in a curve ball: I have a 2003 (edit: 2013 not 2003) Tiguan which is smaller and faster than the current model. It does surprisingly well on rutted dirt roads with occasional rocks~ the entry/exit angles are great. Not high clearance but nothing stupid hanging down either~ better clearance than an Element~ similar to the CRV. The amazing little feature is that the front passenger seat folds totally flat and level with the folded rear seats. This allows one very tall person to sleep comfortably in the back (the driver's seat does not fold flat). Two people with gear would make sleeping in the back very crowded. I get in the low 30's on the highway~ mid 20's around town~ but I have poor driving habits.,Nov 2001,May 18 2020,0
5890,New Car Help,2,12, I'm in a similar boat as the OP. Starting grad school soon away from the Sierra and need a getaway vehicle that also sleeps two. I'm currently starting a spreadsheet to keep track of the relevant features so I can do some data visualization later on perhaps -- will share it here if it turns out interesting. Still in the early phase of research but Rav4 Hybrid is near the top of the list for me. Subarus are as well but they seem to see a lot of shop time and fuel economy isn't great but improving the last couple years (I think?). If anyone fancies an efficient diesel van~ I am selling a 94 HiAce Super Custom Turbo All-time 4WD in NorCal.,Oct 2012,May 18 2020,1
5891,New Car Help,2,13, Subies are overrated. But it's often because of the head gasket problems (design flaw). My Impreza needed a head gasket at around 100~000 miles. $1~200 fix. I almost got rid of it~ but I'm glad I didn't. It's at 170~000 and runs great~ it's had no other problems. I have friends with Subies with well over 200~000 still working good (but many needed some major repairs). ,Oct 2011,May 18 2020,3
5892,New Car Help,2,14, I have an 03 Impreza Outback that I put Forester struts on. Gave me a much appreciated extra 2” . Allowed for bigger tires~ and helps a ton in the snow and off road. I’m not quite 6’ and still have to sleep diagonally in the back tho.  I’ve had the same question as the OP ever since I hit 200k,Nov 2016,May 18 2020,1
5893,New Car Help,2,15, Just a reminder that everything is a trade off. Lift the car and put bigger tires on and your mpg goes down~ and likely it will handle worse on the road. The trick is finding a good compromise for what you want. I'm married and we have a multiple car strategy which is nice. I recently got a Plug in Prius with only 27~000 miles for $16~000. I'm getting 73 mpg (varies depending on how many miles are electric vs. gas but will get about 50 if all gas). Plenty of room for 4. But of course terrible off road. and the back seat doesn't go flat~ although one person can sleep in it. I have the Suby for moderate off road and snow. And a big truck that only gets used when it's needed.,Oct 2011,May 18 2020,1

It's not clear exactly how they collect their data and who pays for the web site. It looks like a snapshot taken when a car is turned into an auction house~ but may not reflect problems over the life of the car. It is funny how every manufacturer has reliable and unreliable models~ Jeep being the most extreme! VW has never been great on reliability overall~ but I have luckily avoided the bad model/years on my three VW's and never had a major problem. I buy them more because I enjoy driving them than for their reliability.,Nov 2001,May 19 2020,2
5895,New Car Help,2,17, If you are only going to be doing some bumpy dirt roads and the vast majority of your miles are going to be on pavement~ the Rav4 or Highlander hybrids are a great option since they get good mpg and will be a lot more comfy going 85mph on the highway. They both still have pretty good ground clearance too. I have dreams of getting a jacked up 4Runner or Tacoma~ but 99.9% of my driving is on pavement and it just doesn't make a lot of sense to get <20mpg (vs 40) just for some off road capability that will barely get used while a Rav4 can get to a lot of the same places~ just not as well. If you really have to get to the last mile of that forest service road in the middle of nowhere to camp in solitude though~ then go for a proper truck. As far as the Outback~ it's a pretty good car~ but the CVT kind of sucks and the 2.5 engine is pretty underpowered for a car that big. You have to jump up to the turbo version to get more hp which is pricey. The Rav4 or Highlander Hybrids have more hp and much better fuel economy. Apparently the CVT in those isn't quite as obnoxious because it has the electric motors to help.,Sep 2011,May 19 2020,2
5896,New Car Help,2,18, My wife and I have a 2011 Tacoma and 2014 Crosstrek.  The tacoma is a great vehicle for these applications but is pricey~ and mine (which is a 4 cylinder) gets about 26mpg in the best case scenario.  A bonus to Tacomas is that there are extensive forum tutorials and how-to videos so you can do just about any maintenance yourself if you were inclined to do so.  I've never slept in the crosstrek though I have a friend with the same car that does is regularly. It routinely gets 33mpg driving mountain roads in the Reno/Tahoe area. It has the same ground clearance as the outback~ but less cargo space.  You would definitely have invest in a rocket box or something for gear storage.  I can comfortably drive it to most established climbing areas.  I wouldn't hesitate to take it to black velvet canyon though I would probably drive it half the speed as the tacoma.  If you hurrying to be first in line on epinephrine it could be an issue.,May 2011,May 19 2020,1
5897,New Car Help,2,19, That is a cool web site~ thanks for posting it! It's not clear exactly how they collect their data and who pays for the web site. It looks like a snapshot taken when a car is turned into an auction house~ but may not reflect problems over the life of the car. It is funny how every manufacturer has reliable and unreliable models~ Jeep being the most extreme! VW has never been great on reliability overall~ but I have luckily avoided the bad model/years on my three VW's and never had a major problem. I buy them more because I enjoy driving them than for their reliability. They take a snapshot when cars are turned into auction houses and dealerships. You're right it may not reflect problems. It's basically just: 1. How many miles are on the car 2. Are there engine issues 3. are there tranny issues? So yes it won't reflect problems over the life of the car. Also cars like Subaru have the head gasket issue~ so probably a lot are traded in when that happens~ so that knocks their score down. But you fix it and they last another 100~000 miles. But it's actually statistically significant information as opposed to the anecdotal evidence you usually get. The biggest takeaway I get from the site is: if Toyota makes the size/type of vehicle I want (e.g. mid size crossover SUV) I'm very likely to buy the Toyota. My anecdotal evidence owning Toyotas and Subaru~ Honda~ VW~ Fords~ Chrysler~ Porsche~ BMW~ confirms that. My Toyotas have all been awesome (Tacoma~ 4Runner~ Sienna~ Prius).,Oct 2011,May 19 2020,1
5898,New Car Help,3,0," Great advice. I shake my head when I see soccer moms driving in full size~ truck based SUVs. Not only are they sucking the gas~ but they are harder to park~ handle worse~ and ride worse. But they don't want to be ""uncool"" driving a minivan which would probably suit their needs a lot better. Thankfully there's a lot more crossover SUVs out now.",Oct 2011,May 19 2020,0
5899,New Car Help,3,1, IMO wagons and minivans are underrated adventure vehicles.,Dec 2014,May 19 2020,3
5900,New Car Help,3,2, I highly suggest a RAV4. I am 6'3 and slept in it for a month with my significant other.  Pretty good gas mileage and have been over some scary winter passes with it with no problem. Also when you take it off pavement it has a really good turn radius so you can pick and choose your line really well when getting rowdy.  When my RAV dies or if it dies I will get another. ,Feb 2015,May 19 2020,2
5901,New Car Help,3,3, I've just read/watched a bunch of comparisons between the Outback~ Forester~ RAV4~ and CRV. It seems that the Subarus are pretty universally accepted as better handling on most surfaces~ albeit underpowered on base models. They also seem to be more utilitarian with cargo space~ and have slightly better mpg (again~ base models). Of course~ Honda and Toyota seem to have Subaru beat on long term ownership/repair costs. The new hybrid RAV4 sounds great~ but starting at 30+k~ it's more than I want to spend. I did look for some used Siennas too~ but the low clearance + length and not great mpg is problematic for me. I'm still waiting to hear back from some shops about just getting a lift on the Impreza. And not that aesthetics are a very high priority to me~ but those Crosstreks sure are sharp looking! ,Mar 2006,May 19 2020,1
5902,New Car Help,3,4, Lifts on Imprezas are pretty straight forward. Depending on year~ get the struts and springs from same year Forester(avoid self leveling rear struts at all cost). or just get spacers all around.,Jul 2018,May 19 2020,1
5903,New Car Help,3,5," I'd recommend looking at a Pontiac Vibe~ it's a very underrated car! Same motor as the Toyota Matrix. Back seats fold down flat and it has a plastic floor~ I can sleep fully stretched out and I'm 6'2"". I have the 6speed FWD~ but you can get an AWD model. Mine gets >30mpg on the highway at 70mph. Clearance isn't nearly what a truck is~ but it's a relatively short wheelbase and approach angle is pretty good. If MPG and reliability are big priorities~ I'd skip the Subaru and go for a Vibe.",Aug 2013,May 20 2020,1

5908,New Car Help,3,10, I know there are trails where you absolutely need a high clearance 4WD vehicle~ but I took my (then) GF''s 2nd generation RAV4 into some really funky country and I drove my Volvo XC60 AWD back past some 4 wheelers who asked how I managed to make it down that road/wash.  It never occurred to a few that you could drive around the rocks and dips.,Jun 2014,May 21 2020,2

5910,New Car Help,3,12, A 2017 Rav4 hybrid version will usually do the same freeway (smaller gas engine makes up for the added weight). And about 11 mpg better city. If all freeway it's not worth the premium up front cost for the hybrid. But as a daily driver you'll have local miles too. Toyota's hybrid system is awesome. The transaxle is great engineering~ simple~ robust~ long lasting~ efficient. I love the efficiency: the gas engine shuts down when not needed~ it regenerates energy when you come to a stop~ etc. My current plug in hybrid is even better. If you go down a long grade (coming down from the mountains) it charges the battery and I get all electric miles from energy that would have otherwise just burned up my brake pads. In mixed driving I get about 63 mpg in my Prius. Getting 73 lately with the shutdown and more local driving. with The plug in Rav4 should be awesome. Like Eric I'll wait until I can get a used one in a few years. The suggestion of a Vibe is good. It's a Toyota with Pontiac badging. But maybe hard to find one with low miles~ especially  with AWD. Another option I've see is a Transit Connect van. Good small camper conversion. But not much clearance. I've had the same thing where people at a hot springs by Bishop were asking me how I got my Prius down the rough road. Got to place your tires in the best spots and take the humps diagonally.,Oct 2011,May 21 2020,1

I don't think I can justify two separate vehicles currently.

I believe it will not lose any cargo space and you qualify for the Federal Tax Credit (assuming you have enough tax liability for the full credit - it is $7500). Additionally you get $1~000 back from CA with a rebate~ and potentially your local electric utility will also offer a rebate.,Oct 2010,May 21 2020,2

5917,New Car Help,3,19, I also would never buy a new $50~000 SUV (even a Jeep Wrangler) and do any serious off road in it. Any real off road is going to beat on it.

And the Suby would be way nicer to drive on the road. ,Oct 2011,May 21 2020,0
5918,New Car Help,4,0, I'm in the one car situation for now. I do see how 2 vehicles can work nicely but don't have the parking for that. Does anyone have any experience with one of the older toyota highlander hybrids (pre-2008)? Ideally I would find an efficient car with 4WD not AWD~ but it seems like AWD is the name of the game now. Most people (namely myself) need 4WD only a small fraction of the time.,Oct 2012,May 26 2020,0
5919,New Car Help,4,1," Outback is truly the best bet.  Hard to find that combination of reliability~ space (I'm 5'9"" and find sleeping in mine to be super comfortable)~ MPG~ off-road capability~ price~ etc.  Plus  with a hitch and/or roof box you can fit TONS of gear.  ",Jul 2008,May 26 2020,1
5920,New Car Help,4,2, I've driven the 2nd generation highlander 08-12 and was impressed. They get more interior room and more refined and better looking with each generation but even the 1st generation are reliable. I've seen some great deals on the first generation but to me it would be worth it to spend more and get the 2nd gen. Hard to find used hyrids though~ at least around here. Lexus RX400h and RX450h are same platform as respective year Highlander Hybrids~ sometimes easier to find. Usually 4WD means truck based. Heavy. Less efficient. But better off road~ more rugged~ and better for towing. AWD usually means car based. Often the rear wheels automatically kick in when the front wheels start slipping. Except Suby which is full time AWD. Clearance is more important than 4WD/AWD for rough roads to climbing spots~ AWD/4WD is great for the snow.,Oct 2011,May 26 2020,0
5921,New Car Help,4,3, Opinions on using Outback/Highlander/Rav4 or similar for extended trips?

5922,New Car Help,4,4, I've slept in a 2013 Outback and found that for one person sub 6` it would probably be fine for longer trips. With two people there tends to be more shuffling than I personally find okay when you're on the road for longer periods. Maybe just me but day after day of setting up and taking down the sleeping area so you can cook~ relax~ etc~ becomes annoying. I don't think an outback would be great with a platform setup for underbed storage~ but maybe the Highlander or even Rav4 would allow for it given a slightly higher ceiling height?,Oct 2012,May 27 2020,0

5926,New Car Help,4,8, Agree with Derek.  Many long 2 person trips with a couple of Outbacks mandated a well positioned roof box (so you can open the back) and a hitch tray to carry bins as well to minimize interior shuffling.  Like Derek said~  a more streamlined approach to activities Helps.   Now I put the same box and tray on my F-150 and Can fully indulge all my ADD tendencies,Jun 2013,May 27 2020,0
5927,New Car Help,4,9, The perfect rig is fundamentally impossible- On the one hand you want spacious (for gear & sleeping) as well as lifted & 4x4/AWD. On the other hand you want compact & low for good mpg~ comfortable ride~ easy parking~ and stealth. Therefore the right answer will depend on what you do most. If you mainly drive to a trailhead the night before and nap before an early rise~ then a hatchback is great. It seems like @Brandon R may be that type of user~ for which Outback/RAV4/Highlander are great. I eventually went to a small teardrop trailer for long 2 person trips. You can tow them with a hatchback~ which gives you a lot of flexibility~ and when you aren't on a road trip you have a regular car. The biggest downsides are probably expense & parking. On the bright side we get as much as 26mpg.,Jul 2013,May 28 2020,0
5928,New Car Help,4,10, I had a Ford Explorer with an adjustable suspension. Their implementation sucked but it's a good concept. The Tesla Cybertruck will probably do it right where it's low and handles well on the road but cranks up for off road. Another big drawback of a trailer is how fast you can go (legally as well as safely). In California there is a statewide speed limit of 55 mph for towing. A CHP friend told me that as long as you're not speeding they don't ticket you for say 65 in a 65 zone. Also need to be aware of increased stopping distances~ less maneuverability~ etc. As mentioned though it gives you a lot of flexibility. I guess as mentioned for two cars~ you have to have somewhere to store the trailer.,Oct 2011,May 28 2020,0

5935,New Car Help,4,17, Coincidentally I’ve just been kicking that rooftop tent idea around.   Other than they’re freakin expensive~ one key drawback for me is also the pack-up/takedown when you need to move/use your vehicle.

Unfortunately it is mostly mountaineering/summitting/peak bagger stuff. Honestly the rock quality in the park really sucks and there is not a whole lot of technical rock climbing. Look up David Steele and Jason Mills. They have put up a few routes in the park over the last few years. In the winter the park is a mecca for ice. Big Sky Ice has a handful of the park's routes. Beyond that start combing through previous AAJs. Past those avenues~ word of mouth is the best resource. ",Aug 2014,May 28 2020,1

5962,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,6, Anyone else try their new mk2?,Feb 2017,May 26 2020,0
5963,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,7, It’s great. Over all is kind of a simple board~ but that’s also why I like it. Not much to add on top of what others said. I think the off set holds are nice on my shoulders. One feature that hasn’t been mentioned is that the board holds a phone on the pull up rung. Makes it easier to watch time etc. Got mine mid March and have been using it since the gyms closed. No complaints. Tension Climbing had great customer service too. I got my board in a timely matter. That was nice considering the circumstances. All the best and good luck!,Sep 2012,May 26 2020,1
5964,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,8, How does it compare to a Beastmaker~ if you’ve used one before?,Feb 2017,May 26 2020,0
5965,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,9, Just doing simple exercises at the BRC I have used there beastmakers but nothing extensive. So unfortunately I can’t really say. I’m kinda a hangboard noob so I might not be very helpful. Didnt really have to use a hangboard much When gyms were easily accessible. For what it’s worth edges are rounded and easy on the skin~ but can’t say I know enough about the beastmaker to compare.,Sep 2012,May 26 2020,2
5966,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,10, I recently bought a hangboard from TahoeClimbingSupply on Etsy. Someone posted on SoCal facebook climbing page and said their relative (possibly dad) was making hangboards and selling it online. I bought the $125 and $60 portable version and love em. Id suggest supporting small local shopsetsy.com/shop/TahoeClimbing…,Mar 2010,May 26 2020,0
5967,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,11, I own the Tension Grindstone MKII and used a Beastmaker 2000 at the gym. Both are good~ I like the Tension’s asymmetrical design which is nicer for the shoulders.The Tension doesn’t have any unnecessary fluff like pockets (you can just hang off the same holds with less fingers). Unlike the Beastmaker~ there are no slopers - though I believe slopers are best trained apart from the hangboard anyway.The various sizes are nicely varied for warmups to good training sizes and tough 8mm edge which kind of reminds me of a less sharp and aggressive Eva Lopez Transgression board.,Mar 2020,May 26 2020,0
5968,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,12, Dope.  I like the BM1k because it has nice holds but some are too narrow and the pockets let you cheat.  Looking forward to the MK2 (placed an order yesterday).   Curious - how do you train slopers outside of hangboard other than climbing slopers?,Feb 2017,May 27 2020,0
5969,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,13, Slopers are about friction~ surface area~ body tension and wrist strength.,Mar 2020,May 27 2020,1
5970,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,14, I agree~ but how do you train for for that? Individually? Maybe it's because slopers are a weak link for me~ but I improve the most (longer/more hangs and more weight added) using the sloper holds on the RP board and any other hold (open/half-crimp). Maybe that is building wrist strength quickly~ but whatever it is training~ it works. Although I don't know if this translates to most real climbing.,Aug 2019,May 28 2020,0
5971,hangboard - soft rounded edges,1,15, You obviously can’t “train” more surface area and friction~ it’s about perfecting technique to stay low below the sloper and finding proper placement of the hand to maximize surface area. I think technique is best achieved through climbing volume.Body tension requires core~ so general core fitness training will help. While I’m sure that hanging off a sloper will train wrists to a certain extent~ I think that time is better spent using weights and doing wrist curls and lock offs. You can also do wrist lock offs on a pull-up bar or gymnastic rings with a weight assisted pulley.,Mar 2020,May 28 2020,0
5972,heated socks? for ice climbing and skiing,1,0, Has anyone had experience with heated socks for ice climbing and skiing?  My toes typically get cold to the point of numbness with my Nepal Extremes when ice climbing. Yes~ they are old boots but this has been the case for years. Recently tried toe warmers and they help~ but only sometimes. When skiing with my Scarpa TX Pros~ my toes are done within a few hours~ resort or backcountry it doesn't seem to make a difference. Some of this could be boot fit issues and I'm going to take a run at making a little more room for my toes~ but I've never been able to stay warm in a ski boot. I'm interested in heated socks in part because I didn't know they existed until the other day~ and in part because thinking these could maybe work with both of my cold weather pursuits (?). I use custom insoles~ so hotronics are not as appealing.  Thanks for any thoughts and experiences.  FWIW~ these are the most informative recent threads on electronics for cold feet I've seen~ but neither mentions socks as an options. https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/111423638/boot-heaters-or-heated-insoles-for-ice-climbing?page=2https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/113993002/dynafit-tlt6-and-cold-temperatures#ForumMessage-114004256,Dec 2015,Feb 2 2019,0
5973,heated socks? for ice climbing and skiing,1,1, Got a pair for my girlfriend this year and they are a game changer. I asked a lot of friends from ski patrol to guides and all of them said the same brand. Lenz. Expensive but heated toe cap and so far worth it.

5977,Metolius magnum crash pad,1,0, Just wondering if anybody used metolius magnum crash pas as a bed as well~ comfy enough for several nights? Also looking at the mad rock triple. They both would fit perfectly in my van Thanks,Dec 2019,May 28 2020,0
5978,Metolius magnum crash pad,1,1, I've used an Organic and a Metolious crash pad as a bed before. The mistake I made was lying on them comfortably for less than five minutes then assuming I would be comfortable all night. I was wrong~ and I found out I can't sleep directly on a crash pad. I recommend using the pads as a base~ then putting a sleeping pad over them. ,Mar 2015,May 28 2020,0
5979,Metolius magnum crash pad,1,2, I would recommend a softer foam on top of the pad~ whenever I sleep on mine without more foam I wake up often and switch sides a lot. It also keeps your body oils off the pad.,Dec 2013,May 28 2020,0

I'm putting up a wall in my garage and am leaning toward the 2019 as it has the same hold sets as the 2016 plus three additional wood hold sets.

5982,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,1, I was gonna say my cast iron for the same reason... Just eat it up and wipe it with a paper towel!  Other than that~ a camp chair has been real nice to have. I got a weird rei backpacking one thrown in with my van and thought I'd never use it~ but it's nice to be able to comfortably sit somewhere. When it inevitably gets a big enough hole burned through it or gets stolen~ I'm definitely upgrading to one of those old school aluminum framed chairs.,Feb 2018,May 19 2020,2

5987,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,6, Small folding table and lawn chair. Thought it seemed kind extra~ since they were such large items~ but it was such a godsend to drive to an actual campsite once in a while~ set up shop~ and cook an actual meal and sit in a chair.,Mar 2019,May 19 2020,1
5988,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,7,  I have a roll-up table that takes very little space. Leo is right it was a god send in the middle of nowhere to be able to set a table up & sort out myself and have an easy meal. I was rarely at campsites so the table was really needed.,Feb 2013,May 19 2020,2
5989,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,8, Food serving trays like you find in a cafeteria or fast food places.  I've got three in my van.  Great for cutting veggies on or serving snacks or just general food prep.  I've got a smaller van (by today's standards) and counter top space is a premium~ the trays really help to solve that problem.,Jun 2014,May 19 2020,29

5997,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,16, Leveling blocks are awfully nice. After years of finding rocks to shim up the vehicle with the leveling blocks are quick and easy. Also a washcloth and some warm water is a quick way to wash off the grime and dries quicker than a big towel,Jan 2008,May 19 2020,4
5998,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,17, They can be expensive~ but a good external battery to charge phones and electronics. You don’t have to worry about waking up with your cell phone at 1% battery when it’s cold out.  A larger propane tank can save a ton of money compared to using the small green ones. Also if you use a cast iron~ a cleaning chain~ which looks like a little chain mail~ so you don’t have to scrape it out with a fork all the time.  And also paper towels. ,May 2017,May 19 2020,1

6000,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,19, So I am contingency planning in the event that I am caught up in the next round of layoffs at my work and go bankrupt via student loan debt (forcing me to move into my truck which is an Fj Cruiser) I have a few questions for MP - most importantly - how do you secure your valuables from trail head thieves? I have over 10k of climbing gear that cannot get stolen and much of which I will not be using while I am out climbing on a given day. I was thinking of bolting some kind of strongbox inside my truck (no open bed on an fj) and storing my most valuable equipment in there. The assumption would be that your average meth head would be unable to break into it. I would need to fit things like ice screws~ crampons~ ice tools~ cams~ portaledge~ bags~ etc. What do you folks do to deal with this problem?,Mar 2014,May 19 2020,4
6001,Car-Dwelling Essentials,1,20, You've seen most of my setup for my CRV. No~ I've not lived in it for months~ but I have for weeks. I second the inflatable solar lantern. Invest in a container that's tight enough to keep everything out of your food (snaps tight). I have an ancient metal cooler thats rodent proof. Ways to cover your windows~ I just use a towel~ but that's awkward. The extra~ blown~ thrift store sleeping bag has been great~ both to keep from freezing but also it can be stuffed in to fill space anywhere you want.  A lot of places are pack out trash now~ so think about garbage. Really heavy duty garbage bags are good for wet stuff. The light plastic things tend to blow away or break. Also~ have some line to string things up if you do have a spot with trees. Best~ Helen,Aug 2015,May 19 2020,2

6010,Car-Dwelling Essentials,2,8, Yes that's bad! But if it works for you then it's all good. You should have a layer of oil between the Iron & the food you are going to eat. Also it will cook more evenly. Cast Iron does not heat evenly & the seasoning helps it even out. Renters ins. is a must. I locked the back of my truck with padlocks ~ so they stole the whole truck! My next step when I got it back was to do away with the ignition key & make my own off on switch that went with me when I left the truck. ,Feb 2013,May 19 2020,2

6015,Car-Dwelling Essentials,2,13, Insurance is weird sometimes. My neighbor had an ATV catch fire~ burning up it~ and the pickup it was in. Almost caught the house on fire~ as it was parked next to his house. Homeowners didn't want to cover~ because it involved his own vehicle (not someone else on his property)~ and it wasn't a house fire.  Auto insurance didn't want to cover it~ because it wasn't his almost new pickup that caught fire. ATV company didn't want any responsibility~ even though this was a known defect ... Catch 22s~ lots of them. Best~ Helen,Aug 2015,May 19 2020,2
6016,Car-Dwelling Essentials,2,14, I would agree that a two-burner stove and rotomolded cooler (like a yeti or equivalent) are game-changers. You can then cook and store real food rather than just eating camping food all the time. Put some block ice in the cooler and you can usually go for about a week without needing more ice.  Not sure about needing an actual residence for renter's insurance.  I bundled mine with my car insurance and it is pretty cheap for $15~000 - 20~000 worth of coverage. ,May 2011,May 19 2020,0

6023,Car-Dwelling Essentials,3,1, My strategy is to make sure valuables are out of site~ but people can see in the car. Meaning if you cover the windows~ thieves will think you're hiding something valuable inside and break in. So leave the interior visible. Anything valuable is hidden away~ e.g. a pack of climbing gear is hidden under a old crappy duffel bag with the top open and just your street clothes showing. You can't hide everything~ so make sure the stuff that's visible is the stuff that's not really worth stealing. I'd consider adding a lock box for really valuable stuff~ but again I'd put something over the lock box to cover it up~ otherwise thieves will think there's something valuable in there and break in. Even if they can't get into the lock-box they may break your windows and steal other stuff. Renter's insurance is a good idea. Document everything with pictures and get a low deductible. A roof box is a great way to free up space in the interior of the car~ but are easy to break into. During the day I put my light bedding and other not so valuable stuff up there. At night you could put a lot of stuff up there to get it out of the way and since you are in the car hopefully no one would be breaking into it.,Oct 2011,May 19 2020,0

6026,Car-Dwelling Essentials,3,4, My experience with car break-ins is that the perps either 1) steal the vehicle or 2) smash~ grab stuff~ & run.  The strong box won't help with 1); maybe a steering wheel lock/club instead~ especially if your vehicle doesn't have modern RF-ID ignition interlocks.  If all your stuff is in neat duffle bags~ it is convenient to take. If you leave all your stuff loose in the vehicle~ it is tedious and time consuming to remove; the resulting chaos might not be convenient to live in.  You can easily run steel cable through most climbing gear and padlock the cable(s) down to seats or child-seat connection points. A downside~ this makes adding that extra cam from lock-up to your rack at the last minute into a tedious chore.  Pacsafe makes an eco-mesh steel cable pack/duffle protector (pacsafe.com/products/120l-a…;_sid=ec9cfada3&_ss=r).,Nov 2010,May 19 2020,0

But with different company~ I take on the rituals of others. (and sometimes it's best to get business done before hitting the trail~ and that may take a cup or two) We had a GSI Outdoors Java Mill.

6062,Car-Dwelling Essentials,5,0, I was a bit hesitant to spend money on a cooler~ so I took the middle road and got a pseudo-rotomolded one from Walmart for $75 (Lifetime 28q). I now see why people spend money on coolers. We stashed IPA's~ dill pickles and ice cream sandwiches at the top of a popular granite route in the area and enjoyed a crisp post-send feast after 1700' feet of handjams in the sun. It also makes for a nice stove platform for the back of my hatchback or on the ground if the site doesn't have a picnic table. Still deliberating on whether to get a table or not.

6064,Car-Dwelling Essentials,5,2, Hit it with a coat of  black spray paint and leave it out in the sun all day while you're out climbing~ and you'll have warm/hot water at the end of the day. Black paint is not really needed. An ordinary old 1/2 gallon juice bottle with water placed in your windshield (parked facing south or west) can reach impressive water temps. Today was 66F and full-on sun in my secret climbing location and the water was too hot for washing my hands~ so I had to dillute it with some cold water. I haven't tried boiling eggs this way~ but I wouldn't be surprised if it works (at least in the desert). Bananas (with optional induced chocolate or brown sugar/cinnamon mix) wrapped in aluminum foil in the windshield makes delicious fried bananas at the end of a day climbing. Should work excellent to heat up burritos or a can of beans too.,Jun 2010,May 26 2020,4
6065,Car-Dwelling Essentials,5,3, I had a soft plastic collapsible jug and it sucked. As soon as it got partly emptied it wouldn't hold it's shape and would try to roll around or droop off the table. Then it sprung a leak and soaked the inside of my car.,Mar 2019,May 26 2020,0

6068,Car-Dwelling Essentials,5,6, I use a small cheap cooler for produce and stuff. Pro tip: putting ice directly in the cooler sucks. Everything gets soaking wet and you have to take everything out to dump the water. Put ice in a nalgene instead~ and put it on a paper towel or something to absorb the condensation. Bonus: you can fill the nalgene with ice for free in loads of places: gas stations~ restaurants~ the subway inside Walmart~ etc That said~ you have to refill the ice pretty frequently. An electric fridge would be a big step up. No experience there though so I can't comment on which one to get.,Mar 2019,May 26 2020,6

6079,Car-Dwelling Essentials,5,17," Ziplock freezer bags. Much sturdier than storage type things~ and will hold liquids. Put your stuff in them and it won't matter if it is in water from ice. Throw that blown sleeping bag over whatever your perishable food is in to shade it. Put the cooler (and the insulation) in the shade if you're camped somewhere.  I like having water in metal refillable things~ and lots of them. I stick one in each cupholder. Something is always in reach then. Pitch the empties to one back corner~ then fill everything at once. I have a skinny hard sided thing for water and a collapsible one. Either fit okay in the foot well on the passenger side~ but 5 gallons is a PITA to pack very far if it's full. Super nice to park in camp though. I worry a little about the collapsible growing algae eventually~ especially since it won't have chlorinated water in it at places like COR. I haven't used it much yet~ though. I like having the cooking stuff all organized into a tub with a really secure lid~ then that~ the cooler (an antique metal Coleman) and other chipmunk/ant proof stuff can all haul out at camp and make room for people and packs in the Honda. I also have a small tub with dedicated washing stuff in it. About the size of a shoebox. That way~ wayward liquid soap won't matter. Remember pressure changes from altitude and/or freezing~ for liquids!  I have the Honda pretty dialed too~ inside. Stuff is always packed in the same places on the same sides. Anything that doesn't need to be accessed gets stuffed down in the space under the seats when their folded down.  I have a book bag type pack with lots of pockets that holds clothes~ toiletries~ etc. Think about things like glasses~ and a book~ by your ""bedside"" at night. I like the phone close by too.  Oh~ get some tape or something to cover the stupid red light that flashes all the time if your Honda's new enough for it. So annoying.  I'm not living full time in there~ but I could easily do months~ if I wanted. Having everything organized also means it's easy to grab and go on almost no notice. I can (and have) shut down the house and been rolling in less than an hour. That includes filling all the water~ loading the car for myself and passengers (with loaner camping equipment of mine sometimes)~ and getting the cats rounded up and situated to forage in the house.

6082,Car-Dwelling Essentials,6,0," Another cooler trick: I've found that the coolest place in my vehicle is the rear seat foot area. Put your cooler there ""stationary"" and don't haul it in and out of the car. Fruits and veggies can last for more than a week in this area even in the desert without added ice. If you have bottles/nalgenes of ice in the cooler and the nights are chilly~ put your ""ice containers"" out at night (but remember to wake up before it gets warm).",Jun 2010,May 26 2020,1

6088,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,0, Ive owned Spot Trackers ~ACR EPIRBs~ and as of 3 years ago  the  Garmins in Reach series. IMO Garmin was very expensive~ difficult to use~ and had a unfavorable  pricing / use schedule. Im wondering if its just me.... what the communities experience been w Garmin -  In Reach?  What do you think of the weight~ features~functionality ~ design~ button layout~  operability~ pricing etc.Look forward to your insight.  ,Sep 2006,Sep 5 2019,0
6089,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,1," I have an Inreach Mini. Love it. Low weight. Durable. Pre-programmed messages ie. ""Safely in camp"" or ""I'm running late. Don't worry"" are easy to send from the mini itself. Longer messages easy to type using phone and bluetooth. Sent my wife a nice good-night message from the confines of my bivy bag recently using BT and my phone when the mini itself was 20 feet away in my pack. I think my monthly subscription is $11 or $12 per month. Can't see that as expensive by any means. ",Jan 2016,Sep 5 2019,15
6090,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,2," I have the Explorer+ and think it is a great device. Except for typing messages on that keyboard. They are now offering the 66i series device (even more expensive and one ounce heavier than the Explorer+)~ which offers a ""virtual keyboard."" I am considering this new device. Although these devices are expensive~ they are cheaper and lighter than sat phones. Worth the peace of mind to have this two-way messaging where no cell signal is available. Edit: I don't carry my cell phone into the backcountry~ nor do I want to. If I did~ the Mini makes sense. Edit #2: Just spoke with Garmin.

6092,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,4, I've had one for over a yr now~ spot before that~ i bring it with me every time we got out. I've got one of the plans that allows me to shut it off during months I don't think I'm going need or use it. the mini came out after i got mine.  I don't think i have ever really used the buttons on the device~ I typically Bluetooth to it and use my phone and device is just hanging on the back of my pack.  If my phone dies then i can still send/receive via device~ so that would stop me from going with the mini  The ability to send basic text updates is worth it to me.  Having listened to most of the episodes of Sharp end podcast the ability to communicate with SAR always seems to be the common theme that everyone wished they had or relished having~ so again worth the cost. As we used to say in the Army when someone questioned the high cost of bandwidth or something else - It's cheaper than a funeral...,Jul 2015,Sep 5 2019,6
6093,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,5," I first started with an ACR PLB but after a couple trips realized how valuable the ""I'm ok"" pings and 2-way communication is in case of an emergency. I have been using the InReach Explorer+ for over a year and liked it so much I sold it and bought a mini last week. I never used the Explorer+ for anything other than a messenger~ weather updates~ and emergency beacon (never used thankfully) so it always stayed off 99% of the time so battery life was never an issue and decided to shed the weight since I didn't need the screen and beefy batery. My phone is my primary GPS device (backcountry navigator) with a paper map backup. No need for 2 GPS devices. I agree with everything Señor Arroz said above so I'll just add that if any of you are ever towing along little ones in the backcountry ""peace of mind"" for the grandparents~ spouses and other family members is a huge plus. Being able to check-in with ""I'm ok"" or ""Running late~ I'm ok"" and your GPS coords really helps ease the worry of loved ones. To me~ if I can get out at least once a month recreating where there's no cell coverage~ the subscription is worth it to me. It's my most valuable subscrition service. I think of it as the price of admission.",Jan 2017,Sep 5 2019,4
6094,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,6, I have an inReach Mini~ it is a reasonably hard product but was surprisingly hard to set up.  It required a couple calls to Garmin customer support to set it up.  It also has quite a few usability quirks that the previous model didn't have.  All around~ IMO it's still best in class~ which is an unfortunately low bar.,Mar 2016,Sep 5 2019,1
6095,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,7, Another vote for the inReach Mini. Was super easy to set up and has been a pleasure to use. It's been a game changer for me to be able to have a back and forth text exchange with my wife as needed when I'm out on an adventure.

6097,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,9, I’ll add to inReach love. I use the option to turn on or off per month. A bit more money but $30-40 per year is cheap for the backup. I have an explorer+ and found the  ability to send from the device useful even though my phone was primary. I will say I mostly used my phone via Bluetooth. I really appreciated having it up outside Jackson~ WY last month where I noticed my phones gps wasn’t always accurate. The gps tracks feature helped a ton on a BC ATV adventure way off grid where I could see my entire route thus far. Helped with orientation. Every outfitter there said that’s what they use with clients as well. ,Jun 2006,Sep 5 2019,0
6098,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,10, FWIW~ you can send messages from the Mini without a phone. Neither the Mini nor the Explorer Plus excels at message input without bluetoothing a phone to it~ anyway. But it's possible. ,Jan 2016,Sep 5 2019,1
6099,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,1,11," Inreach love +1.  The app is awesome for texting your loved ones. plus you can use the map on your phone and mark way points~ and what not and it will transfer to the inreach. Very quick on a qwerty vs the interface on the gps~ but not impossible. Also you can make up messages that you don't have to type out. I had them when I didn't want to bring a phone such like  ""we're okay everything is going great!"" ""Something happened but we're okay~ not sure what we'll do next. this is not an emergency"" ""This is an actual emergency but we are okay and will talk to you when we reach civilization"" ""we are not okay. help is on the way""  Those were nice because my family came to understand exactly what they meant.  I love it. I haven't charged mine in like 2 years and i took it out the other day and it was 96% battery and doing just fine. The battery is great. I use the month to month plan meaning it's like $25 a year (which is much less than i spend on hummus and this is way more important than hummus) then it's like $20-$30 a month when i need it so I think it's very much worth the money. as for pricing~ look on ebay/used gear sites. that's where i got mine (for $200) and I will never need anything else as long as Garmin keeps supporting it.   ",May 2019,Sep 5 2019,2

Yes it has a tracking mode.  Depending on your plan you can have 2~ 10~ 20~ 30 minutes~ 1~ 2 or 4 hours updates.  I think location updates do count against your usage caps.  They also have a location ping where someone can request a location update from the garmin web page.   The weather forecasts are very lame at least in my part of the world.  They do not give you expect high and low but expected temperature at 3 hours (premium forecast) and 12 hours (not premium forecast).  ,Feb 2006,Sep 6 2019,0

6127,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,2,18, I have an inreach mini and can certainly imagine a better device.   The software (earthmate) and firmware in the device are both buggy.  Worse yet I don't get the feeling from garmin that they are putting effort into fixing the problems. The main problem is that sometimes the inreach mini receives a message but the message does not transfer to the earthmate so you cannot read it on your phone or even know you got a message unless you happen to hear the chime on the inreach or look at the inreach display and notice that it indicates you have an unread message.  I think this happens if you are actively using another app when the message arrives (gmail in my case).  There is no way to force earthmate to pull all the messages from a device; which it should do every time you start earthmate but does not. To compound the issue above~ sometimes the only way to mark a message as read on the inreach device is to delete the conversation thread.  So you almost always have a indicator of an unread message even if you have read the message on the device.   One of my contacts who prefers email to text messages had problems replying to a message via the web interface.  Sadly this was the pick me up message.  To make sure he got the message because I never got a confirmation from him that I would get picked up~ I sent a message to several others to make sure he got the message and we were going to be picked up at the desired location which caused quite stir.  (:  I suspect this was user error on his part but I am not certain. Fairly often I receive the same message several times.  It should have a message sequence number and know that it has already delivered the message to me~ or it could compare the message to the previous received messages to determine if I have seen it already. While not a bug per se~ the phone numbers and email addresses counts against the character count of the message.  It only takes a few people is a group message to reduce the message length to 0.   I don't get anything near the advertised battery life.  I get about 3-4 days without tracking; that advertising literature says 20 days with 30 minute track intervals.  Now I only turn in on for an hour in the morning and evening to receive messages and I also turn it on when I need to send a message.   It can take it a long time to get a GPS fix to send with the message~ sometimes an hour or more.  My phone's GPS receiver is much much better. Sometimes there are fairly long system delays delivering a message which does not surprise me given that you must have satellite visibility so send a message; but I am not convinced that is the problem. If someone sends you a MMS message (say a photo with a comment) the whole message is silently dropped~ not just the photo. All that said~ it is a useful device but a better device is easy to imagine.  It would be really great to send and receive MMS message (pictures).,Feb 2006,Nov 12 2019,0
6128,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,2,19," Thanks Pat for that thoughtful criticism. Can you link to where it says 20 days? All I can find on their site is ""Internal~ rechargeable lithium battery provides up to 90 hours of battery life in 10-minute tracking mode"" and ""It includes an internal~ rechargeable lithium battery for up to 50 hours use at the default 10-minute tracking mode and up to 20 days in power saving mode"".  But nowhere in the manual is there instructions for a power saving mode!  The fact that they cite 2 different numbers for the same setting is not confidence inspiring. I will say that MMS would be unrealistic from a data POV~ photos use thousands of times more bandwidth than a text message. A text is the equivalent to a photo of less than 15 pixels square!",Sep 2019,Nov 12 2019,0
6129,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,3,0, Like you I am unable to find any power save mode.  Here is the battery chart from garmin.  I suspect they mean you can get 20 days if you turn off bluetooth.  However they ought to just say that.  Another page says something about ANT+ and bluetooth but my inreach does not have any controls over that either.  I can turn bluetooth off but that makes the device much less useful. As for MMS~ I agree an actual MMS with a photo will take too much bandwidth~ but silently dropping a MMS message is irresponsible.  They should pass along any text in a MMS message and if there is no text but just a picture or video then they should send a message saying someone tried to send a MMS message.  They should send a message to both parties saying that MMS is not supported.   www8.garmin.com/manuals/web…,Feb 2006,Nov 12 2019,0

6139,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,3,10, Pat~ that's fascinating. How relevant is it to texting?

6140,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,3,11, You are right~ it only takes a second or so to send or receive a message so a brief window will suffice. So the satellite could fly between 2 peaks and receive the message but not be visible between the peaks long enough for a call.  This scenario could also induce multiple copies of the same message.  The satellite sends the text message to the inreach and goes behind the second peak before receiving the acknowledgement.  Then the satellite would send the same message again the next time it sees the inreach.,Feb 2006,Nov 12 2019,0

I've found my Inreach to be super helpful there to let friends know we were running late~ etc.  I am guessing you used an Iridium phone as that is the most common and commonly available satellite phone.  I am a little surprised that it was that bad~ but Iridium coverage gets worse the closer to the equator you get.  This is because the satellites are in polar orbits with 11 satellites in each of 6 orbital planes.  These planes converge at the poles so you have many satellites(at least 6~ maybe 18) visible at the poles to carry your phone call.  Also polar regions are often flat.  At the equator the satellites are spread across the sky at 30 degree intervals and offset leading/trailing by half a satellite interval.  So you probably have at 3 - 6 satellites theoretically visible but orbit designers think the earth is a smooth surface.  It is pretty easy to get in a situation where the satellites on the horizon are not visible and the satellites need to be about 10 degrees above the horizon to be usable and that would be with a ideal antenna which the one in the phone is not.  The system tries to hand off your call when one satellite is not longer suitable but that depends on there being a satellite to hand off too.  Also the satellite is in view for 7 minutes on an overhead pass; maybe just a few seconds on a pass on the east/west horizon.  ,Feb 2006,Nov 13 2019,1

6144,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,3,15, Another usage tip for Inmarsat phones is to be still while talking on the phone~ I sit down.  The antenna is highly directional and needs to be pointed at the satellite~ even though it looks like the more omni-directional antenna on the Iridium or globalstar phones.

Yes~ I'm just talking convenience. But? I could also see using this sort of ""convenience"" to quietly coordinate with SAR when I'm a mock mission ""victim"". Or friends need  me on the other side of the range to pick them up from their mountaineering trip. Stuff like that~ which needs to be related in a timely manner~ and needs a reply. ",Aug 2015,Nov 15 2019,0

6163,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,4,14, The Iridium constellation isn't going anywhere.  Uncle Sugar made sure of that a few years ago.  Iridium-Next constellation is already going up. Just like INMARSAT - they have already moved on to newer geo-sync constellation GlobalXpress there are some other start ups that may or may not last long but there handsets and services aren't as expensive.  So not a massive loss if it goes under. SAT PAQ is one such example.  cheap sat-based messaging~ but none of the SOS functionality that comes with inReach: https://satpaq.com/~ it used existing geo-synch sats and freq ranges that aren't in use any more.  cool stuff~ but I'll keep my inReach.  But if Somewear goes defunct~ who are you going to buy the specific service for the device and it's proprietary software from?

6168,Garmin -In Reach: Your Experience/  Any better options ?,4,19, Just two coins. I have Explorer +~ it's good for gps functions and I like that it's quite small~ low weight and has a SOS button in case of emergency - gladly~ we haven't used this function yet~ but better be safe than sorry. But as for plans - it's best to start small and keep a few bucks aside for overage charges. My first plan allowed me to send about 20 messages + a fee for anything over~ but gladly I don't use this function too often. Just messaging from time to time to keep my relatives updated that I'm safe (and so they could track my current location - I really like that it's possible to upload my current position). And as for competitors~ I heard that not too long ago Spot released the Spot X which also has many of the same functions as the In-Reach.

Essentially having a Spot Gen3. It's better than nothing but if I'm paying for a system for 2 way communication then why wouldn't I choose the one that has 2 way communication without the cell phone? The ability to have back and forth communication when a rescue is needed is a great thing that can speed the process up. I'd hate to be dependent on a cell phone for that. Screens break easily and could take that away from you. ,May 2017,May 27 2020,0
6173,Unparallel climbing shoes,1,0, How should you go about sizing these if you have no retailers to go try them on. I wear a 42.5 in the scarpa Instinct if that can give anyone a frame of reference. I appreciate any input!,Jun 2017,May 26 2020,0
6174,Unparallel climbing shoes,1,1, I haven't owned a pair of scarpas but they fit exactly or almost the same as 5.10 shoes. they're basically the same thing just different brand and look,Mar 2010,May 26 2020,1

6178,Tenaya Tarifa question,1,0, For those who have worn them~ how much stretch did you get. They're not leather but feel like the softest shoe I've ever touched. Reviews said they're sized big and most reviewers said they got 1.5 to 2 whole sizes below street shoe. I'm a 10 street with Morton's toe and ordered 9. I feel like I should go to a 9.5 but don't want to over do it. My toes are definitely not liking the 9 though. Edit to add: my big toe just touches with a small knuckle up. My 2nd and 3rd toes are the ones screaming.  What say you?,May 2017,May 23 2020,0
6179,Tenaya Tarifa question,1,1, I'm street shoe size 9 with Morton's toe~ size 7.5 in their downturned shoes (Oasi and Tarifa) and 8 in the non (Ra and Tatanka). Generally I find they stretch ~1/4 of a size~ but the Tarifas are a bit unusual because their profile favors narrower feet and they hurt the sides of my feet before the toes. In your case~ perhaps the tarifas are too asymmetrical for your morton's toe?,Sep 2014,May 23 2020,1
6180,Tenaya Tarifa question,1,2, I have fairly narrow feet and my tarifas are a 9 that have probably stretched 1/4 to 1/8 of a size in the 5 years and multiple resoles they’ve gone through. ,Apr 2006,May 23 2020,1
6181,Tenaya Tarifa question,1,3, Thanks. I'll go up another half size. If that doesn't work I'll probably move on in my quest of a good smearing and edging shoe that fits my weird feet. ,May 2017,May 24 2020,0
6182,Tenaya Tarifa question,1,4, I would say keep searching. In my experience with the Tarifa I was hoping to get the best of both worlds with smearing and edging but the shoe seemed to sort of suck at both. I personally felt very unconfident on edges with this shoe and I think it was a bit better at smearing. Overall though it was not durable at all and really just was a disappointment. Can’t really help ya on the sizing issue you’re having  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so I apologize for that! However; if you’re still looking for a good all around shoe (based on last comment) I say go scarpa Instinct easily the best of both worlds there.,Jun 2017,May 26 2020,1

6184,Selling unused rope,1,1, YGD send to me for proper disposal.   on the real~ shelf life for unused soft goods is usually 10 years.  I'm whipping on a 12 year old rope but I only use it in the gym. someones probably willing to buy it and climb on it. ,Jan 2019,May 26 2020,1
6185,Selling unused rope,1,2, Would I climb on my rope~ that I know sat on the shelf unused for 15 years - YES Would I purchase a rope that someone whom I do not know claims to have been in proper storage 15 years - not just NO~ but F___ NO!,Feb 2012,May 26 2020,4
6186,Selling unused rope,1,3, That’s funny. I had the exact same rope in storage for a similar amount of time~ still in the original bag~ never used. I cut it down and use it for a gym rope. The smaller section I use to practice knots~ anchor ideas~ self-rescue stuff while at home. ,Nov 2015,May 26 2020,1
6187,Selling unused rope,1,4, I get your point~ which is why I was asking.  I think it will be obvious to anyone looking at it that the rope is new~ but I guess no way to gauge whether it was stored properly.,Jun 2020,May 26 2020,0
6188,Selling unused rope,1,5, If nothing else~ set a reasonable enough price and someone will likely buy it to use for something other than climbing. ,Oct 2018,May 26 2020,1
6189,Selling unused rope,1,6, Recommend you keep the rope~ and then use it till its worn out. Don't sell a 15-year old rope~ new or otherwise. Give it to someone~ if you must get rid of it. Maybe that person pays the shipping but give it away locally~ even better.,May 2015,May 26 2020,2

Also~ Trango phases are great as well.  Light (30g as well)~ easy to clip as well~ and very cheap.,Jul 2016,May 26 2020,0
6194,Litewire VS. Oz~ BD Carabiner comparison,1,3, I just got my new colored Litewires in and comparing them to the Oz. The Litewires come in at 32g and the Oz are 27g~ which I just weighed here at home. They are basically the same size and same size gate opening. Litewire are slightly stronger at 24kn vs 20kn on the Oz. The Oz do have the hoodwire feature which is nice for preventing snags on gear loops~ runners~ rope~ etc. $10 vs $7 for full price.,Dec 2012,May 26 2020,1
6195,Litewire VS. Oz~ BD Carabiner comparison,1,4, Litewires are basically upgraded neutrinos: lighter and with slightly better handling IMO.  Litewires are more or less the exact size of neutrinos.  The Ozs don't handle very well I think--the gate action is a little stickier~ the gate clearance isn't as big I don't think~ and the nose is a lot fatter.  The no-snag gate is nice~ but not nearly as good as the DMM Chimera in the same size/weight class.  ,Apr 2017,May 26 2020,2
6196,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,0, I've resisted bouldering for 15 years but with the current climate I think I better change my tune. I want to buy a crash pad. I don't want to spend a fortune~ conversely I'll probably have the pad for next 15 years and I don't want to regret cheaping out. Here's the pads I'm considering: -Mad Rock Mad Pad -Metolious Session II -Black Diamond Circuit Can anyone give me a comparison of these pads? The info online is shockingly sparse~ (outdoorgearlab~ 99boulders~ climber dad on YouTube~ and consumer reviews - that's it)  If I pay $50-$100 more then we get into the range of Organic~ Kinetic~ Asana pads and the higher end pads from the big companies. Kinetic seems to make the best pads in the industry~ but maybe I'm not understanding the appeal of Organic. Anyone care to sell me on spending a little more? I could see the using the couch feature of the Mad Pad a ton. The extracurricular uses of a pad are important to me as my trend of avoiding bouldering will invariably resume. Thoughts?,Mar 2016,May 17 2020,1
6197,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,1, For reference I won't be highballing anything (maybe the odd 30' first bolt). V3-4 is where I will spend the brunt of my time and current limit is V6. I live in SoCal and and mainly climb up and down the west coast~ on granite whenever possible.,Mar 2016,May 17 2020,0
6198,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,2, The Session II seems to be durable - I bought a well-used one~ to go with my Backcountry/Metolius pad which is basically identical~ and the old doesn’t really feel like it has lost much of its resilience. ,Oct 2017,May 17 2020,2
6199,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,3, The Session II seems to retail around $160 when I did a quick check. I have an Organic Simple Pad that I bought and customized with colours~ etc. for $175 and it is PERFECT.  I absolutely love it. Why?  Hell if I know but it is truly just awesome. So there you go:  Probably not at all helpful but if you have $175 to spend~ I would go with the Organic Simple.,Nov 2018,May 17 2020,3
6200,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,4, It sounds like you're planning on doing more bouldering since it can be done solo? If so I'd recommend a big pad. As an awkward introvert~ I spend plenty of time doing various forms of solo climbing~ and it's often surprising how little a problem has to traverse or overhang before you're no longer above your little 3' x 4' pad. The extra area of something like the BD Mondo or the Triple Mad Pad is definitely welcome. Or possibly even better~ get two smaller pads that strap together easily.,Sep 2012,May 17 2020,12
6201,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,5, I’m pretty happy with my metolius pads. Not great for high boulders though,Feb 2013,May 17 2020,0
6202,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,6, Second this. I have two 3x4’s plus a small 2x3ish auxiliary pad~ and I regularly use all 3 at once. Strap them together or maybe look at the Mad Rock Duo - it includes a system to carry a second pad. ,Oct 2017,May 17 2020,0
6203,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,7," A trifold would be great for my current~ solo needs and this seems like prudent advice. I'd love the extra size for safety~ and longer term if I build a wall at home then a trifold seems ideal.   However~ when things return to ""normal"" I probably won't boulder much and if I do it would likely be with other people. A small pad would be easier to bring along casual for sport climbing~ camping~ or a picnic (although a trifold would make a nice bed).  ",Mar 2016,May 17 2020,0

It also makes a nice couch and is my bed with a sheet of foam over it",Feb 2013,May 17 2020,0
6205,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,9, I started out with two Mad Rock Madpads. They're extremely light~ but the fabric is not durable and the foam softened significantly after a few years. Several of my frequent partners have Metolius pads~ I'm not a fan. They're thin and heavy~ I've hurt my ankle bottoming them out before. I replaced my Madpads with an Organic big pad and I'm never going back. They're much more durable and while on the heavy side~ have higher quality foam. Would highly recommend forking out the extra cash for a pad that'll last.,Oct 2016,May 17 2020,1
6206,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,10, I'd go big if I were you~ especially if you plan to buy only one. The sizes vary~ of course~ and I only just realized this~ but trifolds are roughly twice as big as regular pads -- around 24 sq ft (6x4) vs 12 (4x3).,Aug 2017,May 17 2020,1
6207,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,11, I currently own an Organic~ a Mad Rock~ and a Black Diamond Mondo. I've also owned two Metolius pads in the past.  If you really want to get 15 years out of a pad I'd highly recommend an Organic brand pad. The foam used by Organic does not seem to deteriorate (become softer) over time like other pads. The quality of fabric and stitching is also very high with Organic.  The Black Diamond Mondo is decent in both foam quality and construction. My only complaint is that it lacks a suitcase style handle along the seam on the underside which would be useful for quick relocation between problems.  Just like everything they sell~ the Mad Rock pads are cheap junk. I own a the triple fold model. The straps are are not sewn on correctly~ the foam has become very soft~ and the third section is slowly becoming detached due to poor quality thread. It is also made from a much lighter weight Cordura than most other pads. I highly recommend crossing the Mad Rock off your list of pads to consider.  The two Metolius pads I owned were also of decent quality. The buckles used on those pads are much nicer than others and the way they pack up is also well thought out. I would say that the Metolius pads are equal in quality and value to the Black Diamond offerings.  In summary~ you get what you pay for with crash pads. My recommendation is to consider spending a few extra dollars and getting an Organic Simple Pad rather than any of the pads on your list.,Jan 2011,May 17 2020,5
6208,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,12, I notice you haven't mentioned anything about Flashed. I would recommend checking them out at least. ,May 2020,May 26 2020,2
6209,Crash pads for the reluctant boulderer,1,13, If you're going solo~ I'd definitely agree with the advice to get two pads that strap together well~ or at least make sure one has a comfortable suitcase handle. You'll look dumb hiking with all that on you~ but it's worth it. One big pad is a little less versatile depending on how much the problem wanders or how rocky/uneven the landing is. I've used Metolius and Black Diamond and both felt equally high-quality. The Metolius has lasted about 10 years~ but it's starting to get a little thin. You'll be safe with either brand. Organic pads sure are pretty though and felt just as good on the rare occasion I got to use one.,Jul 2015,May 26 2020,1
6210,Canyoneering with dynamic rope,1,0, I read that if you use a dynamic rope for canyoneering you cannot use it for lead climbing anymore. Does this still apply to dry-ropes?,Mar 2018,May 25 2020,0
6211,Canyoneering with dynamic rope,1,1, I would use an old rope. Canyons are hard on ropes Sand ~ water and sharp edges can destroy a dynamic rope. Look into getting a canyon rope or two it’s worth it they are light and more durable. I’ve had mine for years I use them once or twice a year,Jul 2007,May 25 2020,0
6212,Canyoneering with dynamic rope,1,2, I am not a big canyoneer but am really curious why rappelling on a rope would make it unusable for leading. Dry or standard finish even if it got wet. What was the context of this statement. Obviously if you did something that damaged the rope or a canyon trip that was particularly hard on a dynamic rope because of abrasion due to stretching it would be of concern. I’m sure someone else will weigh in here. ,Jan 2013,May 25 2020,0
6213,Canyoneering with dynamic rope,1,3, Quick sand~ cactus~ hard pulls. Feel free to bring a nice climbing rope it’s up to you but your going to wish you didn’t. ,Jul 2007,May 25 2020,0
6214,Canyoneering with dynamic rope,1,4, The issue is that when canyoneering roes get dumped into the sand and they get wet. That sand gets in between the fibers and as the rope stretches and relaxes the sand acts as a saw on the fibers. For canyoneering you really want a static rope but short of that my dynamic ropes become canyoneering ropes. After that~ I sell them to horse packers.,Jul 2007,May 25 2020,1
6215,Canyoneering with dynamic rope,1,5, If you do it once you'll probably be fine~ but your gear will suffer. Do it more than once and you're asking for bad things to happen. Not only will it cost you a lot of money by destroying your rope (comments above) but the amount of sawing it over edges can snap your rope with you on it (I have heard more than one story of this happening).  Static ropes are a lot cheaper anyways so if you're looking at more than 1 dry canyon go buy one. If a wet canyon~ don't even think about bringing your climbing rope. The canyon will eat your rope (and possibly you) alive. I would go look at canyoneering USA. They'll ha e more info about all this stuff.

6222,Quality Issues With Climb-X Hangers,1,6," I've had a look thru the linked posts.   As a materials engineer~ I'd say that the failed hangers should be analyzed to see what steel they actually are~ and to try to see why they failed. If someone has some samples of failed hangers they can send them to me. Message me for my address.   Best would be if ClimbX has this done by an independent failure analysis company.   Just looking at the various photos~ and not knowing many facts other than that~ the obvious observations are:   - not much visible bulk corrosion   - not much plastic deformation   - they didn't break at the point of highest tensile stress (on the outside of the bend)   From what I've read of various people's theories of failure~ I would say:   (1) Failure due to ""Chinese steel"": well~ a huge amount of steel is made in China~ it's not the PLACE that's the issue~ it's the quality control on who supplied it~ and who bought it. A supply chain issue.    If it's for a safety critical item like a hanger~ then you need to know what you're getting.   And then you'll pay a bit more.   If you are a reputable manufacturer~ with control of your supply chain~ QA system in place and you produce to the relevant standards~ then stuff like this is much less likely to happen to you (and to your customers)   (2) Confusion over supply of indoors steel versus outdoors stainless steel: well~ without knowing what steel is used indoors~ I doubt this is responsible. It hasn't seemed to fail due to bulk corrosion (which steel mean't for indoors might have)~ and if it failed due to applied load~ well how is that different from an indoors hanger?? Unless they are badly designed~ and made of very brittle steel that cracks like that.   Without knowing anything more~ I'd bet that it's going to be something like:   - Wrong type of steel used (something like grade 303 stainless). 303 has been shown to crack like this due to crevice corrosion~ due to the sulphur content in 303~ which is there to make it machinable~ but makes for poor corrosion resistance   - SCC~ again due to poor match of material to the environment (which incidentally might NOT be the fault of the manufacturer if they say do NOT use in this sort of application)   - wrong application by end user: do they say that these hangers can or cannot be used in places like this? Perhaps their info says only place inn a desert~ etc etc.   BearBreeder makes a good point: it might NOT be their fault. So rather get some facts first.   But it DOES seem poor.   The only info I have on CimbX hangers is from their web site~ on the PitBull hanger.   They say it is ""rated"" to 25kN.   No mention of any certification (UIAA or EN).   They say it's made of 304 ""marine grade""~ which is somewhat confusing~ usually ""marine grade"" is applied to 316.   The UIAA's findings are that 304 is a poor choice for outdoor's anchors anywhere. You're better off with 316 in areas where no SCC is expected. 316 costs just a bit more and is MUCH more resistant to pitting.   In the EU you cannot buy any safety critical construction anchors made of 304~ only 316 or better.   If they were either UIAA or EN certified then they could be pressurized into doing a recall and taking direct action. But since they are not (or don't SEEM to carry one for these hangers)~ there's not much that can be done like that.   My advice would be to buy safety critical climbing gear from manufacturers who carry a UIAA or CE mark. That doesn't solve every issue~ but it's a step in the right direction.

Second~ I think it's been pretty obvious to everybody who has been paying attention to this outfit that it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. If you don't know what I'm talking about~ see: mountainproject.com/v/climb… dpmclimbing.com/articles/vi…   I knew one of their reps back when they first got started~ and he gave me the whole inside story~ trying to make it sound like it was on the up-and-up~ but even coming out of the mouth of someone who shamelessly advocated for them~ and twisted all the facts to their favor~ it was pretty clear that ClimbX was (and is) a shady-as-hell company making knock-off gear that only a fool would trust. Figures that the rep was the sketchiest stoner of a free-solo artist you've ever met.   The worst part - none of their gear is actually that much cheaper. Usually $15-20~ so maybe a couple of hundred bucks cheaper~ if you are buying~ like~ a complete double set of cams. So~ don't see how it's worth it. ,Apr 2011,Aug 10 2014,0

And I think it's a good idea to start to document issues/failures a bit better.   I'm talking to our web site and legal people about what we can do as the UIAA to help.   There's an obvious issue with liability~ so we'd need to be careful not to make unfounded claims.   But I don't think a list of ""issues"" with anchors is going to cause problems.   With details and photos.   And any materials analysis posted as well.   And manufacturers could post comments as well if they wanted to.   I'd like to be able to put links to forums etc on it~ so people can follow what others say.   So to get the ball rolling~ if you have samples of failures I'd like to get them.

6231,Quality Issues With Climb-X Hangers,1,15," Understandably ClimbX is a company making knockoffs of MadRock. I've read the stories and articles~ court documents~ etc. However~ I'm pretty sure another climbing gear manufacturer produces all of it's products in China as well~ and people revere them as the greatest ever. And come to think about it~ most carabiners are manufactured in China~ and a lot of other life saving climbing gear.    I would be more apt to attribute gear failure to human error not manufacturing. Not to say that manufacturing issues don't happen(CCH) but most QC catches that. The second picture in 20 kN's post is hard to tell why it is failed~ but I wonder if it is caused by the hanger not laying flat on the rock causing excessive strain. The first picture definitely appears to be due to corrosion~ and that looks very similar to the photo bearbreeder posted~ which is Fixe.    I think what should really be taken away from any of this is that no gear lasts forever and anything fixed on a climb~ bolts included should be treated with some degree of caution. And remember as I was once told~ ""It's called stain-less steel~ not rust-proof steel."" Every element eventually wants to be lead.",Mar 2014,Aug 10 2014,0

6234,Quality Issues With Climb-X Hangers,1,18, I recently came across a cracked Climb X hanger here in Acadia National Park~ Maine.   This was the crux bolt on a route that was equipped in 2012/13.  It is in a moist~ wooded environment~ but the route itself does not see much running water.  It is also inland enough that the coastal fog is not a serious concern.  The bolt was seemingly well placed (flush against the wall) in good granite.   I thought I was just going to replace the cracked hanger.  Maybe they all need to go...,Dec 2013,Aug 10 2014,0

6236,Quality Issues With Climb-X Hangers,1,20," Several of the posts in this thread seemingly accuse ClimbX of manufacturing products in China in order to avoid U.S. patent laws.     I doubt that this really has anything to do with patents.   If Madrock has U.S. patents~ (and a quick patent search I ran showed 5 of them relating to rock shoe design) and ClimbX is violating those patents~ then ClimbX would not be allowed to sell the infringing products in the U.S.~ regardless of where those products were manufactured.  Manufacturing in China doesn't give you immunity from U.S. patent laws~ unless the patent deals with methods of manufacture (not the case with Madrock's patents.)       It is unlikely that ClimbX is manufacturing products in China ""to sidestep very respectable laws.""  It's more likely that ClimbX is manufacturing in China because China has the manufacturing infrastructure that allows ClimbX to contract manufacture its products at a Chinese factory without having to front the capital to build its own manufacturing facilities.  (Same reason that most footwear these days is made overseas.)     With regards to ""knock-off"" products~ copying another company's designs is legitimate~ provided you are not infringing any patents.  Black Diamond had a patent monopoly on twin axle cams for a while.  When their patent expired~ several other companies came out with twin axle cams.  I'm glad that they did~ because I prefer some of these ""knock off"" designs to BD's original.  Same with Dynafit ski bindings.  Once the Dynafit patent expired~ we've seen a lot of competition and innovation.  ""Knock-off"" products provide price competition and innovation competition.  There is not (and shouldn't be) any sort of gentleman's agreement not to copy a competitor's product.  (Where would we be if everyone decided not to ""knock off"" Boreal's idea to use sticky rubber on a rock shoe?)  If you want exclusivity~ and want to protect innovative qualities of your product~ then get a patent.  Utility patents are there to protect innovative inventions.  Design patents are there to protect distinctive designs.       Glancing at the material that was linked here regarding the Madrock/ClimbX disputes~ it appears to me that their fight had nothing at all to do with patents.  It seems like Madrock moved their production from China to Vietnam~ and ClimbX contracted with the Chinese manufacturer that Madrock was previously using to make shoes that were similar or identical to those that Madrock was making there.  Unless Madrock owned the equipment that the shoes were being manufactured on (highly unlikely) or unless Madrock had a non-compete agreement with the Chinese facility that it would not produce similar rock shoes for any competitor (possible~ but difficult to enforce because small changes would probably be sufficient to get around this prohibition) or unless Madrock had a non-compete agreement in place with the ClimbX founders (more likely~ but probably unenforceable under California law where Madrock is located) then there really is nothing that would prevent ClimbX from doing what it was doing~ and that is true whether ClimbX was making shoes in China~ in the U.S.~ or in any other country.     I don't own any Madrock or ClimbX products.  I don't have any connection or affiliation with either company.  However~ it seems like there are some fundamental misunderstandings in this thread regarding common business practices.   The key question here is whether or not ClimbX maintains proper quality control over its products and whether the hangars it's selling are safe.  All of the misstatements regarding ""patent violations"" just serve to muddy the waters.",Jan 2006,Aug 10 2014,0

6241,Quality Issues With Climb-X Hangers,2,4, I think that a few people are misunderstanding the reason for popular objection to climbX. It isn't that they did some illegal patent thing~ or that their products are obviously all complete junk. The main objection I think is that if you pay attention to their history~ they seem to be a pretty slimy company~ whether or not they did anything technically illegal. And slimy companies tend to cut corners.   If I think a company is cutting corners - if I get that feeling in my gut - I'm not going to wait for their case to wend its way through the lawyers and courts - I'm going to err on the side of safety and use gear from a company that doesn't give me that feeling~ of which there are many. In fact~ of all the companies making gear today~ I would say climbX is the only one (okay~ one of two)~ that gives me that feeling. That's a purely subjective judgment~ but there you go.   Irrational? Sure.    Safe? Very.   I'll admit I jumped the gun in saying 'this was bound to happen' - but I stand by my gut feeling~ which is that these guys seem slimy~ and that even if this wasn't a QC issue~ it probably will be next time. Maybe someday there will be an open-and-shut case where some poor soul takes the long dive because ClimbX tried to pass off a carabiner made of very firm cheese~ and everybody will be satisfied~ finally. I~ personally~ do not want to be that soul.,Apr 2011,Aug 11 2014,0

6247,Sterling Helix 9.5 durability,1,0, Anyone else have issue with this rope literally falling apart? Mine coreshot on day five of using it~ and I had to cut about 15ft off the end. On day 7 or 8 the other end turned into a super thick fuzzy caterpillar so I had to cut off another 10-15ft. At least I bought the 70m~ so it's still usable as a ~60m. The rest of the rope looks super old and worn down even though it's gotten way less use than my other ropes. I've mostly used it for sport climbing~ and on none of the routes have there been any issues with excessive rock abrasion. Wondering what gives with this shitty rope I bought. I've pretty much retired it after about 20 days climbing on it.,Nov 2017,May 24 2020,0

6253,Sterling Helix 9.5 durability,1,6," I'd like to add that it's possible to core shot a brand new rope at no fault to the rope. Also check all your gear surfaces where it contacts the rope. Two things that will easily eat a rope is mixing up the ""bolt end"" of a quickdraw with the rope end.  Also I had a worn out grigri2 that would ""glaze"" ropes if I rappelled with it. There is a groove on the inside that will become razor sharp and easily heats up and glazes ropes. The new grigri has fixed that problem by making that surface much wider.",Feb 2014,May 24 2020,4

6255,Sterling Helix 9.5 durability,1,8, It was a fairly big fall that coreshot it~ but it was caught by a brand new petzl spirit draw oriented correctly. I was belaying my buddy on a trad route and he fell ~25ft from ~40ft up. Rope was running in a clean line through the pro and not rubbing the rock. I'll forgive the coreshot because it was a high-ish fall factor~ but the wear on the rest of it is pretty strange. It does seem like there was a bad batch or something because everyone seems to have different experiences.,Nov 2017,May 24 2020,0
6256,Sterling Helix 9.5 durability,1,9, Very strange indeed. I feel like high fall factor falls will make the rope lose elasticity~ get flat spots~ and feel dead over time~ but shouldn't cause a core shot. Makes me wonder if it snagged a piece of rock or a bolt stud or something. Or yeah maybe just a bad batch. I beat the hell out of mine~ hundreds of pitches each~ dozens of decent sized falls~ and eventually retired them just due to age and general wearing out~ but never managed to core shot them. I had a similar experience to yours but with Blue Water Icon 9.1s - they core shot super easily to the point where I wondered if it was bad luck or bad batch.,Aug 2014,May 24 2020,0
6257,Sterling Helix 9.5 durability,1,10, On our second helix.  One of the best ropes I've used (and I've owned edelweiss edelrid bluewater Beal ect) The second one is going great and catches well and handles well.  The 1st one we had was great for 2 or 3 years I forget.  It got cut during some serious rockfall so not the ropes fault.

6258,Sterling Helix 9.5 durability,1,11, I've had two 9.5 dryxp helixes. First one was amazing~ fed great and gave amazing catches. It got stolen but insurance covered it so I got a new one... This one feeds like total crap. Everyone I talk to guesses that it's a 10mm rope and the people who remember my last rope cant believe this is the same model. I'm somewhat concerned that the durability of my new rope will be lesser. I contacted sterling and they told me to climb on it a bit more to break it in and then let them know if I'm still having the same issue. After ~4 months of using the rope I sent them a follow up 5 days ago saying there is no change in quality. Still waiting to hear back(they usually respond sooner~ but might be understaffed due to covid).,Oct 2013,May 25 2020,2

6307,Backpacking Tent Choice W/ A Baby,1,0, Hello~ Does anyone have advice on tent size for backpacking with two adults a baby and a dog? My wife and I have been happy with a Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL 2 for use with the dog but now have a baby to drag (carry) along with us. I've been looking at the Copper Spur HVUL3 vs 4 person version. The 4 person is about a pound heavier~ but maybe this weight sacrifice will pay dividends in better night sleep with everyone in the tent? Or maybe the Hotel fly version of the Copper Spur 3 to keep the dog outside the tent?  Any advise is welcome. Thanks for your time. Ryan,Nov 2007,May 22 2020,0
6308,Backpacking Tent Choice W/ A Baby,1,1, I own a Copper Spur UL3 which can fit two adults (5'10 each) and a 60 pound boxer~ and still feels like a palace. If the dog sleeps by your feet you can definitely fit a baby in the middle with room to spare. I've considered the Hotel version but cannot justify the extra weight since the one I own is so spacious. ,Feb 2018,May 24 2020,1
6309,Backpacking Tent Choice W/ A Baby,1,2, You might consider a Black Diamond Mega Light. I have the older megamid version~ which fits my family of four and the occasional dog. Plenty of room for lounging and it's light~ which offsets all the baby stuff you have to schlep around. We use it both with and without a floor depending on the situation. Now there's a full zip up net option for when it's super buggy. It's also super quick to set up~ so you can stop along the way for nap time if the need arises. Have fun out there!,Mar 2001,May 24 2020,1
6310,Backpacking Tent Choice W/ A Baby,1,3, I used a Mega Light (and earlier versions) for quite a while. They definitely offer a lot of interior space for the small packed size and light weight~ especially if you leave the floor and the netting at home (both of those are extra cost options~ btw). A couple of times I was able to hang the tent from a tree branch and not use the center pole at all~ which was really nice.,Jul 2005,May 24 2020,0
6311,Backpacking Tent Choice W/ A Baby,1,4, We have a Copper Spur 4 person- UL and it’s huge. We have fit 3 adults~ two kids (4 & 6) and most of our gear too. Prob bigger than you need. And when you are backpacking with children every ounce counts more! (Actually backpack volume matters most! Sleeping bags do NOT go in stuff sacks. Cram every inch possible)  i guess it depends a lot on what kinda trips you are doing. You can still get distance in with kids that are carried. Once they walk you lose that for a while.

6320,seized locker gate on rappel,1,0, Yesterday my friend and I were on our second rappel~ the one that would take us to the ground. She went first and when it was my turn~ the locker connected to the anchor from my PAS would not open. It was a terrible hanging belay and I was able to get up close enough to the locker to try to get it to release~ but after some time I just couldn't. Thankfully I had started climbing with a knife several years ago~ so I cut the PAS and left my locker (sorry Utah~ this guy is on some anchor between the school room roof and the ground~ next to hatchet crack). The locker was an old Vaporlock~ I had never had any issues with it before . I have seen lockers get stuck~ when something gets in the gate or when you crank them too tight. I feel fairly confident I didn't crank on this one~ but who knows.  If I didn't have a knife~ what are my other options?,Jan 2012,May 22 2020,0
6321,seized locker gate on rappel,1,1, Instead of a knife carry a small multitool. Save your PAS :-),Sep 2013,May 22 2020,1
6322,seized locker gate on rappel,1,2, Another good trick for this is to just hit the gate with another biner in your palm~ kind of how you can bang on the back of a nut tool. If you screwed it too far closed it will sometimes take a little impact to get it moving again. This is a great trick for removing people's old bail quicklinks from the middle of sparsely bolted Eldo sport routes. Or your situation. Also helps when biners freeze up in winter. ,Nov 2012,May 22 2020,11

6324,seized locker gate on rappel,1,4, If you locked it while it was weighted sometimes the crab will flex JUST enough that the threads bind up once unweighted.

6325,seized locker gate on rappel,1,5, Don't use a PAS to begin with~ use a couple shoulder-length nylon slings set up as draws. Doesn't get in the way like a PAS while leading either. And don't use lockers~ just use regular carabiners but make it redundant.,Apr 2006,May 22 2020,5
6326,seized locker gate on rappel,1,6, I had this happen to a Metolius locker. I sent it to them and they fixed it free of charge. It needed to be lubricated. And you can't use oil based lubricant~ it should be graphite based. ,Sep 2013,May 22 2020,0
6327,seized locker gate on rappel,1,7, Lock your locking carabiners before you fully weight them and you won't have this problem. If you reweight the carabiner~ with 2 people if you need to it will stretch the carabiner a bit and free up the gate. If you still have problems~ replace the biners. Why didn't you just feed the rope until the tails went through the atc~ rethread them if you needed to do another rap and didn't have another locker or atc. Deal with the stuck carabiner once on the ground with Pliers if necessary.,Jan 2014,May 22 2020,0
6328,seized locker gate on rappel,1,8, Perhaps you really gave the screw gate a good twist closed ?  Sometimes if a screw gate gets screwed closed quite hard~ then loaded.. its surely a pain to get undone.  I had the same thing happen with a work descender.

6330,seized locker gate on rappel,1,10, I’ve had this happen when you over tighten certain types of lockers it while it’s weighted.  Trick that sometimes works is to rig a foot sling- give a weighted bounce while twisting the sleeve at the same time.  I’ve gathered a few booty lockers with this trick.  If you happen to have very thin cord or shoelace you can also position a small prussic over the sleeve to create a “ biner wrench” ( as I call it) to grip the tube . Using the tail ends makes a kind of handle with a bit more leverage. And edit to add- yeah like Greg said- I generally just use two slings to clip in .   A locker for clipping in the climbing rope as a backup. If there are Mussys i just double bowline the lead rope directly to them .,Mar 2009,May 22 2020,7

6333,seized locker gate on rappel,1,13, thanks!! this was very helpful. I think I did lock it with a little weight on it because i was lower than the anchors~ making an attempt to stand on the chicken head~ but since I'm 5'1 it wasn't possible to reach everything. Thanks LCC ;) I really like the PAS for rappeling as you can adjust the distance to the anchors as needed~ but usually don't use it while climbing. I also like rappel off the PAS~ though I understand people's opposing opinions. ,Jan 2012,May 22 2020,0

6335,seized locker gate on rappel,1,15, Yes~ for weighted vs. unweighted can lock up either way. Yes~ bang in with something. It's like a stuck jelly jar. Quicker than other shenanigans. I just stop as soon as I feel the screw gate softly touch the end. Never had an issue. I've dealt with stuck~ rusty steel biners in other applications~ never took more than a couple whacks to release one. I'm not carrying a heavy multi-tool on every climb. PAS is good for beginners. After a while you can use other other stuff that serves more than one purpose. I have a small BD Magnetron as my tether locker. #1 for ease of use. Won't get stuck. Wouldn't use it where it could ice up though. Reversed and opposed regular biners are more secure than a locker~ but I don't want the extra time/hassle/taking up room on the powerpoint for my tether.,Oct 2011,May 22 2020,0
6336,seized locker gate on rappel,1,16," Yea~ do what he says. Resist the temptation to snug the collar tight as you rappel. It's a common fear thing: ""Whoa~ I hope this biner is solid.

6346,seized locker gate on rappel,2,5, That used to be common advice~ but is now mostly obsolete. I do the exact opposite~ I gently tighten mine down against the collar. Backing off half a turn is irrelevant to practically all carabiners made today because the screwgate sleeve doesn't touch anything as the carabiner flexes and engaged the gate. Even at maximal load~ the locking sleeve doesn't experience any new forces and unscrews as easily as before the carabiner was loaded.,Jun 2019,May 22 2020,2
6347,seized locker gate on rappel,2,6, It's surprising how flexible carabiners really are. Up on El Cap I had two full haul bags hanging from the anchor. Of course everything was backed up~ but their weight was held by a Petzl locker of the design which Tamiban describes above. The locking screw never actually contacts the gate~ specifically for the purpose of preventing what most likely happened to the OP. So even when the locker is tightened down~ you can wiggle the gate a little. I was killing time (a lot of time) while my partner unlocked the intricacies of the pitch above~ all while doing his best to live to tell the tale. For some reason I reached over and tried to wiggle the gate. It was frozen in place. The weight of the haul bags was stretching~ deforming~ the 'biner until the end of the gate was pulled up tight against the key-lock. Not the locking screw~ the key-lock at the other end of the gate from the hinge. It was clear that were I to open the locking screw and tap the gate open with my hammer~ the 'biner would fail. Hmmm.,Apr 2004,May 22 2020,1

6351,seized locker gate on rappel,2,10, Typical open gate strength on a modern carabiner is 8kN~ which is more force than a FF1 on the anchor. Most climbers have never loaded a carabiner beyond the open gate limit~ even during a hard lead fall.,Jul 2019,May 22 2020,0

6355,seized locker gate on rappel,2,14, People are telling stories of being unable to unscrew their lockers~ but you are saying that doesn't happen? Am I misreading this? No~ I didn't say screwgates don't get stuck. I said the advice to back off a quarter turn on screwgates is old and obsolete~ and it's better general practice to gently tighten screwgates snug against the lock-ring.  People are getting their gates stuck because they're cranking them down while they're gripped. The interface between the locking sleeve and the lock-ring is conical and confers mechanical advantage. As you tighten it closed~ you're increasing the pressure of the sleeve against wire stop ring. This mechanical advantage doesn't work in reverse. With many lockers in any condition~ if you crank them closed as hard as you can by hand~ when you try to open them~ you'll find that they're just barely beyond hand-tight and require a tool to open. I just did this with my Petzl Sm'D. In adverse conditions of being gripped~ with dirt in the gate~ you can get a screwgate stuck on accident.,Jun 2019,May 22 2020,2
6356,seized locker gate on rappel,2,15, Tamiban is correct~ a modern design screw gate is going to get stuck by over tightening on the retaining ring. The only way weighting the Biner could cause an issue is if there was enough weight that the body of the biner flexed enough that the nose hit the barrel of the screw gate. That would take a LOT of weight.  I just tested with full body weight and could not cause the nose to to touch the barrel.  ,Oct 2011,May 22 2020,1
6357,seized locker gate on rappel,2,16, No~ I didn't say screwgates don't get stuck. I said the advice to back off a quarter turn on screwgates is old and obsolete~ and it's better general practice to gently tighten screwgates snug against the lock-ring.  Well~ old gear requires old practices. I just went through my assortment of lockers and found 4 where the collar screws tight up against the nose. All are most likely older than your gear.

6361,seized locker gate on rappel,3,0, I  had an old Stubai steel locker bend permanently under the weight of several bags of food~ probably about 80 lbs~ when doing a bear hang. We hadn't screwed the gate closed. Upon retrieval the gate was slightly open and the notch wouldn't line up with the gate. Makes me wonder if modern steel carabiners are also that susceptible to bending. Was this a bad biner or were they trying to avoid making it too brittle?

6368,Ice axes,1,0, Hey~ I'm looking to get into ice climbing and need some input regarding ice axes. I'm looking at the Petzl nomic~ BD Fuel and Grivel tech machine. Any suggestions?,May 2020,May 23 2020,0
6369,Ice axes,1,1, There are 10 years of threads on some of the differences. I would just buy which ever you find the best deal on~ they all climb well enough. The Trango tools are inexpensive and replacement picks are cheap; Cassin picks are also inexpensive. If you have a very large or very small hand then the tool choice can matter a bit more (some fit certain extremes of size better). The classic recommendation is to go ice cragging and try your friends/partners/everyones tools; sometimes this is most easily done at an ice fest. And if you still can't decide~ just get some used Petzl Nomics and consider the Pur Ice picks.,Aug 2011,May 23 2020,3
6370,Ice axes,1,2, None of them suck and it comes down to personal preference~ so it doesn't really matter which you get as a beginner. Barring preference I think the Petzl system is nice (they tend to keep parts around for a while in contrast to Grivel~ and the tools are pretty modular with pick weights). ,Sep 2013,May 23 2020,0

6373,Ice axes,1,5, All the above is true~ but he’s a beginner looking for a clear~ decisive answer.    Buy the Nomics,Jun 2013,May 23 2020,4
6374,Ice axes,1,6, I would get the Tech machines~ use them twice~ sell them on Mountain proj because youre hand wont fit in the handle with big gloves~ then get the Nomics~ decide that you don't like them because you dont trust the plastic pommel~ sell those to a friend~ Buy the BD fuels because you got a pro deal~ climb on them once on a really cold day then you sell those because the picks cause the ice to dinner plate too much for your liking.  Simultaneously do this with crampons and boots~ while trying to get the boots to fit your feet~ and the crampons that you have at the moment to fit your boots.  All this to climb a rambling WI3.,Nov 2014,May 23 2020,13

The funny thing is granite is one of the easier rock types to clean so it's kinda zero sum to use wire on it anyways.    Get a couple grout brushes like the grout demon and a few HDX brushes.

6417,Best brush for cleaning up choss,2,15, For granite many of the wire brushes posted here will work.  Be careful not overdoing it though... Another brush that works great for developing are the blue gear clean brushes made for bicycles - Park Tools   I buy a couple each time i go to the bike shop.  Good stiff nylon brush on one end and the other end made for cleaning the gears is great for scraping and picking at loose stuff.  Also a small flathead screwdriver for picking off small flakes. Recently we discovered that a pine cone works GREAT!  Find one that is semi-decomposed and use it like a wool pad!  For moss and some lichen a flat piece of bark also works awesome.  With both of these you can scrub really well and not over do it!! Another tip.....after the initial choss is gone~ a spray bottle will work for the final cleaning.  Great for newly developed rock and also existing problems.  Gets all the dirt and chalk off....spray at the end of the day or if it is sunny and warm spray then wait a bit....good to go!  This can be quite addicting after a bit!!,Jan 2020,May 13 2020,0

6424,Best brush for cleaning up choss,3,2," Legit point. I agree that a power tool and wire brush maybe a bit heavy handed.  But~ the assertion that the sandstone is too soft for anything but a synthetic brush seems arbitrary.  Melissa shows Santa Barbara as home and the sandstone patina along the Camino Cielo is pretty hard. I compare it to our Tyee Sandstone in Oregon's Callahan's which take stiff wire brushes and scrapers without any problems. Fair. I have only climbed at Lizards mouth~ brickyard and pine mtn~ which are all really soft. I would definitely cringe at seeing wire taken to those stones.   I'm not arguing that people that know what they are doing shouldnt use tools they find effective on stone that can handle it. I'm just thinking that people from all over the place ~with varying amounts of common sense ~ that will be interacting with all the different types of stone and their varying qualities will read things like this thread and go to town with the heaviest tool as opposed to the correct one. A lot of people just recommend going straight to wire when~ IMO~ the best tool is the ""lightest"" for the job. Sometimes you need a 8 foot pry bar and sometimes a 6"" wonderbar",Jul 2014,May 22 2020,1

6432,Resole for entry level shoe,1,0, I have some entry level scarpas that for my feet like a glove. The leather upper is in good shape and after a few years of good use the Rand and sole split on both shoes within a few days off each other. I can get them resoled for 50ish but wanted to know if using a moderate shoe would not benefit my foot work development as much as a better shoe would. If there is really no difference to how I might improve over the next few seasons I would rather resole them. Is a better shoe worth the investment in skills development? I will eventually get a few pairs for different types of terrain but am just trying to improve for the next few seasons and don't necessarily need high performance shoes now. Unless I'm inhibiting my skill development. Then I might reconsider. For reference low 5.11/v3 type climber. Want to improve both slab and overhung climbing. Current shoe edges well but smears are not my strong point. So I try to work that as well.,Jun 2018,May 21 2020,0
6433,Resole for entry level shoe,1,1," The conventional wisdom is that overhanging rock calls for downturned shoes. Which are anathema to smearing on low angle rock slab. OTOH if you are using ""slab"" in the sport climber sense of ""any face that's not overhanging""~ then aggressive shoes - but perhaps short of downturned - can make it easier to stand on very small edges.  I am tempted to say that well-fit~ aggressive shoes make it so much easier to use small holds that they can inhibit the development of good technique. A sort of ""cheating""~ if you will~ perhaps analogous to super-sidecut skis vis-a-vis classic turning technique whereby a good old school skier could make easy~ effective turns even with zero-sidecut boards. Most of us have watched better climbers dance up difficult routes wearing ridiculous footwear - blown out trad shoes~ sneakers~ alpine boots... SANDALS. I would argue that this is possible for them in part because they have very good footwork technique.",Jul 2009,May 22 2020,1
6434,Resole for entry level shoe,1,2, In my area there are a bunch of true slab boulders and routes and at some point I would like to develop more confidence in my footwork on those types of routes. I think resole is a good approach for now.,Jun 2018,May 22 2020,0
6435,Resole for entry level shoe,1,3," If you get a ""better"" pair of shoes you will still be able to develop your foot work. You may start to climb harder~ but then the foot work gets harder. You will learn new skills on harder climbs.  If it's a money thing sticking to your current shoes is probably the right choice. If it's just about skill development a d you have the disposable income I think you are better getting a ""better"" shoe(s). ",Apr 2011,May 22 2020,2

6441,Resole for entry level shoe,1,9, Those are done~ honestly.  Will definitely need rand repair and push your resole cost to close to the value of the shoe if not more when you factor in sales.  I’ve seen what Gunkie described but I don’t know if I would always attribute that to better footwork - often they’re just stronger.  When I use better shoes I find I’m able to use my feet much more efficiently~ so I use my arms less.  You’ll also get used to using smaller edges and feet that probably wouldn’t have been options in your current shoes.  Most professional climbing coaches (Anderson Bros~ Horst) strongly recommend using good shoes for footwork development.,Jul 2014,May 22 2020,0

6447,New shoes for intermediate climbing. Recommendations?,1,0, I'm looking for new shoes and want to take advantage of some sales going on right now. That means the REI sale and the Scarpa website sale. Or anything else that will offer free returns or is a local store to San Diego. I'm a size 11.5 street shoe and actually bought the Katana laces in 44.5~ 45~ 45.5. I don't like the fit on any of them. The 45.5 is tolerable but it rubs on my Achilles heel a lot when I move around in them and a little bit of toe pain. When relaxed it scrunches my toes a bit. I've read they don't really stretch though and I don't want to risk keeping a shoe that I will hate halfway up a climb every time. I'd love to try a 46 but they don't stock that size in REI and don't want to pay return shipping to Backcountry if it doesn't fit. They fit great width wise.  My first shoe which I currently wear is 5.10 Rogue laces in size 12 and they were kinda tight but no hot spots~ to begin with~ but now fit like a glove and are comfortable to just even walk around in. Trying on the Katanas made me realize I really like how stiff it is and I can imagine how secure I will feel on an edge that appeals to me. I need a shoe that I can take comfortably into harder climbs (5.10 ratings) near me and feel secure. The rogue's are not cutting it anymore and I get foot fatigue/cramps on thin edges and I feel like it's not as secure anymore.

6450,New shoes for intermediate climbing. Recommendations?,1,3, TC Pro. It's the only shoe. But really~ what style/rock are you climbing most? It sounds like you want something stiff for vertical edging so I'd suggest something like grandstones or TC's. I've heard people having achilles issues and solving it by cutting the heel of the rand~ but I'd try to get a more comfy shoe rather than doing that.  That being said~ your feet do get stronger the more you expose them to small edges. Shoes can definitely help~ but don't downplay the value of toughing it out.

6482,backpacking pack suggestion,1,0, I have a trip planned for the wind river range in august and need to purchase a larger backpack to carry climbing and camping equipment for a total of 5 days in the range +2 days of to and from travel (only checking one bag). I'll be splitting the load with one other person when I get to WY. So far I am between the~ 4400 Porter or Windrider (like the mesh pocket) from Hyperlite~ the Aether pro 70 from Osprey~ or maybe one of the terraframe models from Mystery Ranch since they are expandable and could accommodate my multipitch pack nicely. Any clear reasons why I should go for one over the other? Should I be avoiding any of these as potential options?,Oct 2013,May 19 2020,0

By comparison it feels heavy and over designed...,Apr 2017,May 19 2020,0
6484,backpacking pack suggestion,1,2, Fit. Try all 4 packs on in the store~ get a competent person to help you adjust them to your body~ and wear them around the store with enough weight in them to approximate the weight you'll be carrying on your trip~ and pick the one that feels best when it's loaded and on your back. If you can fit all your stuff in it~ and if the price is in your range~ the Arc'teryx Bora AR 63 liter is worth trying on~ if you haven't already. The Gregory Baltoro packs are worth trying on~ too.,Jul 2005,May 19 2020,2

6487,backpacking pack suggestion,1,5, Hyperlite packs carry like a dream~ i used to have a porter and always wanted the mesh pocket to throw stuff in~ water bottles~ etc. would make for a great cragging pack as well.

6490,backpacking pack suggestion,1,8," I have fairly extensive hands-on experience with all of those specific packs and own~ and have subsequently used and abused~ versions of all 3 (I own the HMG 3400 Southwest~ Aether Pro 70~ and MR Sawtooth~ which is just a hunting version of the TerraFrame series). They're all excellent packs and you can't go wrong~ quality wise~ with any of them. However~ first off~ Mark is absolutely right with fit being the most important thing to consider. When hauling loads as heavy as these packs are designed for~ a proper fit should be the first thing you consider. You'll be miserable if its not right and won't get a chance to enjoy the features of a pack that fits poorly. That being said~ it is possible that they could all fit you~ since they all fit me (~6'~ 170 lbs~ 30-31"" waist~ 18ish"" torso~ relatively slim upper body~ average width shoulders for a climber~ mesomorph body-type). So from now on I'll be operating under the assumption that you either can't try them on for whatever reason (but seriously~ try as hard as you can to do so~ since they feel quite different from each-other)~ or that you have had the opportunity to do so~ and find that they all fit you relatively well.",May 2017,May 19 2020,15
6491,backpacking pack suggestion,1,9, wow Ben you really went above and beyond to provide those comparisons. I really appreciate your insight on these products. It sounds like we have similar builds (usually a 31 or 32 in waist but same height and weight). Im heavily considering the Aether Pro at this point over the other two options. I think having the ability to carry a ton of more stuff with the Overhaul feature on the Terraframe packs is just going to make me want to take unnecessary equip. Initially~ the Windrider seemed like a great option because of the mesh pockets that I could use to stuff wet/sweaty clothing into~ to dry. I expect to be pretty close to the load limits on whatever pack I choose so having the extra support from the Aether and or even the Gregory pack will be important to me. Ill see if I can get my hands on both the Aether and the Baltoro you had mentioned as an alternative. Thanks everyone for your input! ,Oct 2013,May 20 2020,1

It's released. ,2,17, buddy and i are getting a double set. some delays but apparently on the way now. re cold; ive spent a fair bit of time in ledges in winter~ and on the ground~ almost always with xtherms. aside from the usual precautions about sharp stuff~ theres no problems with either integrity or ice inside. as for any really cold stuff~ id still put a cell foam on top.,Dec 2019,Dec 12 2019,1
6533,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,2,18, Concerning moisture/ice crystals inside upon inflation~ I have an XTherm air mat and I always use the inflation bag every time. This way I’m never blowing moisture into my mat. It seems faster anyway~ and I don’t get light headed trying to blow up my mat at high elevations. The inflation bag doubles as a stuff sack for food or clothes also~ as well as a pillow at night. So I have no reason not to bring it and use it. The G7 comes with an inflation bag~ and i’ll probably do the same. Edit: I just looked~ I am order #95. I’m starting to lose hope that it will arrive before Christmas. Bummer. ,May 2016,Dec 13 2019,0

6536,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,3,1, Can't wait to see more on these. As you cats get yours~ please post up some pics.  If you fly to big wall locations~ a regular portaledge is painful and expensive to tote around. If you net off the weight of carrying a sleeping mat~ these are crazy light compared with a standard ledge.  I use a similar inflation bag for my two-person packraft~ they are quite fast and efficient.  Looks like a great piece of kit! Japan-john ,Dec 2008,Dec 13 2019,1
6537,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,3,2, I'm backer #102 and my partner is #148. From the beginning we were looking to use these ledges for an expedition in mid-January. I understand delays~ but I suspect I'm not alone in wishing there would be a little bit more proactive communication and transparency. The last Kickstarter Update was November 14th and indicated the first batch would ship in late November and more batches would ship every two weeks. It didn't indicate batch size. The last Grade VII Facebook post was November 16th and their last Instagram post was November 9th and neither mentioned ship dates/delays. Fingers crossed!!! If anyone reading this has received~ or receives~ their ledge~ could you please post up when it arrived and your backer #?,Jun 2001,Dec 18 2019,4

6541,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,3,6, Just got notification that the first batch was delayed by 4 days and it will ship on the 20th for the USA Warehouse (From British Columbia I assume)~ once it reaches that warehouse~ it'll be repacked and shipped to backers. I'll be very surprised if it arrives before the end of the year for the first 50 backers. But at least the company is super responsive to update requests~ always responding to me within a day with actual info instead of general vagueness like I've jhad with other kickstarter projects I've supported. I'm bummed at the delays but happy with the company thus far.,Jan 2007,Dec 19 2019,8
6542,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,3,7, Well the most recent update (#9) indicates they’re actively shipping (yay)! Although in batches of 10-30 per week means I’m looking at at least 5-15 weeks before my ledges ship which will~ unfortunately~ not get them to us before our mid-January departure :(,Jun 2001,Dec 21 2019,0

6550,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,3,15, It's just you.   The ledge has the same form factor and rigidity as a single portaledge so anything you can do in a standard single ledge~ you can do in this ledge according to the reports from those that have actually used one,Jan 2007,Dec 30 2019,0
6551,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,3,16, It’s actually way more comfy to sit with your back against the wall because there is no rigid bar digging into the back of your knee. There was also “recliner mode” in the prototype that I saw. That was luxurious. We will have to see if that feature will be available in the final design. I’m not sure why someone  would be “hanging out” and not climbing or sleeping. I would rather make it to a huge ledge faster~ eat~ and sleep on something that is actually comfortable. Rigid ledges don’t provide that.,Feb 2009,Dec 30 2019,0

I also want to send out a huge thanks to those who emailed me and offered to swap their backer numbers with mine which undoubtedly allowed for this to happen.

6580,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,5,5, I received some answers to my questions direct from G7: 1) There are no instructions currently but a manual might be in the works? 2) The ledges can be stored in their bags~ white lining out~ and they haven't had problems with durability in their testing. 3) You can use your breath to fill the inflation bags and then roll that air into the ledges. The bags themselves trap the majority of moisture in your breath and they haven't had problems with moisture in the ledges. The ledges should be stored with the valves open. 4) When setting up ledges side-by-side~ they can be connected at the head~ center~ and foot suspension fins using the small webbing loops and cutouts in the fins. The loops can be joined together~ through the cut out holes~ with a carabiner that serves as a cotter pin. I'll try to upload a picture. 5) When setting up the ledges in bunk config~ the bottom ledge attaches to the center suspension points of the top ledge at the sewn daisy loop. 6) The loop of webbing that passes under the center of the ledge can be used for hanging a pack or poop or whatever. 7) The daisy chain loops at the top of the suspension are used for fine tuning the leveling of the ledges; bigger adjustments must be made by incorporating carabiners or quickdraws.,Jun 2001,Jan 8 2020,4

6585,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,5,10, Why would you blow up the inflation bag by mouth and then roll that air into the ledge?   Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of the inflation bag? Dunno~ but my reason: filling the inflation bag with breath is pretty easy~ then rolling the bag is a way to generate lots of pressure to get the ledges firm. I couldn't generate enough pressure with just my lungs to fill the ledges directly.,Jun 2001,Jan 8 2020,0

6587,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,5,12, I found the draw cord on the inflation bag to be key. Just don’t think it will withstand a shit load of reps. Maybe but check out the video I made on it. Thoughts?m.youtube.com/watch?v=DHHiL…;t=10s,May 2015,Jan 8 2020,0
6588,G7 Pod Portaledge...

I couldn't generate enough pressure with just my lungs to fill the ledges directly. I've now inflated the ledge with breath twice~ once on the ground and once from a free hang. I did this because the inflation bag is less than ideal and was he'll on my forearms.  I found that it's easy to use lung pressure to get the ledge completely full while the bag is not able to reach the same level of pressure for the final inflation cycles. ,Jan 2007,Jan 8 2020,2

6590,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,5,15, I think you guys are inflating the bag wrong then. I’ll post a video~ but you just blow a quick breath at the open bag and then it (the inflation sack) inflated fully. Then I just pinch off the end and kind of smashed it to push in the air~ I didn’t roll it every time. Ones it pops off~ add a few breaths directly into the pods (That is what I saw Nathan~ the inventor of this thing do). Otherwise it might be too soft for side laying or on the stomach too.,Feb 2009,Jan 8 2020,1

6604,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,6,9, I'm backer #35; support told me I'm shipping in the next batch~ likely this week.  I think the first pods shipped only two weeks ago (?)~ and given that many backers chose two or more pods~ based on the goal of shipping batches of 20-30 per week they seem to be on target... Given the challenges of bringing a first product to market and the apparent quality and meticulousness seen in the unboxing videos~ I'd say I'm pretty happy with the progress.  Also support responded to my request to update my shipping address really quickly and helpfully.,Oct 2017,Jan 11 2020,3

6621,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,7,6, FYI~ My buddy and I are backers #180 and #190~ and we both received our pods yesterday. I'm impressed with the ease of inflation with the inflation bag. No need to use any breath if you don't want to. Just hold the bag open~ cinch the drawstring quickly and start rolling. I agree with another poster that it seems like the storm shelter wall-side could potentially be the first thing to get damaged/ripped~ as it is not the most durable material~ and will be rubbed/pinched between rock and pad. Otherwise~ I'm impressed with the whole system. Can't wait to get out and use it!,Jul 2012,Feb 5 2020,0

6631,G7 Pod Portaledge... It's released. ,7,16, Perhaps so that you can cook on your ledge or move around slightly? Or perhaps to use it somewhere where the temps may get below freezing? I'll be honest~ I thought this was a joke when I first saw it. Looking at it a bit more~ I can see that it can have some uses at some times~ but it certainly does not replace the utility of a regular ledge. Anyone cooking on a portaledge without a hanging stove is doing it wrong.   Also~ a regular ledge is definitely no warmer than this.  A regular ledge is just one piece of fabric between you and the elements.  ,Nov 2006,May 19 2020,0

Blew it up during the day when the temps were around 50F.  I was warm without an additional pad and no deflation overnight. Only issue (which would be an issue with any ledge) was rolling against the side flaps which compressed my sleeping bag and created a cold spot that would wake me up. ,Jan 2007,May 19 2020,1

6645,Rappel Devices,1,7, I don't think a single piranha will repel much. You need at least a small school of piranhas~ and then you have to be okay with the death of the thing you're repelling. There's also significant risk dealing with flesh-eating fish. The Juul wil probably work to repel humans--most people don't like vapers. You'd need a particularly pungent vape juice to repel other species~ and remember that in order for the repulsive effects of vaping to work you actually have to vape. I'd say this method also has major downsides~ but it's probably better than the piranha. EDIT: Serious answer: the mega jul is frankly terrible for rappelling. The pirana is probably better--I haven't specifically used that device but I've used similar devices. That said~ I doubt your use case requires such a large~ heavy~ expensive device--the pirana is intended for canyoneering situations with a wide variety of friction conditions. 95% of rappelling situations would be handled better by an ATC XP~ which is a little over half the weight~ and less than half the price.,Jan 2017,May 20 2020,6

6648,Rappel Devices,1,10," what do you want out of a rap device? the mega jul is a *great* device for the right person in the right scenario.  Mostly alpine or whenever you want a really light device that can do it all (rap~ assisted brake~ guide mode) but it absolutely sucks in locking rap mode~ I use mine turned around in ""standard tuber mode"" with a prussic so as a rap device it is no better than an ATC and maybe worse as it can't do some of the ascending tricks for self rescue that a atc guide can do.  When i'm cragging I belay with a grigri~ but I love my mega jul for alpine or weight savings on multipitch. Are you only rappelling?  whats the application~ if you're talking caving for example you will likely wear out a standard atc very fast and may need a ""rack"" or a ""stop"" (I think those are the right names I don't cave) If you are just rapping of cliffs and not climbing then any ATC and prussic are fine~ don't overthink it~ learn the basics and how to use standard stuff before getting fancy. If you are climbing the part where you belay with the device or use it in guide mode should be the main concern~ not the rappelling (imo mega jul is ok in guide mode with ropes 9.6 or less~ but has more friction than a BD ATC guide for example) The only thing I would not buy for rappelling is an ""8"" that's some old school right there.",Apr 2015,May 20 2020,1

6660,Rappel Devices,2,1, Unfortunately you’ve tapped into some the “personalities” on MP by misspelling rappel. The best device for rapping in a canyon won’t be the same one used on a crag or in the mountains or on ice. To ask the question of climbers who mostly use that device for belaying is one of the reasons you’re getting all the sarcasm. Even when you pin down exactly what you’re going to use it for~ you’re still going to get different opinions. So many options out there- single rope~ double rope~ fat~ skinny~ auto braking~ assisted braking~ guide mode features etc. Assuming you are new to the sport~ the best advice is get with an instructor or mentor and have them show you why the choice is so activity dependent. Then you will be able to make a better choice. ,Jan 2013,May 20 2020,3
6661,Miura vs TC pro vs Kataki asym?,1,0, I've used TC pros for years~ forefoot shape/fit is pretty good~ though slightly wide. I've used Miuras~ they are a bit too asymmetrical for my toe alignment.  Slight gap next to big toe~ sole not really under the toe. How is Kataki forefoot shape/symmetry/under the big toe relative to TC and miuras?,Mar 2009,May 20 2020,0
6662,Miura vs TC pro vs Kataki asym?,1,1, Are you talking Miura vs or lace? Kataki have very asymetrical forefoot. They are also being discontinued. I have very low volume foot and currently wear Miura lace womens in 39.5. Have kataki womans in 40 that are maybe too comfortable. Single pitch tcpro for me is 39. They stretch a good bit.,Nov 2017,May 20 2020,1

6664,Miura vs TC pro vs Kataki asym?,1,3, They have the same PD75 last (vs PD55 for Katana lace & TC Pro) so should have similar asymmetry. But since the toe box is so different~ they won't feel similar for the big toe.,Jul 2006,May 20 2020,1
6665,Miura vs TC pro vs Kataki asym?,1,4, I have both the Katana Lace and Kataki.  The Kataki has a pointed big toe~ which makes it good for thin cracks.  The Katana has a standard toe box more similar to the TC Pro.  Never tried the Miuras.,Apr 2011,May 20 2020,1
6666,Miura vs TC pro vs Kataki asym?,1,5, Because the toe box on Miura lace give less room for small toes they have the feel of being more symetrical which I prefer. Better feel when back edging.

6670,Miura vs TC pro vs Kataki asym?,1,9, OK~ So I am reading miura and kataki same asym~ but sorry~ what's different about the toe box? Kataki has a low volume toe box so if you size them for flatter toes it'll have much better support than Miura Lace. But if you've never tried Katana Lace you should (the woman's Kataki would be narrower but also softer) considering both Kataki models are discontinued.,Jul 2006,May 20 2020,1

Miura lace for me had air over the toes~ so flatter fit may be better. EDIT: now I remember~ Katana lace downturn was too much for my hallux rigidus.

6672,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,0, Over the past 1.5 years~ I’ve now somehow destroyed 2 inflatable sleeping pads. One was an Xtherm and the other was an Uberlite. I’m relatively careful with them~ but obviously not careful enough. What robust options are you folks using? Do you prefer closed cell? ,Mar 2016,May 17 2020,0
6673,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,1, I've settled on a full length CCF + torso length Prolite for climbing. Not as light but burly. I can't sleep on CCF alone on a hard surface personally~ but at least I won't freeze if the Prolite gives up. Prolites are tougher than NeoAirs IMO~ and easier to repair in the field (flat surface). Heavier and less packable though~ no free lunch.  NeoAirs are awesome for comfort/weight until they don't work. Still use them backpacking. ,Sep 2013,May 17 2020,1
6674,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,2, (You may have known this already~ but I just want to point out that you can patch holes/tears in inflatable sleeping pads pretty easily) I own a bunch of different style pads~ including a Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest SOLight (closed cell).  Here's why you should buy one of these puppies: -Dirt cheap -Effective at insulating you from the cold ground -Essentially indestructible: throw it on sharp stuff~ walk all over it~ the worst that's gonna happen is the silvery stuff starts to flake off a little -fairly light~ especially if you get a short model that only covers head-to-thigh and find some other way to pad your legs The downsides: -bulky: you are pretty much forced to strap this to the outside of your pack if backpacking -not plush: try these out at your local REI~ they are not super comfy. If you want comfort you should add something else under it like your rope/pack/second thin pad/etc An added bonus if you're road-tripping or car camping: cover your cooler with it during the drive; it reflects the sun off and creates more insulation to keep your ice from melting so fast in a hot car.,Oct 2017,May 17 2020,4
6675,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,3, I have a bunch of different ones. I have two Big Agnes ones that I have used extensively~ a QCore and a QCore SLX~ both pack small~ are insulated~ and have been used in 4 season conditions. I usually pair them with a ZLite because having a closed cell to sit on in the winter is crucial and it serves as a backup in case the air mattresses do pop. I also have an Exped Downmat which is finicky to inflate and heavier and smaller than the Big Agnes' I have. It's got a much tougher fabric and down insulation~ but I'd still never go anywhere without my ZLite.,Aug 2016,May 17 2020,1
6676,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,4, For 70 grams~ this little pad will add a lot of durability to whatever lightweight pad you choose:https://www.gossamergear.com/products/thinlight-foam-pad Also~ Thermarest has a great warranty. If the issues were user error~ they will still do a professional repair for a small fee~ which I think is very reasonable.,Aug 2014,May 17 2020,1
6677,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,5, I use a z lite~ never gonna pop cuz its foam~ and if you fold it in half~ you get great comfort and insulation for the torso~ and the legs go on your empty pack~ it's more comfy than you'd think.,Mar 2016,May 17 2020,1
6678,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,6, I have used an insulated Klymit pad for years~ and it hasn't let me down. After 3 years or so it got a very slow leak (still mostly inflated in the morning)~ and Klymit replaced it with a brand new one for free. Can't recommend enough.,Feb 2017,May 17 2020,0
6679,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,7, Chris~ out of curiosity where are you getting holes in your pads?  I don't use those particular pads but am definitely concerned about my inflatable leaking on an alpine route.  I have used a Zlite for alpine climbing in the past~ but have had several really cold nights sleeping on snow so I am planning on pairing it with an air pad (S2S) for upcoming routes. I'd be kinda scared to use the Uberlite~ it has ridiculously thin fabrics in the name of saving weight (it's 15D top and bottom~ Xtherm is 30D/70D~ S2S is 30D/40D).  I love light stuff but I think there's a limit...,Mar 2015,May 17 2020,0
6680,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,8, I like my Zlite paired with a Neoair All Season for most objectives~ good balance or weight~ versatility~ comfort and durability. That said~ in winter I skip the Zlite for an old school 3/8 Closed cell foam pad. The smooth surface doesn’t hold snow in all divots like a Zlite does. And any snow brushes off much easier. If you are inside a tent with a floor it’s less of an issue~ but I find no downside to the Evazote type pad. Bonus~ I got my favorite one at a New Zealand thrift shop for $5nz.,Aug 2011,May 17 2020,2

6683,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,11, I have a thermarest prolite that I've had for years~ I had 2 rei branded equivalents before but they eventually became not air tight but had no holes (dunked in a tub to check)  I think the laminate wore out so I switched to the name brand.  My thermarest was great until my girlfriend borrowed it and put her ice axe through it or something.  I sewed the hole closed and blobbed rubber cement on it and then glued 2 layers of patches over that~ 1 patch bigger than the other (I think I used tenacious tape).  That was 2 years ago and its still going strong~ patch still holding obviously the foam pads are more durable.  Personally I avoid the popular super thick new style balloon pads as they take forever to inflate and if they do pop give you nothing~ at least the old style thermarest has a little foam inside.  It seems that most people disagree with me here though.,Apr 2015,May 17 2020,0

6688,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,16, Used to have the same issue until I cut an old closed cell foam pad (ridge rest)~ about a 3-4 ft piece~ that covers my hips to shoulders.

6690,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,18, The mold thrives on moisture so yes~ inflating by mouth will eventually result in a leaky pad. The better sleeping pads have an anti-microbial treatment inside which reduces the chance of this happening. Storing the pad unrolled with the valve open~ in a dry environment also helps~ if this is an option. There are a couple of storage sacks on the market that turn into inflators~ which reduces or eliminates the moisture getting into the pad. ,Jul 2005,May 19 2020,1
6691,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,1,19, The Xtherm for the most part is welded together~ I would imagine. Maybe the inner baffles will get damaged after prolonged use~ but the outer casing welded.

6697,Sick of popping sleeping pads!,2,4, It all depends on where I am and what I'm doing. In Alaska~ I almost always end up sleeping on so much duff that a foam pad is all I need. Or I'm on my packraft. In the High Sierras I sleep on a lot more rock~ and that inflatable is much more comfortable. My gf has put holes in 2 REI pads~ I've got over a hundred on a Klymit and similar on a Thermarest without any issues. Be careful about what you do with them~ especially if you're in a situation where not having insulation matters. Usually it's just less comfortable. ,May 2016,May 20 2020,0

6699,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,0, New Wild Country Zero friends are due out March-ish timeframe and I was fortunate enough to receive a set for testing. Picked them up last week so have limited time on them~ but wanted to share some opening thoughts and see if people have questions that I can answer~ or certain types of placements I can show while I test them. Open thoughts: Stiffness is somewhere in the middle between an X4 and an alien~ which is where I'd like to see it. The width of the heads is awesome! See photos below. Very easy to place. Please let me know what you guys would like to see!,Apr 2010,Nov 11 2019,21
6700,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,1, what is the smallest unit comparable to? do they have rating strength written on the sling? can you compare the flexibility with x4's and totems for horizontal placements? any obvious concerns as to durability?,Aug 2013,Nov 11 2019,0
6701,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,2," It is a shame they changed how the cable attaches to the head. The old Zeros had a flexible cable which ran all the way to the head~ instead of that 1"" or less stiff piece of steel you see on the new ones. As a result~ the old Zeros would likely hold better in a fall where the direction of pull was not perfectly aligned with the placement~ such as when a cam rotates or more so when the cam is placed in a small pod. Given that~ combined with the small head-width~ is what really set Zeros apart from the competition~ it is unfortunate to see them take away one of those key features. Now it is just another small cam.",Apr 2006,Nov 11 2019,5
6702,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,3, Wade have you used the Dragonflys to compare?  Wondering about the stiffness.  I have the smallest three DFs and like them but the smallest two are rather flimsy feeling.  Not much a concern so far but more curious than anything. Also one of the things I enjoy about DMM cams in general is how smooth and pleasant the action is (even though that's such a superficial thing to judge on).  How do the Zeros feel?,Jun 2016,Nov 11 2019,1
6703,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,4, The best thing you could do for this thread and your fellow climber is lend them out. Let us test them ourselves no?

6704,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,5, Why are you comparing the red Zero to the black totem? Is the red really that big? I assumed it was a 0.1 size. Also~ I'm down with a deposit-rental-demo deal too haha,Jun 2013,Nov 11 2019,5

6713,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,14, Excited to compare these with the new BD Z4s. Both have small head width~ BD has the rigid-flex stem going~ but I do like the WC extendable sling. I'm leaning toward Z4s. What are your thoughts?,Mar 2018,Nov 12 2019,6

6715,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,16, LOL. I was surprised to see Plaidman doing this when Totems were first introduced (he went to Yosemite with a bunch and loaned them out to anyone who stepped up and asked). As far as I know everyone returned them after taking them out. ,Mar 2006,Dec 1 2019,2
6716,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,1,17, Any updates on your experiences with these? Their range is enormous~ which seems to confirm the crazy camming angle (17.6°). If that's right~ it is the largest on the market by a good margin - closest would be aliens at ~16°~ I believe~ which they balance by using softer metal for the lobes. Have you taken some falls on them? How is their holding power with such an aggressive angle? Are the lobes extremely soft/any concerns about durability? ,Sep 2011,Jan 5 2020,4

6744,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,4, @ Everyone... I'm aware that placing them as a nut is stupid.

6745,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,5, I climbed on the Zero Friends back in December and thought they were the best finger size pieces I've ever placed.  Nice and stiff when placing.  A little more confident inspiring with the metal stem cover vs platic on the Z4s.  Both felt about the same to place~ but the Zero Friends were sooooo grabby~ esp with tred on the lobes.  Hook your boy up~ Wade!!,Sep 2018,Feb 21 2020,2

6755,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,15, I picked up the .1 and .2 Zero Friends a few days ago (haven’t climbed on them yet)~ and I noticed something interesting about their ranges that I figured I’d point out. I also have the equivalent size Z4s and Dragonflies~ which I’ll be comparing them to. Here are the listed ranges for the Z4s and DFs of these sizes:Z4s:.1: 8.8 - 13.8.2: 10.4 - 16.3DFs:Red: 8.7 - 12.9Yellow: 10.2 - 15.2I picked these cams up because~ according to the chart earlier in this thread~ they went a bit smaller than the equivalent Z4s or DFs~ and I consider that very small difference in range to be useful at certain times. However~ when I got the cams I noticed that the listed ranges were different than those in the aforementioned chart:,Apr 2019,Apr 19 2020,12
6756,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,16, Can you please post a pic of a z4 .2 vs a wild country friend equivalent?  Id like to see the head width and length side my side,Apr 2014,Apr 19 2020,0
6757,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,17, No problem. Here are some more comparison pictures. For the head width pictures~ I did my best to line the cams up based on their total head width~ including the axles sticking out beyond the lobes. The head widths of the Z4s and Zero Friends are basically the same from what I can tell.,Apr 2019,Apr 20 2020,6
6758,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,18, Thanks dude~ this is very helpful.  I'm having a hard time determining any advantage that the DF and WC have over the Z4.  If you care about weight as well~ the Z4 is 10g on average lighter per cam.  How is the WC trigger?  Looks relatively flat...I feel like a little grove (like Z4 and DF) helps you control it better.  Any issues? It does look like the .2 and .1 WC do have a slightly lower min range than the Z4.,Apr 2014,Apr 20 2020,0
6759,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,3,19, No problem. I still haven’t climbed on them~ but just playing around with the cams~ the trigger seems fine and the lack of a groove doesn’t seem like it would be an issue. If I had to only own one cam in these sizes~ I’d pick the Z4. IMO the advantage of the other two is the extendable sling (if you like that). Additionally~ the DFs are much more flexible than the ZF and Z4~ and they should have the most theoretical holding power due to the lower cam angle. For the ideal doubles in these sizes~ I’d go with the ZF and Z4~ mainly because the ranges are the most different~ while the DF sits in between. Also the smaller head width is really nice.,Apr 2019,Apr 20 2020,3
6760,Wild Country Zero Friends Review,4,0, Just to post my two cents... I have the .3 and .4~ previously I have used the mastercams and TCU in these sizes so those are my references.  These things are awesome!! Build quality feels really nice~ and trigger action is lovely. Head width is a fair bit thinner than the TCU and a little narrower than the mastercam. I just took my first fall on one~ a somewhat undercammed .3 in a VERY shallow horrizontal at Yellow Bluff (think fairly soft sandstone). The fall was about ten feet and the cam held perfectly. Slight link in the stem that I was able to bend back by hand. ,Feb 2015,May 19 2020,9

6764,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,0, I got the Smart and I've found the autoblock on rappel works too well!  Thing is jerky as hell and that's even with a wider~ more gradual radius on the locker (note~ you can't even use a sharper radius head on your locker because it won't fit around the wide profile of the device). Just want to get some possible thoughts on whether I'm doing something wrong.  Does the meja jull rap much cleaner but still provide the backup on rap as well?  As I said~ the locking on rap for sure works with the smart and is quite a comforting feeling (not that I enjoy taking my brake hand off).  Thanks,Dec 2012,May 18 2020,0
6765,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,1, The smart does take getting used to on rappel. I remember seeing somewhere a suggestion that you can flip it and feed in the rope differently and get a rappel without the autoblock that feeds a lot smoother. ,Oct 2018,May 18 2020,0
6766,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,2, The smart is sort of awful~ relative to the megajul anyways. It's so big and clunky and also jerky AF~ generally overdesigned. The megajul can be easily flipped for a normal~ non auto-blocking rappel (great feature and pretty intuitive)~ if you choose to use the brake-assist it is also a little jerky~ but actually works pretty well on slightly shorter ropes. I pref backwards with a 3rd hand/friction hitch for long/big raps but that's me.,Nov 2012,May 18 2020,0
6767,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,3, Do not extend the megajul for rappel!!!! But flipped and off your belay loop it pretty much becomes an ATC,Oct 2016,May 18 2020,0

6770,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,6, Maybe I should have put more time into it but the gigajul seemed like a lot of machine~ and was a little bit too grippy/jerky.

6772,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,8, I've found that the Smart Alpine is highly sensitive to extending it to the right length and getting it to a placement where I can easily push up on the lever. Once I figured that out I was much happier on long rappels. Basically you want to end up with it right in front of your shoulder. ,Jan 2016,May 18 2020,1
6773,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,9, Do you mean: don't extend when flipped? Or just when it is faced forward? I could see it being harder to put into a jug system if you pass a rap or whatever if extended with flip i guess... If it's flipped~ it's basically impossible to switch to a jug system.  When it is backwards it locks when you try to pull slack through to ascend.  For that reason I wouldn't use a flipped megajul if I was the first to rappel on a multipitch and there is a chance of missing the next anchor.  In single pitch or if your partner has already found the next anchor~ then no problem.,Aug 2014,May 18 2020,0
6774,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,10, Just use Alpine Smart off your belay loop and it works fine. Test it before you trust it and disconnect your tether.,Jul 2015,May 18 2020,4
6775,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,11, There’s some technique to it~ you have to find the right balance between opening the device vs. brake hand pressure. I find it’s smoothest when I open it until I am mostly controlling my speed with my brake hand. ,Oct 2017,May 18 2020,2
6776,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,12, Just flip the Smart so the lever faces you~ this turns it into a normal ATC. Extend and use a prusik just like normal!,Feb 2015,May 18 2020,1
6777,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,13, Ya this makes the most sense.  Just based on the physics~ rapping with these devices on your belay loop will get you the most braking force since your CG is nearest to the bend in the strands. Extending is kinda a pain in the ass tho.   I could see the gigajul having the same issue simply because to achieve any auto blocking force on a device you need your body weight to be doing the braking.   ,Dec 2012,May 18 2020,0

Could you explain this? Couldn't you hang on a prussic above the device~ tie into a fig8 on a bite beneath the device as a backup~ then just flip the device and start jugging?,May 2013,May 18 2020,1
6779,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,15, I’ve been using a gigajul for a while now and really like it. Rappelling 20 pitches in the dark isn’t a problem.  Really intuitive and works just like an ATC but with steel wear plates. ,May 2015,May 18 2020,2
6780,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,1,16, Ya I definitely tinkered with it for a few raps.  It almost seemed less secure trying to find the correct balance of lever push up to move expediently yet under control.  I imagine gloves would help~ but not thats very alpine. Basically~ it seems about 5x easier with an ATC to find the sweet spot and I'd think easier to correct if you lost control (assuming you didnt let go).  Then again~ if you freak with the smart~ just letting go is better than just letting go on an atc....,Dec 2012,May 18 2020,0

Couldn't you hang on a prussic above the device~ tie into a fig8 on a bite beneath the device as a backup~ then just flip the device and start jugging? Yeah~ but with an extended rappel + flipped device + friction hitch beneath the device~ you'd have to be able to reach above your extended device to make a second hitch and transfer body weight to the upper hitch~ then what you said would follow. Big pain. If you rap on one of these in ""assist"" mode you only need add a hitch above the device and start jugging.

6787,Mammut Smart vs Mega Jul on Rappel,2,2, Hmmmm. When I rappel I use a tether to tie into my rap anchor.

6792,Tendon Smartlite Safety Issue,1,2, Different ropes have different characteristics in handling.  I have some that are fairly stiff or at least feel pretty robust but others like my Trango Catalyst feels super soft and squishy and also feels like falling on a bungee chord which is pretty nice a most times.   Even though its much softer I trust it as much as any other rope I have.   I wouldn't worry about it.,Apr 2012,May 18 2020,0
6793,Tendon Smartlite Safety Issue,1,3, I have a Tendon Master 9.4 and it feels just like any other rope~ it’s actually one of the better handling ropes I have used. The Smart Lite is their “budget” rope so maybe you have to accept a bit of squishiness but it should be perfectly safe. ,Oct 2017,May 18 2020,0

6799,Suggestions Please,1,5, The prussik needs to be smaller than the main~ which would mean a 5mm backup~ and who wants a 5mm backup? Also the thinner the main the harder it is to control. This seems like a way to get hurt. Typically you want a prussik diameter 20% smaller than the main line. With 10mm ropes people go with 8mm for prussiks~ but 7mm works fine too. But for a 6mm main line~ all you can really use is a 5mm prussik. It has to do with the bend radius of the rope. It has to be able to wrap more tightly than the diameter of the main line. Imagine trying to use a 10mm prussik on a 6mm main. It obviously wouldn't work.,May 2019,May 18 2020,1

Also - lots of the routes in the creek are very long. Sadly~ I dont think a double rack will usually get you there (unless you're a very competent crack climber) - get with friends and pool your gear. I've been on 140ft routes in the creek where I carried 20+ cams... I'd say a double rack of .75 to #3 with maybe even triples of #2 and #3 and you could def use a #4 (or 2) for wider stuff...

6826,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,1,7," I recently was using~ and was very happy with~ the Fitbit Charge 3.  Except for outdoors~ and except when it mattered. To get a good HR reading it needs to be snug on your wrist which caused some mild discomfort.  Indoors~ I could manage with that.  Outdoors~ I couldn't~ and after enough times of hanging out on the rock face~ looking at a hand jam and fiddling to take off the tracker I started looking for an alternative. With lockdown I've not used my alternative~ but it's this~ and I'll *provisionally* recommend the same for you.https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/oh1-optical-heart-rate-sensor It's optical (arguably less accurate~ but more comfortable than a chest strap)~ but goes high on your arm so should be well out of the way of hand jams and the like. It works standalone (offload data later)~ or with bluetooth (send data to your phone) and also ant+ (send data to a fitness watch). I looked at the TICKR stuff.  The chest straps feel edit to add: feels like it would be  too uncomfortable in general (caveat: never worn one~ so I might be wrong)~ and their arm strap doesn't store data locally. If you want cheap~ the polar strap by itself could be your thing.  If you want extra functionality~ get a fitness watch (garmin instinct perhaps) to pair with it. Edit to add: read this for arm band comparisons -- https://www.clevertraining.com/blog/scosche-rhythm-24-vs-wahoo-tickr-fit-vs-polar-oh1/  I also went with the polar as it was the only one with a stated preference for wearing on the upper arm~ not lower arm.  Note the firmware updated ""OH1+"" now has ant+ connectivity.",Jan 2015,May 12 2020,0

6845,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,2,5, Training based on heart rate zones. For the aerobic activity associated with climbing~ I.e running~ hiking~ approaches etc maybe~ but for rock climbing I don’t see the utility of heart rate zones. The muscle groups taxed while climbing are likely too small to cause the  significant changes to heart rate as is the case with the large muscle groups used for aerobic exercise. Even in cycling (I raced at a fairly high level for over 15 years)~ HR based training is only marginally useful. HR fluctuates with temperature~ fatigue~ stress~ etc...not a great objective measure. Power based training has largely replaced HR based training. HR has some utility to see that your aerobic numbers are in alignment with what your power numbers are telling you and that your perceived exertion matches your HR/power. For rock climbing~ I’d imagine your forearms will be pumped and anaerobic long before your heart rate would give you any indication. The muscle group is relatively small compared to large leg muscles~ so the heart is probably not the limiting factor in determining whether you are aerobic/anaerobic.  I doubt that measuring HR is going yield useful zones that will tell you whether your forearm muscles are aerobic / threshold / anaerobic. ,Dec 2009,May 12 2020,1
6846,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,2,6, For the aerobic activity associated with climbing~ I.e running~ hiking~ approaches etc maybe~ but for rock climbing I don’t see the utility of heart rate zones. The muscle groups taxed while climbing are likely too small to cause the  significant changes to heart rate as is the case with the large muscle groups used for aerobic exercise.  Agreed with this. Coupled with other inputs beyond muscular fatigue spiking HR for climbing~ can't imagine the data is that worthwhile. Unless you're Honnold who has said if his heart rate is elevated~ something is wrong...or getting laps on a route / auto-bae well within your climbing limit to get miles on rock at an endurance HR...but I'd still argue that HR isn't the best tool here.,Jan 2019,May 12 2020,1

6858,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,2,18, Wahoo tickr (the tickr is a chest strap) is probably your best bet for the functionality and the cost. It is accurate if you have good connectivity. Mine is a little buggy when it gets cold and I am running. I've noticed it has to be pretty damn cold while not wear a lot of insulating layers. It will spike or get stuck on a heart rate and I have to periodically hold my hand over the device and warm it up to get it to get it to read accurately. Despite all that I would still recommend it. It is bluetooth and ant+. I have also tried out the tickr fit (the arm based optical device) and it is accurate enough. Definitely more so than the Garmin wrist based optical heart rate.

6870,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,3,10, I thought the HR training advocates' argument was that HR is a better objective measure for exactly the reasons you mention.  In other words~ the specific physiological adaptations your training is trying to induce are better correlated with HR than~ e.g.~ power. Not that I really train anymore~ but my goal was always to have perceived exertion~ HR~ and power all line up. I used PE and HR for the reasons you mention. They were a guide for whether hitting a power target was reasonable or I was having fatigue problems. Yes~ if fatigue was a factor then lowering the power targets or scrapping/re-scheduling certain workouts altogether was an option. Also useful as a guide for tapers~ i.e. Perceived exertion is low and HR slightly lower than expected for power targets. But ultimately I (and pretty much anyone else I knew) used power as the guide for training targets~ because once you’re racing that is all that matters~ not your HR.,Dec 2009,May 14 2020,1
6871,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,3,11, TLDR: Only buy a chest strap electrical HR monitor for climbing. I think cardio matters a little.   Here is a very typical session for me at the climbing gym.

6874,Heart rate monitor: whats the cheapest most functional option,3,14, This is pure speculation~ and I'm just a layperson in this area~ but maybe the spikes in your HR when climbing and bouldering are a psychological reaction as well as a physical one? Of course gym climbing and bouldering are physically demanding activities~ but they also require you to be highly alert~ focused and attentive. And there's also the fear of falling~ at least in my case. All that psychological stress evokes a fight-or-flight reaction that sends adrenaline through your system and causes your heart rate to spike. (It also causes your pupils to dilate~ and your muscles to react more quickly). In my experience it's quite different with high-intensity aerobic activities~ such as running fast uphill. Those sort of activities don't cause a sudden HR spike~ at least not over the course of a few seconds. It's more of a gradual increase over several minutes~ and an equally gradual decline when you stop.,Jul 2003,May 14 2020,2

6926,Chains for bolted anchor,1,0, What kind of chains do you use for a bolted anchor? I climbed a route a few months ago where the bolted anchor could really use a chain to extend it a bit to reduce friction when pulling the rope. I likely wouldn't modify it without talking to the person who bolted the route~ but if I was going to~ could I just get some heavy duty chain from a hardware store? ,Oct 2018,May 17 2020,0

6928,Chains for bolted anchor,1,2, If Petzl or BD had their own line of chain~ there would be plenty of folks claiming that anything else would be dangerous. But good chain is crazy strong~ with loads-in-use far~ far exceeding anything climbers ever exert on their system. The notion that a beefy commercial chain is inadequate for bodyweight (rap anchor) is absurd. The only question - stainless or not?,Jul 2009,May 17 2020,4
6929,Chains for bolted anchor,1,3," I would also suggest grabbing a few 1/2"" quick links.  One for each end of the chain to thread your rope through and reduce the wear on your chain.  Sometimes I'll get a longer chain to attach both bolts to instead of just one on each bolt.  This makes for a bomber anchor.  If you install quicklinks at the bottom of the chain be sure to count your links to make it equalized and lay correctly against the rock.  The bigger quick links make it easier to pull your rope through. Use the same metal as the chain you purchase.  Don't mix your metals.  If the anchor bolts are plate steel then you should follow suit.  If they are stainless then go stainless.  In my opinion adding chain to an anchor for top rope~ lowering or rappelling isn't that big of a deal ""to modify"" the route.  Thanks for being  a good steward of the rock.",Nov 2010,May 17 2020,2
6930,Chains for bolted anchor,1,4," No one will complain if you go all stainless. But putting non-SS links at the rope end of the chains is OK - these are the replaceable pieces. Also~ if there is any true galvanic corrosion (unlikely in most locations)~ the more active steel will effectively protect the non-replaceable parts (the concept of ""sacrificial anode""). The lower cost is just a nice side benefit~ but shouldn't drive your hardware decisions~ of course.",Jul 2009,May 17 2020,0
6931,Chains for bolted anchor,1,5, 1 common thing is a 3/8 stainless quicklink on the bolt attached to plated 5/16 or 3/8 chain and a 3/8 plated quick link on the bottom of the chain (especially if you use 5/16 chain) this way there is a stainless piece touching the stainless hanger~ but you save $$ on the chain~ if/when it gets rusty I can easily be replaced~ and if it transfers rust to the stainless quick link it wont damage the hanger and the stainless link can be swapped out. Many people skip the stainless quicklink and go all plated~ in most areas I have not seen problems with this personally.,Apr 2015,May 17 2020,1
6932,Chains for bolted anchor,1,6," No one will be pissed at you for adding chains to an anchor and saving everyone rope wear.  Do it! As people have said~ 3/8"" zinc plated chain is good~ most carabiners fit through that size chain.",Oct 2017,May 17 2020,1

6934,Chains for bolted anchor,1,8, Another thing to consider: I sometimes come across chain anchors with the wrong amount of links~ so that you have to twist the chain to get your rope through both. It's minor~ but it adds friction and twists to the rope. ,Mar 2006,May 17 2020,0

6951,Will you avoid buying gear made in China now?,1,12," I also think that the bigger issue to many of us on whether to buy local or not is how the manufacturing of those products (and it's delivery to the consumer) impacts the environment (which is very much an issue that I think a lot of climbers care about).  It's one of the reasons that I choose to buy local as much as possible.  I wasn't trying to derail and want to be clear that obviously news coming out of China is deplorable.  I do think that some people tend to put on ""local blinders"" that makes them believe their own country is acting ""less bad"" than others which makes their own moral choices easier to rationalize.  ",May 2011,Oct 8 2019,1

Mind you~ I have no where near the inner strength of the late California climber Galen Rowell~ who showed up in Tibet handing out color photos of the Dali Lama (highly forbidden and you will go to jail if found with it on your possession) Below is from 2008 -still subjugated in 2019: ""Dear Friend~ The time has come for me to go to Tibet again. Last time when I went to Tibet in 1997 - after my graduation - I was arrested by the Chinese authorities~ beaten up~ interrogated~ starved and finally thrown out of Tibet after keeping me in their jails for three months in Lhasa and Ngari. I walked to Tibet~ on my own~ alone~ across the Himalayan Mountains from the Ladakh. Eleven years later~ I am walking to Tibet again; this time too~ without permission. I am returning home; why should I bother about papers from Chinese colonial regime who have not only occupied Tibet~ but also is running a military rule there; making our people in Tibet live in tyranny and brutal suppression day after day~ everyday for fifty years. The Year 2008 is a huge opportunity for the Tibet movement to present the injustices the Tibetans have been subjected to~ when China is going to attract international media attention. I am taking part in the return march from Dharamsala to Tibet~ that is being organized as a part of the ""Tibetan People's Uprising Movement""~ a united effort put together by five major Tibetan NGOs: Tibetan Youth Congress~ Tibetan Women's Association~ Gu-Chu-Sum Movement of Tibet (an association of former political prisoners)~ National Democratic Party of Tibet and Students for a Free Tibet~ India. The march will start on 10 March 2008~ from Dharamsala~ the capital of Tibetan exiles and will pass through Delhi and then head towards Tibet. Walking for six months~ we might reach the Tibet border around the time China opens the Beijing 2008 Olympics (August 14-25). Presently it's too early to approximate at which border point we would be crossing; Tibet and India share a border that runs 4~075 Km along the length of the Himalayas. We might choose any point~ or even multiple points. We'll see the situation. I know there had been similar attempts in the past~ but this is 2008~ and I have seen the organizers working extra hard with strategic planning~ taking care of every minute detail~ and the best thing is that we have all the NGOs working unitedly for the common goal. This unity is our strength! I do not know where we would end up~ that's why I am giving away the little collection of books (my only possession in life) to a library at is being setup in McLeod Ganj~ Dharamsala. My friends: Lobsang and Nyingje (who served in the Indian army as part of the Tibetan battalion) are also giving away their personal belongings; committing themselves for the march. Of course the Indian police will do their duty; the Chinese army at the Tibet border would be overtly enthusiastic. Since we are leading a peaceful march~ with absolute commitment to non-violence~ I do not think anyone - either from Indian authority or Chinese - would impose themselves on us. Inspired by Gandhi's Salt March~ even if they did try to stop us~ we are not stopping. For how many days can they jail us for just walking peacefully? And why should the Indian government stop Tibetan refugees voluntarily returning home on foot? In the past I have climbed buildings to shout for freedom~ thrown myself at the Chinese embassy gate in New Delhi~ spent months in jails~ got beaten up police~ fought court cases~ but I never lost the dignity of the struggle: my believe in Non-violence. The March to Tibet will be non-violent; it is a sadhana~ a spiritual tribute to the truth and justice that we are fighting for. This is our Long March to freedom. And on our journey home~ we will cook and camp in tents on the roadside~ there will be the marchers and the support marchers~ the kitchen team~ logistics~ media and the medical team. There will be dancing and singing~ and theatre and film shows on the road as we take this long journey home. Here is an opportunity to join a historic non-violent freedom struggle~ a people's effort to win freedom for a country that remains subjugated even in 2008. I request you to join us~ support us in whatever ways possible. We need people to know about it~ so spread the word. You can walk with us~ as we walk for six months~ maybe you can join us for a day along the path~ even one hour~ or for a week~ months as a supporter. Schools~ colleges and even whole town can walk with us. We need volunteers~ media people~ writers~ photographers~ bloggers can help us. We need nurses~ cooks~ technicians and your prayers. Ever since the march was announced on 4th January 2008~ Tibetans have been talking about it; it's a major discussion in the refugee camps. Recently the organizers launched the entry form. And I heard people are slowly getting themselves registered. You too can register your volunteer online.

Black Diamond - Used to make in USA -Utah and Oregon now making in like Taiwan Metolius - Some articles are made in USA but much of it will shift to overseas. Misty Mountain - Harnesses made in NC - I have the Cadillac Blue Water Ropes - Made in USA Sterling Ropes - Made in USA CMI - Climbing Gear Just a few~ here is the link I credit the info too. americangearguide.com/ameri…   Aside from all the politics and history of atrocities~ I'm not going down that road because clash of civilizations equal out each other over the course of human history so I feel it a bit uneducated to play the blame game.  I am going to offer some more strategic reasons for buying in the USA~ due to my 20 years in the military I will tell you hands down conflict will never end. If you want to PM me I will have that conversation. As a Vet I don't wrap myself if the flag either. America is not perfect. It has however~ the best chance to become a very respectable country~ in my humble opinion. Back to the point. Why buy in the USA? Because we need to make things as a country to be able to have a stable and robust economy. Hows does rock climbing play into that? Well these companies make money right? Well we want them to hire US workers for one and two we want them to produce in the USA for purposes of control~ meaning US dollars going back into US hands. When a company moves to the CCP controlled economy of China~ the company eventuality is leveraged out of its business. This happens through trade theft and digital theft etc copyright infringement. This isn't new. The Chinese CCP have been in in cohorts with our companies like Apple~ GM~ 3M~ Large Manufacturers~ and of course US politicians and lobby groups i.e. Chamber of Commerce .   This was aided by our own corrupt government R's and D's = Uniparty - yeah thought it was cool to be Left or Right wing - your not really on a side just a useful idiot. How was China aided? First it was the WTO then they soon flew in under NAFTA - they use loopholes through Canada and Mexico.  Okay you might say well why would a company do that. Eventually won't they loose the company? Yep but it won't matter because the share holders and the execs will make millions of dollars and the blue collar worker along with the consumer are the only ones that lose. Guess who buys stock in the new CCP company? Hint its not the machinist or the CAM builder from Black Diamond.  The only way to even try and combat this it to buy local and buy 100% made in USA. This gives us an advantage - local level - National level we need to protect our US Companies and workers with tariffs and penalties i.e. you want to move your production to China its gonna cost you a sin tax for the use of slave labor and a tariff so why bother. Make it painful enough that they won't want to go over there.   1. We buy from responsible companies that hire and take care of their people~ the environment~ etc. etc.  2. Those owners then know who their consumers are and if they don't get greedy (tariffs actually help this) will stay honest to their products - Think dog food made in China remember that one? 3. The items will cost more but that is a good time to think about minimizing - less stuff. My Misty Mountain harness was probably double a BD harness. The quality is unmatched and I know where the money went.  4. The more a company makes and sells its products in the US the more likely they are to give to politicians who are not going to sell us down the river. I know I despise lobbying but its what we have and until enough of us stand up and put a stop to corporate lobbying~ most of what I am relaying here is a pipe dream.  Thanks for reading.

7133,Will you avoid buying gear made in China now?,1,13, True~ but the US~ like Canada~ has a huge built-in advantage when it comes to fighting something like this: lots of relatively low density areas~ which most EU/Asian countries lack. We also have just 1 (or 2 for you) border to manage. So in theory~ we should have it way easier. Canada seems to be stabilizing. Can't say the same for the US. We also both started our outbreaks later than Europe~ so we won't know for a couple of weeks/months if the response was adequate.... not by looking at death rates~ at least. My personal prediction is that some states at least will keep on fumbling the response and that this will remain a low-to-mediums simmering fire for the next few months. Hope I'm wrong. Meaning even IF indeed Canada is putting a lid on it~ we'll remain at risk of further outbreaks coming in from you guys.... EDIT: to follow up~ this is from CBC (our PBS):,Apr 2017,Apr 12 2020,0

7145,Will you avoid buying gear made in China now?,1,5, Yeah. Ultimately~ part our modern problems may just stem from that simple realization (or~ thus far~ failure to realize). It's true that in the West are are generally loath to accept state control over many things. I am not sure if this trait will survive the current pandemic or not. You know~ in  a sense~ WW2 contributed immensely to bloath the size of the government~ created the huge military-industrial complex~ big aerospace etc. Eisenhower talked about that in a great speech soon after WW2 ended. This feels similar to me to today~ in the sense that a crisis precipitated changes in our worldviews as a society compared to before the crisis. The US was loath to intervene in most of the world before WW2. Now look at the map today! Will localism/regionlism of means of production will be one such worldview shift from the current crisis? What about a less materialistic world? What about increased authoritarinism? Or just bigger government? Or just less governement is the judgement is they fucked it up so bad they can't be trusted? I do not presume to have the answers to those questions. But I think things could go in many different ways depending on the next year or two.

7187,Will you avoid buying gear made in China now?,3,7," That's if they actually governed for the society Well~ sure~ but that has nothing to do with the point you quoted. The first part of the point is that~ over decades~ that society has voted for people who got into office. Those people in turn have over time voted laws~ established norms & procedures. Those have in turn shaped the society on which they are enacted (/inflicted). And repeat. It's hard to argue that the society doesn't plays an integral part in that process (e.g. the people~ e.g. among others all those constantly complaining & blaming all sorts of woes on ""government""). The second part of that point is that other sources influences government (e.g. other than votes). Businesses~ various activist organizations~ unions~ journalists~ etc.  But those are also comprised of people~ mostly the same people involved in the circle above. Not a representative sample of society- yet it would be hard to deny that those influential people are not issue of that same society~ have not been influenced in various direct & indirect ways by that society~ and hence reflect at least a part of that society. Thirdly you have other stuff - global forces (such as pandemics~ increasing life expectancy & all sorts of general trends)~ world geopolitics~ luck~ etc. That I guess you could argue the society~ of which I claim the ""government"" is a reflection of~ has little to do with. But then all society are subject to somewhat similar pressure here~ so it would be hard to argue they are the sole distinction between a ""good"" and a ""bad"" government. All not-so-hidden cynicism aside~ seems hard to argue that government aren't to a significant extent reflection of the society from which they arise~ and hence blaming ""the government"" for all woes is somewhat akin to looking at oneself in the mirror & yelling ""you're ugly""...  ",Apr 2017,Apr 20 2020,3

The side of the helmet doesn't cover the temple per say~ but there is a part that angles towards it from your ears that I think would provide a bit of protection.

7226,Small Cams,1,1, I will have to tell you~ BD quit making the C3s but they are one of the best in my opinion. Aliens do very well because they bend multi directional. The purpose of the placement is what determines what cam is best. Because essentially you have offsets and C4s. The Tri cams are unique because of thier width~ side to side. They seem to place better than some C4s. Although I pass up on all of the other brands. Once I get working again I am going to try some of the other brands. DMM Dragonfly and what not. They all work~ no worries. ,Jun 2017,May 17 2020,1

7231,Blancos for trad/cracks,1,1, I think Blancos are very foot shape dependant. I got a pair for thin cracks that curled my toes (very painful in cracks) even though there was an air pocket behind my heel. They have a crazy aggressive upper heel that pushes your whole foot forward. If you have a high volume heel~ I'm sure they're great. I'm pretty sure I saw Tom Randall wearing them on the cobra and Nico favresse wearing them for some of his crazy crack climbs... But if they don't fit your foot they hurt like hell to jam and also won't heel hook for shit. My two cents!,Dec 2018,May 16 2020,0

7240,Sling lengths,1,0, Generally the standard lengths of sewn loop slings are 30cm~ 60cm~ 120cm~ 240cm~ and the rarer 480cm. These have been tried and true lengths but im just curious if anybody thinks it would be worth it for companies to sell other lengths such as a 90cm~ or a 45cm. What lengths would you prefer seeing or is it just too unnecessary?,Sep 2017,May 16 2020,0
7241,Sling lengths,1,1, Sling length matters for two concerns: carrying them~ and using them. For carrying slings~ there are really only three lengths: Less than shoulder length~ shoulder length~ and longer than shoulder length. When using slings~ I don't think finer graduations in available lengths would provide much benefit.,Jul 2019,May 16 2020,5
7242,Sling lengths,1,2, For what its worth~ ik edelrid sells a 90cm version of their aramid sling. I think that's a nice length for that particular sling for flexibility with different size threads and horns and such (where a 60 might not be enough but 120 could be overkill)~ but I dont see how it would be necessarily advantageous for other more common uses for slings.,May 2017,May 16 2020,0
7243,Sling lengths,1,3, Blue water made or makes a 90.  I had 1 it was kinda unnecessary.   Hard to carry.  Too long for shoulder length and too short to double up~ and if done as an alpine draw it hung down too far as well.  ,Apr 2015,May 16 2020,0

7256,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,12, Metolius isn’t even in the same ballpark as more modern cams. They’re good in horizontals~ but trash in pockets~ pin scars and vertical splitters. They really haven’t changed in 25 years~ so what do u expect. I’m surprised they’re still on the market.  I loved the C3’s. Been using them since the day they were released on the market. They’re starting to get worn out now though. Good quality~ with very little issues. The X4’s were trash.  I got the Z4’s the day they were released too and have been abusing the shit out of them with no issues yet. They are a step up from Aliens and as good as the C3’s placement wise. The polymer shroud isn’t an issue either. People just don’t trust it because it looks like cheap plastic~ but they didn’t trust the Glock either and now everyone makes a polymer frame. Jus sayin!  Z4’s and Totem cams as your doubles are the best thing going these days. Z4’s as the workhorse and small placements~ and totems for the funky~ gotta be absolutely bomber placements. ,Sep 2005,May 15 2020,8
7257,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,13, TCUs are NOT amy less durable than C3s. They are at least if not more durable in my experience. Have had a set of both for almost two years~ my TCUs do jabe a little more wear because i tend to rack them first amd only rack the c3’s when i think they will be nice to have on a pitch. And honestly~ the TCUs go into about 97% of the usefull placements that a c3 will. People like the c3s because they have a narrow head coupled with a stiff and narrow body. TCUs have a narrow head with a wider body that will RARELY prevent the cam from going in weird spots. Plus Metolius is a climber owned private company  that assembles the cams in the US and is a reputable company that standa nehind their product Honestly~ I dont even know why people ask these questions when the TCUs have been tried true and readily available for decades.  Also aliens are good(much superior to Metolius mastercams from yellow down~ the lobes on those  are just too narrow for my liking in anything but bullet rock. The TCUs have more contact surface in those sizes and the master cams don’t have the thumb loopthat I like) IMO  to pair with three cam units~ x4~ c4~ and probably z4 Cannot hold a candle to what these cams(tcu/c3 and aliens) can do in the hand of someone climbing something that actually requires cams this specific. Which is very very rare.  The fact is these BD cams ade made for the everyday climber and will work great for that~ but if your pushing it on thin cracks~ there just not designrd specifically enough for that purpose and so fall short when the placements become more irregular and less obvious  Support our economy~ a great local business and the environment by avoiding overseas shipping on some of your fear and buy Metolius.

7258,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,14, This is awesome! Thank you for the insight. I appreciate it. I guess I just need to keep adding more miles onto my Z4s once we can go outside again. ,May 2017,May 15 2020,0
7259,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,15, Whoa! A lot to think about. I for sure will start to add a few of the TCUs onto my rack. I appreciate the feed back! Also totally agree~ support local business!! Thanks for the insight ,May 2017,May 15 2020,0

7261,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,17, Out yesterday with z4s and c3s working a thin seam.  Could not get the z4s to go where the c3s could. In the two smallest of sizes it just makes sense that that wide middle lobe helps make contact.  ,Dec 2010,May 16 2020,0
7262,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,18, Are people talking about the old Metolius TCUs or the new ULMCs? I never used the old TCUs~ but ULMCs are my favorite small cam by far. They are cheap (can be had brand new for $45 with the 25% off sales)~ durable~ snappy~ crazy light~ and are made by a great company with excellent customer service. Sizes #00-#5 are amazing. Above that they get a little floppy. ...and no~ I don’t miss the thumb loop at all. I actually prefer the sans-loop now.,Dec 2016,May 16 2020,1
7263,BD C3s..Any good substitute?,1,19, A friend has a double rack of the ultralight TCUs. I have to say they are much easier to place than the new Z4s. Super solid cam I don't  you would be disapointed with a set of them.,Feb 2017,May 16 2020,1
7264,Another Hiangle sizing thread....yay!,1,0," I'm wanting to try the either of the current Hiangle offerings on the FiveTen site.  I've done some searching and keep seeing sizing advice where people reference the ""old"" hiangles.  I'm not sure if they're talking about the original blue leather~ the gray/yellow synthetic~ or the second version of the blue leather. I have a pair of the synthetics (gray/yellow) in US 11.  It's a perfect fit for indoor bouldering.  I can't find those anymore.  Can anyone recommend a sizing equivalent for the current leather (blue) or the new white synthetics?  Thanks.",Apr 2004,May 2 2020,0

7267,Another Hiangle sizing thread....yay!,1,3, Hey Doug~ I've worn 10.5 in both the old teal (dye your foot blue) and grey/teal (previous model to the current white).  I'm a men's 10 street shoe.  I've always heard the grey/yellow synthetic Hiangles sized the same~ but just didn't stretch.  I boulder and sport climbing in my Hiangles and fit them so they are snug but not bone-crushing.  I'm also just ordered the new (white) Hiangle in both 10.5 and 10 to see which fit I prefer. I've heard with the new toe box~ sizing down might be a good idea.  I can let you know in a couple days which size I think fits most similar to my old model.  ,Jul 2009,May 4 2020,0
7268,Another Hiangle sizing thread....yay!,1,4, older versions (V1 smurf blue and V2 updated gray).  I was a 12 US in both. Never tried the neon yellow synthetics. I went with 12.5  US in the whites. I’m a 13 running shoe,Apr 2015,May 4 2020,0
7269,Another Hiangle sizing thread....yay!,1,5, I’m a 10.5 men’s and have a C width foot with a lowish volume heel.  I went a half size down in the leather blue V2 and they’re great now.  Break in was kinda bad for the first three sessions.,Jan 2019,May 4 2020,0

7272,Another Hiangle sizing thread....yay!,1,8, Thanks guys.  I've got wide/low volume feet with zero arch.  I've seen some comments about the white synthetics having a higher volume than the older versions.  I might go with the current blue V2 in a half size down from my size 11 yellow/gray synthetics.  I can handle a little upfront discomfort~ as long as they'll stretch into a snug but bearable fit.,Apr 2004,May 5 2020,0
7273,Another Hiangle sizing thread....yay!,1,9, Follow up.  I got my blue/gray Hiangles today after using my coupon codes with their 5/10/20 sale ($53~ free shipping :) )   I ended going with my street shoe size 11.  They are seriously tight but will likely be perfect after some breaking in.  Honestly~ those of you who have sized down are either:  into pain~ not sizing your street shoe correctly~ or just plain cray.  Thanks for all the input~ everyone.,Apr 2004,May 15 2020,1

7277,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,0, I was tidying up my gear when I looked at my black diamond 120mm*10mm dynex sling and it was all twisted. Despite my best efforts I can't get it to lay flat - one side of the webbing seems much tighter than the other (or one side is much looser). If I load it up a bit it pulls tight and lays flat~ but otherwise the tight side springs together like a bungee. I can milk the bunched up part either way along the sling until I hit the bar tacks. I've only used this sling occasionally to extend my atc on rappel (doubled up with a limiter knot in the middle)~ and also tied a parisienne baudrier style chest harness to keep my gear sprung up while rope soloing. Other than that it sits twisted up on my gear rack. As it's the only dynex sling I have in this style I am 100% confident it has not come into any situation where it would have been rubbed against anything causing abrasion or wear. Can anyone tell me what is going on with it~ and am I gunna die?,Aug 2019,May 14 2020,1
7278,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,1," How old is that sling? I think the sling's shape simply have been from twisted storage. The high density polymers are stiffer in feel and function than the nylon counterparts.  I'm no scientist~ but I'd whip on that if there was a backup bolt~ or no ""grounding potential""",Apr 2016,May 14 2020,0
7279,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,2, Less than a year. I don't think this is from storage~ I have other similar slings from other brands that were stored like this and not affected.,Aug 2019,May 14 2020,0
7280,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,3, Not exactly the relationship I want to have with my rack  :),Apr 2011,May 14 2020,14
7281,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,4, Erik~ I don't have a good answer for what's wrong with it but you are DEFINITELY going to die. I do think that is an unusual shape for a dyneema sling to retain. But perhaps you use a more aggressive twist than I do when racking? And I am a huge fan of your socks.,Apr 2011,May 14 2020,6
7282,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,5," Depending on how the fibers are woven to create the sling~ if certain fibers are ""snagged"" or shortened you can get this type of behavior.  Slings are cheap.  I would buy a replacement and send this one back to BD and ask them what they think happened.",Apr 2003,May 14 2020,2
7283,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,6, Would totally dump it from a rack~ as you're saying other similar pieces of gear were stored similarly~ and this piece behaved oddly. $10 is an easy loss for piece of mind when you're shitting yourself on a hard lead.   Still great for the Hangboard and pulley set up :),Apr 2016,May 14 2020,1
7284,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,7, Scraped against something~ got heated on one side~ and shrank a bit? That's my best guess.,Jun 2019,May 14 2020,2
7285,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,8, Dump it from the rack.  Is it possible that the way you had it knotted when using it as an extension pulled the fibers weird? ,Apr 2018,May 14 2020,0

7287,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,10, Was it wet or damp when you put it away?,Jun 2011,May 15 2020,1
7288,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,11, Occasionally climbing equipment becomes possessed. We’ve probably all experienced the horror of a rope being possessed by the devil on rappel. This I think is a case of a lesser evil spirit possession. Perhaps an imp. My suggestion is to cleanse the room with some burning sage and purifying music. Good luck. ,May 2015,May 15 2020,10
7289,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,12, The old kink sling. The kink comes from utilizing a sling for non-climbing purposes~ or~ for a special subset of climbers~ it can happen through off width climbing.  You got something on this sling. My money is that it was exposed to precious bodily fluids~ the viscous kind. Admit it~ this isn't a kink sling case. This is a case of sling kink!,May 2015,May 15 2020,1
7290,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,13, I have a sling which did that after I used it to build a friction knot for a rappel - I know dyneema isn’t the right material for it~ but the alternative was no backup so I made do. I’m pretty sure the heat did it. Did you possibly heat it up with rope friction during a rappel?,Oct 2017,May 15 2020,1
7291,What's wrong with my BD dynex sling?,1,14, There appear to be a lot of loose dyneema fibers running along one of the edges~ the tighter~ shorter one~ something may have rubbed and uniformly snagged here?,Jun 2016,May 16 2020,0
7292,Crag bag - Mountain hardwear crag wagon 45,5,0, I'm looking at getting a crag bag that can stand up to abuse and also be comfortable for approaches. I want to be able to hold 40 pounds of gear (double rack~ rope~ shoes and harness etc) for trad solo routes with a couple miles approach. I want it to be durable enough to haul up after me when I'm done following my pitches on top rope. The mountain hardwear crag wagon caught my eye. Anyone have experience with it? Can anyone suggest a good crag bag that can fit my needs? ,Oct 2018,May 16 2020,0
7293,Crag bag - Mountain hardwear crag wagon 45,5,1, At 41 liters~ this is as durable (and comfortable) as you can get:https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/freerider-pack.html,Nov 2009,May 16 2020,1
7294,Crag bag - Mountain hardwear crag wagon 45,5,2, I really like the mammut neon 45,Sep 2012,May 16 2020,1
7295,Crag bag - Mountain hardwear crag wagon 45,5,3, I have used the crag wagon 45 about a dozen times for steep approaches with some scrambling anywhere from 10minutes to 25 minutes. It's the first climbing specific bag i've owned and I love some of the features.   Pros: The big zipper that has the bag fold open like a suitcase is great. It also has handles on the inside so you can carry it like a duffle bag without zipping it all up if you're just moving a few yards.  The loops at the top of the interior work great for organizing gear and keeping all your cams from jumbling at the bottom. and the closures at the top are super easy to operate and use to hold your rope. It holds a lot. I can easily pack a triple rack of camalots 0.3 to #3~ harness~ two pairs of shoes~ helmet~ grigri a dozen alpine draws~ a set of nuts~ a liter and a half of water~ guidebook~ and a lunch in this thing without it feeling like chaos. I also like the guidebook pocket (keeps the book from getting trashed by your gear.  The cons: no waterbottle pockets.  I am not sure why they did this~ but It would be nice to have a mesh or any type of pocket on the outside to hold water bottles. Also the cord you pull to close the top of the main compartment (chalkbag style) is so long that you have to be mindful to stash it or it will get caught in branches (not a big deal). There is a flap inside the bag that separates the interior into two compartments~ but it is such a big loose flap that it doesn't cinch anything down. I haven't found it very useful~ but it doesn't get in the way either. Bottomline: I can't recommend it over other bags since it's my first~ but I'd definitely recommend the bag especially since they have 30% off on the manufacturer's website.,Aug 2012,May 16 2020,3
7296,Ball nuts,1,0, I climbed a thin 10a crack the other day and there was a super thin section where I couldn't get any gear in. If I had either a piton or a ballnut~ I could have protected much better against a potential groundfall. Now I'm truly considering ballnuts as a specialized piece for specific routes. For all of you out there that use ball nuts I would like to know... - Are they worth it? - Which brand do you like better and why~ trango or camp? - Have you fallen on them before/what happened when you fell on them/did they explode/did they become fixed? - I read somewhere there was some dispute on the actual strength rating of the smaller sizes. Are they actually rated that strong? Thanks to all who reply!,Dec 2016,May 15 2020,1
7297,Ball nuts,1,1, I've never owned them~ but I've cleaned them.  It might just be the person I was climbing with and how they set them~ but I found them really hard to clean once set... they required pounding them out with a nut tool. So~ I dunno~ coul dbe technique on either the leader or the second's part... but that's a thing to think about.,Nov 2018,May 15 2020,0
7298,Ball nuts,1,2, Ball nuts are the tits. I don’t carry them regularly unless it’s a hard route with known shit gear. I use camps~ because someone gave them to me. Yes i’ve fallen on one~ no i didn’t die. They can definitely be hard to clean~ but i’ve never lost one. The 2 biggest sizes are less usefull in my opinion~ and are generally covered by .1/.2 cams  As far as the strength goes... I don’t care. Holding power has nothing to do with strength. And there’s no way you’re going to generate enough force to break one unless you weigh 400lbs and factor 2 it.,Jul 2014,May 15 2020,12
7299,Ball nuts,1,3, They are great~ especially in sandstone. I've whipped on them a few times and once cleaned a yellow ballnut that held a 60 foot whip. Sometimes tough to clean after falls but I've always gotten them out. Never pulled one in a fall. Both brands come out of the same factory and are identical.,Feb 2012,May 15 2020,8
7300,Ball nuts,1,4, Burst at the Seam? I'll be bringing them when I try that route. I don't recall whether or not I placed any on Narrow Gauge but I probably brought them. I'd personally recommend tricams for general Bolton climbing before ballnuts~ from my limited experience here. I do generally use them and like them though. Trango and Camp ballnuts are made in the same factory I think and one of them takes a slightly more conservative approach to the ratings than the other if I recall correctly. Someone more familiar will probably chime in on that. Overall I'd say they can be handy on a few routes around here in my experience~ they can be crucial on far fewer~ but in general I wouldn't call them an obligatory part of the rack. Edit: mixed up some names,Dec 2014,May 15 2020,0
7301,Ball nuts,1,5, I've taken a sizeable fall onto a red one (2nd smallest) in sandstone in zion after ripping a few nuts. Probably fell about 25 feet and it held. My partner didn't have much trouble cleaning it. I use ballnuts more for aid then free climbing. Ive had a friend or two whip onto the same red ballnut in granite while free climbing and it held and was retrieved. Cleaning them takes a little getting used to. You have to push the base in with a nut tool while retracting the ball. I use them Camp ones. Looks like the smallest size/blue is rated 1kn stronger in the Camp brand versus the Trango. The other 4 sizes are rated the same.,Jan 2015,May 15 2020,2
7302,Ball nuts,1,6, I carry a set of CAMPs.  They fill in gaps in the small cam range and can slot into deep seams.  Only issue I've had with them is they can't be placed in shallow cracks~ but that's why they're supplemental to micro cams.  Never had one blow...,Apr 2011,May 15 2020,1
7303,Ball nuts,1,7, Yes! Burst at the seam! and that's the thing~ that is the only route i can think of that I would want/need a piece like a ballnut~ so far at least...,Dec 2016,May 15 2020,0
7304,Ball nuts,1,8, did you look for any small nut placements? maybe if you ran up on TR you’d find at least a few places that could take a whip. i had ball nuts for awhile. racked them but didn’t really use them and passed them on. on parallel cracks in sandstone they might be awesome but i found them a little hard to place and we have constrictions in the east anyway. i’ll probably try them again someday though. ,Aug 2013,May 15 2020,0
7305,Ball nuts,1,9, I would say a good piton is better than a good ball nut~ it just depends on what kind of rock too~ cus in sandstone the ball nuts will rip out more easily from a fall and are better for just aiding on~ but in granite they are the tits,Jul 2018,May 15 2020,1
7306,Ball nuts,1,10, also check out the dmm dragon fly cam~ they are the smallest cam I've seen. I got to compare it yesterday to the new black diamond micro cam~ and the dmm is waaaay smaller,Jul 2018,May 15 2020,0
7307,Ball nuts,1,11, I have fallen on my ball nuts many times and only had it pop once.  I think both Camp and Trango ball nuts are exactly the same~ they may even roll off the same assembly line.  I usually carry three on multi-pitch (blue~ red~ gold).  I recommend them.  ,Dec 2014,May 15 2020,1
7308,Ball nuts,1,12, Ball nuts are specialized~ much like tri-cams~ imo. You need one when nothing else will work as well~ otherwise they're just in the way. If you go to do the John Fischer Memorial Route in Pine Creek Canyon take a few~ they work well in the thin crack pitch. ,Apr 2004,May 15 2020,1
7309,Ball nuts,1,13, I’m a fan. I only have the two smallest ones.  I almost always carry the red one on multi pitch and will bring the small blue one on occasion. ,Jan 2012,May 15 2020,1
7310,Ball nuts,1,14, thanks everyone! You all made some good points and I went for it on the three smaller sizes. Much appreciated!,Dec 2016,May 16 2020,3
7311,"2"" cut on bottom of $200~ newish Deuter backpack. Options?",1,0," I can't believe it. I must have put it down on on a sharp rock or something. It's a perfect cut~ 2"" long~ completely clean. No idea what did it. But it's there. I'm trying to figure out options to fix this. I don't think I can return it to REI~ although it is within the 1 year return window (bought late last year with a gift card). I'm thinking about sewing it up and then reinforcing the inside with some felt and Gorilla Glue~ or some other kind of ribber cement. Would that work though? I tend to stuff my tent into the bottom section and ""seal it off"" from the top compartment~ which is separate. Is this a longterm solution? Super annoyed. I was kind of questioning how tough the material was- it's sort of thin. I have a sort of generic Teton backpack that's a bit smaller and about the same weight~ but made of much more heavy duty material that i can use for the season... but still.

7313,"2"" cut on bottom of $200~ newish Deuter backpack. Options?",1,2, Try to get it replaced or repaired by the manufacturer and rei first. If that doesn't work~ decent sewing skills should be sufficient. Something like that I would repair by first carefully sewing the cut shut so that the edges touch~ but not pulling hard enough to stress the material and make it unravel further. Then I would lay down a thick and durable fabric on the inside and sew that in place stitching all the way around close to the cut~ then again a little further away from the cut. You can use a fabric glue or any other glue/bonding substance that will remain flexible if you want a little extra strength and security~ but make sure not to use anything that dries brittle and hard like super glue.

7315,"2"" cut on bottom of $200~ newish Deuter backpack. Options?",1,4, I used to sew my backpacks~ but depending on the material it will eventually pull. I started just putting a patch of Gorilla Tape on the inside. It works better than glue (I think) because it spreads the strength over a larger area. Tenacious Tape works as well~ but is a lot more expensive. If you want to go all out sew it~ put some glue on it~ then tape it. I tend to go for ultralight backpacks~ and just patch them until the become too heavy. Gorilla tape pro-tip: heat it up with a blow dryer~ heat gun~ or sun after application~ and it will more or less permanently attach to whatever it's on.,Aug 2012,May 15 2020,4

I've patched plenty of backpacks with Seam Grip.  Works great.  For really tiny holes I just coat it in Seam Grip.  For larger holes put a nylon patch over it and then Seam Grip.  For a longer tear it would be preferable to sew it and then Seam Grip it. It also works great to repair small holes in soft shell ski pants when you stab yourself with your crampons.,Dec 2007,May 15 2020,2

Glueing is a lot less work than sewing and I find it more durable. For the bottom of a pack (which could see significant loads)~ I'd put one piece of webbing on the inside and one on the outside.

7349,Difference in Fit of Miura Lace vs. Velcro,1,0, Hey everyone! I tried on a pair of the Miura VS’s and they frankly put too much pressure on my big toes for me to reasonably wear them without every climb being an absolute sufferfest. Otaki’s are way better for my feet especially when it comes to pressure on the knuckles of my big toes. My question is how much different is the fit of the lace Miuras~ given that they are less aggressive. I don’t have a climbing shop near me where I can just go try on shoes so advice may help a little.,Feb 2020,May 13 2020,0
7350,Difference in Fit of Miura Lace vs. Velcro,1,1, In my opinion~ the miura lace is much more narrow than the velcro.  They will have less room up front. The katana lace may bridge the gap regarding forefoot volume between miura lace and otaki.  It is my go-to shoe- stiff and precise but not too uncomfortable standing on your feet.  Hope that helps...,Nov 2009,May 13 2020,2
7351,Difference in Fit of Miura Lace vs. Velcro,1,2, The lace version will stretch to your foot much more than the velcro. Really different shoes.,Nov 2017,May 14 2020,2
7352,Difference in Fit of Miura Lace vs. Velcro,1,3, They are pretty significantly different shoes~ down to the structure of the midsole. Personally~ I think they show their strengths on entirely different types of routes. I love my lace miuras for trad climbing and sport climbing or bouldering that isn't overhanging. Anything significantly overhanging~ especially bouldering~ the VS are way better. ,Oct 2018,May 14 2020,1
7353,Difference in Fit of Miura Lace vs. Velcro,1,4, I wear a US 9/ EU 42 street shoe size in most brands. Scarpa/Salewa/Adidas/Nike/La Sportiva. The Miura VS will feel slightly more accommodating in the toe box (feels wider). - They are better for any climbing involving overhanging climbing. -  I wear the Miura VS in a 40 for a comfortable route climbing fit~ and a 39.5 for an aggressive route climbing fit. I can size down to 39 for bouldering purposes. - The toe box is asymmetrically shaped~ for directing power to the big toe. The Miura Lace has a very narrow fit~ but the leather will stretch to accommodate different width feet (I measure a C/D width on a Brannock device). - The Miura Lace has a very narrow~ and rather shallow heel cup. -  I wear a 39.5 for most situations. The laces easily adjust midfoot tension. - A little more of a symmetrical toe box than the Miura VS~ the Miura lace is more accommodating if a second toe is longer than a big toe. If the Otakis fit you well~ you may consider the Katana Lace - both are constructed on a tubular construction. Notice the 'tongue construction' similarities. The Otaki and Katana Laces definitely fit wider than the whole Miura series. Have owned multiple pairs of every shoe listed here; I work for a rock climbing shoe company. Edit: What is your normal street shoe size~ and what is the EU size of your Otakis?,Apr 2016,May 14 2020,2

7356,Do Grivel crampons lose their edge fast or is it me?,1,0, I bought a pair of semmi-auto 12-point Grivels last year and used them until they were worn down to a nice soft nickel-ish edge. About two weeks ago I sharpened them up and did a little light hill-walking in them this weekend. I walked on a few dozen meters worth of granite in them. I got back to the car~ looked at the things~ and the edge I put on is completely gone.

7373,Do Grivel crampons lose their edge fast or is it me?,1,17, Higher carbon steels will be harder and stronger but also more brittle. Hardness refers to a materials ability to resist deformation~ ie hold a sharp edge in this application. Heat treatments allow for a lot of different crystal microstructures within the steel. For example~ quenching steel in a water bath (dropping it from the austenite phase to below ~100 degrees Celcius very quickly) produces a crystal structure called martensite. I would imagine martensite is ideal for crampons (ignoring corrosion) because it is both ductile and strong~ so it will hold an edge and also be less likely to fracture/break. Cooling steel at different rates produces different microstructures~ for example~ with the right carbon content~ slow cooling will produce pearlite~ which is not as strong as martensite. The qualities of steel can also be changed with cold working and annealing. Cold working basically means deforming the metal~ which adds dislocations to the material~ increasing hardness and strength~ while reducing ductility. Annealing involves bringing the material to a particular temperature (generally 300 ~ 500 degrees Celcius for steel)~ and holding it there for a bit. Annealing increases the grain size of the material's crystals and removes dislocations~ thereby making the material more soft and ductile. I just pulled the following pictures from a quick google search~ and I do not own them.,Apr 2016,May 13 2020,4

7401,What is in your quiver of ropes?,1,2, Well then~ I have way too many ropes... -*80m Tendon Master Pro 9.2-Main sport rope for cliffs that merit (or might) a long rope. Multi-pitch if I know I'm whipping. -80M Edelrid 8.9-Onsighting harder multi-pitch routes & redpoints on long pitches. -*80M Beal Opera 8.5-Multi-pitch where falling is not anticipated. -*70M Bluewater Icon 9.1-Used to be 80. Has become my go-to for general use. Will probably become a 60 or 65 soon. -60M Roca 9.4-Used to be 80. Super stretchy (low impact force). Use it if I think I'm whipping on little gear~ so rarely. -60M Maxim 10.2-  Won't die. Toproping. -50M Mammut 9.8-Short stuff -45M Sterling 9.8-Short stuff -40M Sterling 9.4-Shorter stuff. Now I feel embarrassed (but also a bit patriotic as I admire my excess). The three 80's is especially absurd~ but I tell myself I'll have them forever as I keep cutting them down. The 40-50M ropes are super useful for a lot of the local climbing out here. *Denotes the ropes I'd bring on a longer trip if I don't have a specific objective in mind and will be at different areas climbing different stuff.,Mar 2010,May 7 2020,5
7402,What is in your quiver of ropes?,1,3," 70m 9.7mm rope for 30-35m pitches 60m 9.5mm rope for shorter pitches 60m 10.2mm rope for setting TR for people that might destroy my good ropes (I go this for free from a friend) 50m rope for really short pitches (rarely used). This might become a gym rope when I retire my current one One half of a former 70m rope for the gym (longer half) Set of 60m 8mm half/twin rated ropes for wandering multi pitch~ or for long rappels like in Red Rock. I am too lazy to make long approaches for alpine~ but i would use them for that. Many retired ropes: used for rugs~ or given to tree trimmers~ or dog leashesWhich ropes you choose depends a lot on what you are going to climb. I regret buying a 9.2mm single rope that got snagged on a feature and core shot on its first day out. It happened on a route with a short enough approach that the weight savings was not worth having to shorten the rope. So now I like a rope that is at least 9.7mm with a robust feeling sheath. I don't climb hard enough to justify any weight savings from a thinner rope. Maybe fewer beers would make more of a difference for me.Unless you are going to do climbing photography~ I would go with an ugly rope (sheath made from leftover fibers from expensive ropes)~ so they cost less than a ""pretty"" rope~ or a bi-pattern rope. If you do plan to take many climbing pictures~ get a bright colored rope so it stands out from the rock. I once nearly gave my mother a heart attack when I showed her a picture of me climbing on a dull colored rope--she thought I was free soloing.Bi-pattern ropes cost more than one with a middle mark. Will you be rappelling or lowering more?A rope is a consumable resource~ so I tend to buy cheap. Edit: if you go for half ropes~ get two different colors! Then when you rappel~ keep telling yourself~ ""pull the blue rope"". ",Nov 2011,May 7 2020,0

7462,Are these bolts legit?,1,7, Hey Delaney~ I apologize if you've already spoken with the OAC. I know they are replacing a ton of old bolts with glue-ins now. (and may have made it mandatory)  However~ if you have not~ if your bolting most crags on the escarpment I'd post on the Ontario 2020 facebook group. Tons of experienced bolters on that page.

7464,Are these bolts legit?,1,9," 3/8 is standard here~ not 12mm. Basically all of the Niagara escarpment is bolted this way (AFAIK). Gets a lot of traffic~ nobody has died yet.

7467,Most used tricam sizes,1,0, Please note~ I'm only interested in responses from people who own and use tricams. Please don't come to tell me they aren't useful. I own and frequently place tricams black through brown (I think that's .25~ .5~ 1~ and 1.5). They work great for the kind of rock near me. My experience is that I place pink the most~ then red~ then probably a tie for brown and black.

7471,Most used tricam sizes,1,4, Pink and red = 95% of my usage (mostly on easier climbs at the Gunks).  I usually carry two of each -- plus the black and brown but tend not to use them.  Have stopped carrying others.  So: .25~ .5~ .5~ 1.0~ 1.0~ and 1.5 -- which is the limit for me for one big oval-wire biner. ,Aug 2009,May 8 2020,5

7475,Most used tricam sizes,1,8, I love all the tri cam sizes. I especially find 5~ 6~ 7 good for set top ropes or when my number 4 cam isn’t big enough for a lead. Also you can stack those baby’s on top of each other. But when leading I always carry red~ pink~ blue unless I know I need something bigger then it’s usually white and green. For my local Craig tri-cams are where it’s at! Get em all! Plus that 7 is like a weapon.,Aug 2015,May 8 2020,1
7476,Most used tricam sizes,1,9, Pink and black - I have doubles of those. I also have a single brown and red~ those only seem to get placed in anchors for some reason.,Oct 2017,May 8 2020,1
7477,Most used tricam sizes,1,10, I have used tricams since they first came out.  I use the pink~ red~ and brown instead of the larger nuts~ as well as backups when I place both cams of a given size.  I also carry the small black one~ but only use it when absolutely necessary (because the specs are not confidence inspiring). While I like them for the above reasons~ I tend to place other gear first~ since both placing and cleaning tricams can take longer than the alternatives. I think these sizes set really well in camming mode.  As you get into larger ones~ they seem much more likely to rattle out after you pass them.,Jul 2010,May 8 2020,3
7478,Most used tricam sizes,1,11, .5 1 3 5 .25 In that order. The 5 is much lighter than a cam (or a number 4 Tricam) and fits in odd flares well.,Mar 2020,May 8 2020,1
7479,Most used tricam sizes,1,12, Yeah~ pink and black are my go-to sizes.  CAMP put black~ pink~ red brown in the standard set and it's perfect~ though I tend to not use brown much.  I find weird pockets in things around here that like either pink or black and won't hold a cam at all.  Red and brown are good for anchors as others have said~ I use those if I used my cams on the pitch. I also picked up a #7 since I found it used at a local place - it's fun~ but falls out if you breathe on it or look at it funny.,Sep 2018,May 8 2020,2
7480,Most used tricam sizes,1,13, Like others~ I mostly use the pink and red (and love it when I do!). I own a few of the larger ones (green~ yellow~ orange)~ but essentially never use them. At those sizes it is rare there is a crack that the tricam would fit in well but a cam wouldn't. In addition I can't figure out a way to place the larger them one handed and their weight ratio vs. the same sized cam is less favorable than in the smallest sizes.,Aug 2014,May 8 2020,1
7481,Most used tricam sizes,1,14, I most often place the pink~ then red~ occasionally black and rarely brown. When i first discovered how great tricams are i bought a complete set.  The middle sizes were tolerable but cams are much better.  The large sizes are unstable and not useful. ,Feb 2006,May 8 2020,5

7501,Most used tricam sizes,2,13," Pink and black always seem to get used.  Next red.  Rarely brown.  I use the orange (5) and yellow (6) for anchors on quartzite frequently enough to keep them around.  But 2~ 2.5~ 3~ 3.5~ 4: have gone out of my way to try to place them . . . and they still never seem to work.  The green one I have a special antipathy for . . . son of a bitch seems like it SHOULD fit so many places and never does.  #7 is too big for anything but I like it as museum piece . . . pull it out at cocktail parties.  The only one I don't own is the white.  I don't aid climb so it never seemed worth it.  I should probably get one just so I can say I have a full set. For around $100 it would seem this thread would indicate the CAMP Evo  quad-pack of black to brown is probably not a bad investment.  Sink the pink or black one when you need it and get the tricasm and it is well worth the Benjamin! Two more interesting questions for me in terms of sizing: Has anyone ""stacked"" the larger sizes (5~6~7) effectively?  Who has had the cajones to place tricams when ICE climbing?  That just seems absolutely nuts to me~ but apparently they work like gangbusters on ice in the right conditions.

7509,Mythos Eco review?,1,0, My shoe arsenal is getting a bit spare. Among other things~ I need to replace my Mythos because both pairs are held together with chewing gum and bailing wire. Any review on the quality of the new “Eco” version of the Mythos? I’m a little wary of “water based adhesives.” Any experience with delaminationor durability problems? And “recycled rubber sole” gives me pause. Mythos are not exactly a high-performance shoe to begin with~ a poorer-performing rubber might make them garbage. Anyone have an opinion on the comparable rubber quality to the standard Mythos?,Mar 2006,Mar 1 2018,0
7510,Mythos Eco review?,1,1," I'll second this. I've been meaning to start a thread of the same questions~ so thank you Dylan for doing so. My impression without actually using them is that it is ""green washing"". If they are saving so much on materials through recycling~ why do they charge more for them than the old Mythos? And yeah~ it's durability and rubber stickiness performance is suspect. The old version has had problems of the rands peeling for years~ is this fixed in the new version~ and will glue hold up? ",unknown,Mar 1 2018,2

7517,Mythos Eco review?,1,8, um~ this post was from a while ago but no one answered the OP's question so . . . the mythos ecos are great. they were my only climbing shoe for about 6 months and I loved them. I got them a little tighter than I expected (tried on plenty of sizes at REI) and they stretched just like the normal mythos do the rubber is fine. looked and felt like any other shoe so don't let that give you pause. after 6 months of mostly indoor bouldering~ some sport climbing~ and some indoor TR they needed a resole  these shoes can't heel hook to save your life but they're super comfortable. I'd wear them 3 hours straight at the gym,Nov 2018,Mar 23 2020,5
7518,Mythos Eco review?,1,9, Thanks. I ended up buying a regular pair~ but when they wear out I’ll buy the Eco version next.  Based on your climbing record in this post~ I’d recommend you try a shoe that’s a little more performance based. Mythos are super comfy~ and I use them for all-day trad. But bouldering~ sport and TR in the gym warrant something at least a little more aggressive. ,Mar 2006,May 12 2020,0
7519,Mythos Eco review?,1,10, imo mythos eco are almost better than regular. there’s basically no difference in rubber in my experience~ and i have a pair that’s been going for three years with only one resole. also~ not sure if it’s just my experience but the rubber on the rand seems more durable in terms of delamination~ as my pair looks great there while i’ve seen a lot of regular mythos have problems there.,Jul 2017,May 12 2020,1
7520,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,0, Does anyone have advice to share on buying slide-in truck campers for full-size half-ton pick-up trucks?  Recommendations on manufacturers~ models~ options~ and after-market modifications would be appreciated.   I haven't bought a truck yet~ but I am currently favoring the Ford F-150 over mid-size trucks (Tacoma) and other half-ton models.  However~ I don't want to pull the trigger~ until I have chosen a camper.   I have already done a bit of research on different companies and models~ but it seems like there are very few recent reviews (past year) to be found on the internet.  As far as I can tell~ it appears that Four Wheel Campers~ All-Terrain Campers~ Hallmark~ and Pheonix are currently the top brands for light-weight off-road capable campers.  Just from reading their websites~ I don't notice much differentiation.,Aug 2013,Jan 12 2017,1
7521,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,1, Subscribed. Cant wait to see some off the info in this thread...   Ive been looking into this as well~ theyre $$$$ for what you get. You can get a towable for the same price. Ive started leaning towards the flippac/habitat tent type campers or just a basic shell. You still have full use of the bed and shell for everyday use~ theyre light which is good for mpg but also from what I read hold up better if you actually drive offroad. Theyre more aero than the pop-ups and full size campers. However~ you don't get the sink/pisser/oven/heater or some of the other luxuries that require maintenance. adventuretrailers.com/campe…,Feb 2015,Jan 13 2017,0
7522,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,2, For what it's worth~ my setup is pictured below.  I dont have the money for a slide in so I just got a good shell and an air mattress.  I splurged on the air mattress~ you will notice it conforms to the wheel wells and turns the sleeping area from a twin to a full sized bed.   Pros:   ~Its big enough for myself and 2 other dudes to sleep in it sheltered from the weather~ note we are in separate sleeping bags.   ~it still allows me to use the truck as a truck   Cons:   ~Need to clear out truck at campground to set up bed.   ~Single cab truck means i'm always rearranging gear and food (our local areas we only need to worry about birds and rodents eating our food).   Do Overs:   ~I would get a taller shell to allow for more head room~ We can not sit up while on top of the air mattress.   ~I think I would like to build storage drawers our of plywood in place of the air mattress and then use a 2-3 inflated sleeping pad vs the air mattress.   I hope this helps~ if not let me know and I can take down the post so it doesn't deter the thread.  Truck,Mar 2015,Jan 13 2017,0
7523,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,3, I've owned three.  And have done a ton of research.     First~ decide on how much time you want to setup~ fuck around~ repair~ repair~ repair on your vacation.  The more moving parts you have the greater chance you will be fixing something.  I've done that.  I'm over that.     Second~ decide pop up or hard side.  I did the pop up.  It got old~ especially when it didn't pop up during a trip.  And~ a pop up is a glorified tent.  The sides flap in the wind.  And it is a poor insulator against cold~ the heat and wind.     I decided for my next purchase I want a maximum of 30 seconds set up time.  That's what I got.  I attach the stairs.  Done!  Time for beer~ camp fire~ dinner~ whatever.  Actually~ we don't do fires much anymore.  And when the weather turns to shit~ my tent friends come in and hang out.  I went hard side.     The brands you mention are similar.  Average quality parts.  Turn to junk after 10 to 15 years.  Four Wheel is ok.  Fairly light~ yes.  But~ really a lot of money for the minimalist approach.       I met the engineer for Camp Craft a few years ago.  He worked for some of the other companies and decided to do his own things.  All hard side~ all have R21 insulation~ egyptian roof structure~ and surprisingly light weight.  Mine is 1700 lbs.  I can make it 80 degrees in it in winter easily.  Also~ I don't hear other people around me because of the sound insulation.  We can seat five for dinner and have 8 in there playing cards very cozy.  Much bigger that it appears from the outside.  Sleeps 3 comfy~ 4 cozy.   Check them out.    Comfy at the tower.,Apr 2006,Jan 13 2017,3

7528,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,8, If you're going with any kind of a slide-in~ I'd recommend a 3/4 ton truck or bigger.  You can add air bags~ and suspension upgrades and all that~ but you're not actually increasing the payload of the truck.  Stopping and other things get harder~ especially in a 1/2 ton.  Think about how much weight you'll be adding to the camper/truck combo just to go camping.  Water~ food~ aux batteries~ climbing equipment~ ... etc.  Better to play it safe.  I know people use 1/2 tons all the time~ and YMMV.  Look at the forums on expeditionportal.com or wanderthewest.com for tons of other opinions.   Good luck~ dude!   Steve,Feb 2010,Jan 13 2017,1
7529,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,9, F150 or equivalent is the way to go.  I had a Tacoma and they are a little on the small side for a camper. I ended up getting a Tundra which is far nicer with the camper. I'm a fan of our Pop up due to the lower profile and never found set up time to be a big deal (less than 5 minutes).  I've taken the pop up lots of places you could never take a hard side due to the height.  We have the insulated material instead of thin canvas sides on the pop up part which I would recommend.  I would also suggest you look into Torklift tie downs~ some type of quick release turnbuckle~ and firestone airbags.  Worth the cash and all have held up to really well to mild offroad stuff that I've done.  If you get a four wheel camper I think they bolt it directly to the bed which is probably even better.   You will probably also want to add a battery isolator in your truck to charge the camper battery.,Mar 2008,Jan 13 2017,0

7531,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,11, If you end up getting air bags~ take a look at the load lifter 5000 ultimate bags. They have a jounce bumper built in so you can run them under 20psi (if you are unloaded or forgot to air them up for a while) without damaging the bags. airliftcompany.com/products…,Apr 2003,Jan 13 2017,0

7533,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,13, I've had both a rigid and a popup on my small trucks for over twenty years.  I originally had an Ultralite wood framed rigid~ and currently have a Phoenix popup.  Started out with the Ultralite (700#) on a short bed Nissan 4cyl.  It slowly died after my girlfriend hit a tree limb with it~ and I didn't fix the damage until too late (just started to rot the wood frame).  I'm currently drive a 6 cyl Tacoma extra cab with the Phoenix.  The Phoenix is heavy--probably 1300#.  I have 250# extra rear springs~ and Firestone air bags.  I've actually weighed my rig with a years worth of stuff (rock/ice/ski gear~ two bikes~photography gear~ food etc.) and I was 1000# OVER GVWR.  It is extremely easy to surpass GVWR with any slide in camper. I was crushing the brackets for my airbags~ and had to have them reinforced and welded to the frame.    I found gas mileage with the lighter rigid camper was the same as the heavier popup.  Obviously I could go more places with the popup.  I've used it to 10 below F~ with no problems (don't heat at night--just 5-10 minutes to warm it up).  That's without adding insulation~ but without onboard water (which will freeze unless you really have things dialed--a couple of friends used there popup for ice climbing in Alberta~ and worked things out). It takes about 2 minutes to pop it up--flip toggles on corners~ lift up and push out internal supports and you're set--not much to it.   Four Wheel Campers are probably the lightest out there~ and weight is critical--better mileage~ less wear and tear~ less need to get a beefier truck.  My Phoenix is a 2004 or so (bought used)~ and I wouldn't buy a new one unless they've radically changed their methods and materials--expensive~ heavy~ and mediocre quality.  They do have an aluminum frame though~ so it should last longer than my wood Ultralite (which I bought used for $1000 in 1994~ and used until about 2009).   An advantage to a rigid camper over a popup is the ability to put stuff on top (canoes~ rocket boxes~ etc.). My popup is spring assisted~ but I had to add additional struts (a la Four Wheel Camper) to allow me to carry two canoes on top.  Of course that will depend on the system on the camper--electric assist might work without modification--something to check on when you do your research.   Think about what all stuff you want inside the camper.  I have a water heater and an external shower on mine~ and I've never used either (and will remove them once the weather warms up).  Don't have a toilet~ and use a folding camp toilet.  The less you have~ the less you have to worry about~ and the less weight you're carrying (weight really shows its ugly head when you're on rough roads).   Other things to consider:  heavier tires for the added weight e.g. load range E~ perhaps a higher-output alternator to charge the camper battery (I have stock)~ suspension air bags~ perhaps other suspension mods~ such as adjustable shocks~ stiff shocks~ lifts~ etc.  Many people set up solar systems--not necessary if you live simply~ even without a battery charging/isolating system.  I can get about two weeks off grid off a single deep cell battery.  I have an isolator that I have yet to install~ which would probably let me go forever.   Good luck.,Mar 2016,Jan 28 2017,0
7534,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,14, Number one piece of advice is research~ research~ and when you get tired of research do more research. Peep around on Craigslist and other sites and be patient. I recently purchased a ram 2500 with a hard side Lance as a package deal at an extremely reasonable price. It is by far the best investment I've made to date.    The pop ups I've been around are finicky and typically allow more weak points in the system for failure (leaks~ tears~ ect.) That being said~ you get a lower clearance and a marginal difference in mpg.   If you are dead set on a smaller F150 or 1500~ look into camplite slide ins. They are constructed with aluminum frames and a composite material. Lightweight and will fight the elements better IMO.  You could also look at a truck with a topper and a pull behind scamp. All options for the light duty truck.    Like I said~ be patient and research thoroughly. If possible bring someone with camper experience to come look at whatever you plan on purchasing.  That helped me out big time.,Jan 2016,Jan 28 2017,0
7535,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,15, +1 to awesome thread.   I'm also planning to make a truck + camper purchase in the next year and have been doing a good amount of research.   I'm pretty set on a pop-up due to the lower profile and center of gravity for potential future off-roading/overland travel.  When I was still living in CO~ I went and toured the Hallmark factory - which you should do if you are in the Front Range.  The guys were awesome~ their construction is top notch~ and they're open to just about any kind of customization.  I've gathered from several other forums that Hallmark is the apex of pop up camper quality and construction and they stand by their product 100%.  They have heavily insulated walls~ dual pane windows and insulated tent materials~ I was assured that they are good (i.e. keeping on board water unfrozen) down to at least ten below F.  The unfortunate downside is that you have to pay for it.  A tricked out new pop-up from them can close in on $40K~ also they are quite a bit heavier than 4WC~ necessitating a 3/4- or one-ton truck.    Now~ I'm pretty well focused on the Northstar pop ups (specifically the 850sc) with the Sub-Zero addition which includes similar insulation to the Hallmarks~ but you can get a new camper for much less.   I imagine a time in the future where I may go hardside as Greg has~ especially if cold weather camping becomes the primary use.  In fact~ when I was living in CO~ this is what got me interested in the first place as I saw it as a possible work around to having to deal with ski traffic on the weekends.  However~ now that I live in Idaho~ and can ski lifts in the morning and be home by noon~ I'm more interested in a camper with some cold weather potential but mostly agile and mobile for shoulder-season and summer camping.   Regarding trucks~ you're going to be pretty limited to smaller pop-ups or minimal hard side campers if you don't go 3/4 or full ton.  Some of those smaller campers would be fine for a solo~ but throw a wife into the picture and space and storage becomes a little bit more valuable.,Jul 2011,Jan 29 2017,0

7537,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,17, I've had a Four Wheel camper for two years now. It's an early 90's Grandby 8' model and I have it in my 1997 Ram 2500HD diesel 4x4. Sure it looks a little dated inside and weathered on the outside but everything still works and there's no leaks. I've camped in all seasons in it and even lived in it daily for over two months straight when I moved to Colorado. It has no shower (I bathe outside with a Nemo pressure shower) and no toilet. It has fridge~ stove~ sink~ 10 gal water~ and furnace. They come up on the used market occasionally but less so than other RVs it seems like~ probably because they are easier to store. It is a pain to take on and off (especially getting the bolt holes to line up putting it on) so I leave it on most of the time. It doesn't affect my fuel mileage much; I still get 20mpg on the highway. Its light weight doesn't affect the handling much either and I've taken it on many gnarly roads. Just to ditto what others are saying~ unless you're going to modify suspension~ get a 3/4 or 1 ton truck.  lead king loop  escalante canyon,Feb 2012,Jan 30 2017,0
7538,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,18, Their website doesn't seem to work in either Firefox or Chrome browsers.   And agreed popups are glorified tents but not nearly as ridiculous as those rooftop tents that are becoming popular for whatever reason. I would prefer a hardtop for the sound and heat insulation but I don't think I could live with the height as a daily driver or for 4x4 roads. I wouldn't want to take it on and off every weekend. I've seen several local Four Wheel owners that leave theirs on nearly year-round like me. ,Feb 2012,Jan 30 2017,0
7539,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,19, Don't know their name but I met a guy who had a sweet slide in made in ocean grove~ CA. Was a frame that comes empty inside so you can do your own thing. $2500 ish range.,Mar 2016,Jan 30 2017,0
7540,Slide-In Truck Campers,1,20, Bumping this thread. Anyone have any experience with some of the new lighter hard-sided campers for 1/2 tons?  Or anything else to share? ,Aug 2007,May 12 2020,0
7541,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,0,  We purchased a new pop-up A-ll-Terrain Camper last fall for our 2010 Tundra - given that the payload of the Tundra is somewhat anemic~ wanted the camper to be as light as possible.  We got the basic Panther shell with a bench/bed on the passenger side for my son (we sleep up top)~ an extra 12-v plug~ and an additional roof vent.  Since they are a small shop~ they are more than happy to work with you on any custom modifications you might want.  After we purchased it~ I added solar panels~ and bought a Dometic 12-v cooler- I also made a small cabinet and installed straps to keep stuff under the bench.  That's basically it.  Still comes in at approx 800 lbs.  Popping the top is easy - my 12-year old son does it in about 3 minutes.  With several road trips under out belt~ we love it. The only modification I did to the truck itself was to install a sway bar.  Handles like a dream. We visited 4-wheel and All-Terrain in person - All-Terrain campers is a small shop~ and I really appreciated the individualized customer service.  I got a tour of their shop and got to inspect campers in various stages of construction - Their aluminum welds are works of art - it's a shame they have to cover them up.  The quality construction and materials used in the ATC was also superior to 4-wheel~ in my opinion.  That~ plus their willingness to make minor modifications to their basic shell is what sold us on them. 4-wheel camper just came out with a bolt-on pop-up topper that bolts to the bed rails.  Looks intriguing.  We briefly considered Bel-Air Camper shells (they have a cab-over model)~ but it was a bit too much like a normal shell for us.    If you want any more info~ feel free to PM me.,Apr 2019,May 12 2020,1
7542,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,1," I had a slide-in for two years. It was a 1~000-ish lb. Panther custom camper in a Ford Ranger (bought the camper used). It was really cool~ but~ ultimately~ a total pain. Where to store it in winter? In the garage~ but it takes up half the garage. I live in Montana~ so I was losing half my storage for half the year. What do you do when you need to use your truck to haul stuff? You take the camper on and off and on and off. Not impossible~ but a pain in the ass that needs to be planned for.  What happens when it springs a leak on a trip? You buy $100 worth of seam tape and hope for the best. In the end~ I sold the truck and the camper and bought a little 2010 Ford Transit Connect~ ""built it out~"" and a 1988 Toyota truck to be able to haul wood~ dump runs~ rally around it the snow~ etc. Never going back to the slide in~ they're cool~ but not worth the effort (for me). ",Oct 2016,May 12 2020,1
7543,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,2, I've got a Hallmark Guanella that rides in a 2015 Silverado 1500. When I'm loaded for a trip~ I max out my payload. The truck gets a little boaty~ but not dangerously so. At some point in the near future~ I will upgrade my rear suspension to better handle the load. In 5 years or so I will replace the 1/2 ton truck with a 3/4 ton. Regarding ease of use~ it takes me about 30 minutes to load or unload the camper from the truck. I've only owned it for 9 months so that time keeps creeping down as I get better at loading it. I store my slide-in in my driveway on large sawhorses that I built to support the bottom of the camper. I cover the camper in the winter with a large heavy duty tarp. Its really not a huge deal (for me) to load and unload the camper for weekend trips. I upgraded to the slide in from a basic build out with a fiberglass shell. My wife and I just had a kid and we wanted to still be able to get out with the baby and have a good time. I think for many climbers who don't have families~ a full-on slide-in doesn't make sense. For those who want to live in the truck full time or who have families~ the slide-in starts to make more sense. Personally~ I don't want a van because I want to be able to use my vehicle for more than just camping and trucks are cool.,Sep 2013,May 12 2020,2
7544,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,3, Great stuff~ thanks to those responses so far.  In a pop-up~ do the sides flap in the wind at all? How are they in the cold? ,Aug 2007,May 12 2020,0
7545,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,4, I haven't noticed any flapping in the wind yet~ but admittedly haven't been in any big storms yet.  A pop-up is colder than a hard-sided camper~ but definitely warmer than a tent.  Also~ you can get an insulated cover that you Velcro to the inside of the flexible (pop-up) part that will help a lot.  There are a number of forums online that have much more info.  My wife did the research for ours- I'll see if I can get you some links to those forums. ,Apr 2019,May 12 2020,1
7546,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,5, My canvas sides dont really flap. They are pulled taut when the roof is raised. Mine is also double walled~ so it seems to stay pretty warm. We’ve camped in it down to below freezing temps without a problem. Its way warmer than my old built out camper shell!,Sep 2013,May 12 2020,2
7547,Slide-In Truck Campers,2,6," I had a Bigfoot fiberglass shell hard sided camper years ago on a Ford F350. Lived in it for a month in Alaska in January. It was nice. Currently I have a 98 Lance 9.5 hard sided. It's wood frame and aluminum siding and it still works great and has no issues. It has a one piece aluminum roof so no leaks. I paid $4~200 for it about 5 years ago~ and it looked like new. It has all the amenities and I use them. I like having a hot shower. I like having a convenient bathroom in the night. I like using my own clean bathrooms instead of gross ones at rest stops or other public ones. I like having a 3 way fridge with my food / drinks ready at any time. I like a full kitchen and sink with hot water to make nice meals easily. I have a solar panel on it which is great. I can run the heater all night and the lights~ and in a couple hours in a sunny morning it will charge right back up. I have a F-250 4x4 crew cab~ diesel~ long bed. Basically the heaviest truck you can buy~ which isn't great because it takes away your weight carrying capacity. The camper weighs about 2~500 lbs. The only difference between the F350 and F250 for my year is the F350 has blocks on the rear suspension to raise it a little and a little helper spring. I added air bags~ sway bar~ and upgraded shocks. They helped~ but what it needed most of all was beefy helper springs like these.  The suspension handled the weight and top heaviness of the camper no problem after these. I should've done that first. It's over the legal limit of the truck~ but under the axle and tires weight rating. It handles and stops fine. But I still keep the mph down to 59 mph on the freeway typically because it has so much wind resistance it really kills the mpg above that. My truck gets about 17 empty. About 13.5 with the camper. Really the big campers are supposed to be on duallies~ but my friend has a dually and mine with the beefy helper springs sways less than his with a similar camper. If you can get away with 2WD it will handle better and get a little better mpg because it won't sit as high. I have acreage so I have plenty of space to store it. I also have a clean out for my septic system where I store it so I can dump at home. We have two cars and the truck. I drove trucks for years (Toyotas) and it's so much nicer and more economical to drive a car as a daily driver. So I have the truck only for when I need it. Which is for the camper or towing. So I don't need to take the camper off and on more than a few times year. It only takes me about 15 minutes. I'm debating getting a Northstar pop up though. It would be nice to be able to drive 65-70 and not worry so much about mpg. And it would handle better. It would be a step down in terms of comfort though. For two people you could live out of a camper for months. With 3 it's a little tight. With 4 it's a weekend before you start to go a little crazy. I'll bring a tent and set that up as the ""2nd bedroom"" when we have our family of four.",Oct 2011,May 12 2020,1
7548,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,0," Hi all~ My employer started a $500 ""wellness fund"" this year~ and I just got the go-ahead to spend my funds on any sort of rock climbing gear that I might want. I'm thinking about improving my beginners rack. I bought my stuff off an old-timer a few years ago. I've had the Metoliuses cleaned up and reslung~ and they're like new now (except that No. 1...). The Camalots are going in the mail to BD to get re-slung today; their mechanisms are also like new~ despite being old and looking gnarly. There are also two wired bliss and one Wild Country~ which are fine~ and which I'm going to re-sling with some cord or slings~ because I can't find who would re-sling them anymore.",May 2020,May 5 2020,2
7549,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,1, I vote for some passive protection like a good set of nuts and alpine draws.  Also looks like you may have some gaps between your red #1 Camalot and your TCU's so filling that in with the appropriate cams.  ,Aug 2012,May 5 2020,5
7550,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,2, Start getting doubles or even tripples from 2 or 3 down.  You can never have too much smaller sized cams in my opinion~ within reason of course.  Extra biners and alpine slings can't hurt.  Id wear the current rope out first before getting a new one.  When you do get a new one I suggest a 70m especially if doing Sierra alpine rock climbs~ it's nice to stretch out those pitches.  ,Apr 2012,May 5 2020,1

7552,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,4, Looks like you may be missing .75 black diamond size. I'm not sure about sizes in Wired Bliss~ Wild Country. I'd first focus on having a decent and complete single set of cams (especially if you are focused on Alpine where you want to reduce weight and may not need a lot of gear). And purchase a rack pack of color coordinated lightweight racking biners. The cam with the exposed cable single stem I'm not a fan of (a partner had some). I'd replace that. Then since you want to focus on Alpine I'd suggest a set of large hexes (8-10)~ lighter and cheaper than cams. .75 and 1 are the most important cams sizes to double up on IMO. Then double up on the small cams. Totems~ Mastercams~ Dragonflies~ Z4s~ Aliens are all good. Get a deal or find out which you prefer. Your Metolius cams are TCUs. (tri cam units). The newer Metolious design inspired by Aliens is the mastercam. Ultralight just means they are light weight versions (your TCUs are pre ultralight). Sierra means mountain range~ you don't need to add the s at the end.,Oct 2011,May 5 2020,1
7553,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,5, At the risk of being cliche~ do a search here and you'll get a few sources for places who will re-sling those cams. CacciaEquipment.com has been my go-to outfit for off-brand items.,Jul 2009,May 5 2020,3
7554,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,6, The wired bliss yellow and red are the same as metolius blue and yellow~ respectively. The yellow wc flexy friend is the next size up from the red wired bliss tcu. However~ that and the larger tcu are the weak points in that rack~ the old style flexible friends are not great to use and I feel like tcus become less useful in the larger sizes. So I would focus on filling in the gaps in between the wired bliss tcu and the red camalot. Since you basically have a double in blue metolius tcu (with yellow wired bliss) it would be better to double in the next size up rather than getting an extra purple metolius. I.e. instead of doubling on metolius 0 and 1~ get metolius 2 and up to yellow camalot (or the equivalent sizes in another brand).,Feb 2006,May 5 2020,1

7560,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,12, Totally out there~ and off the normal recommendations of MP~ but I noticed in my time on the west coast one really abnormal to me thing: West coasters don't place nearly as much passive pro. A great friend of mine suggested that he would rather climb with a small assortment of offset cams instead of a rack of nuts because they're faster to clean and place (allegedly). Aside from a new rope and some small cams you may find great benefit from some offset cams that supplement your nut selection. East of the rockies it seems like we all would rather have a rack of DMM offset nuts or RP's. Your mileage may vary.,Nov 2010,May 5 2020,1
7561,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,13, Some small offset cams and nuts might be a good idea to round things out. I have 30 nuts already~ a mixture of DMM Wall Nuts and Wild Country in most sizes~ but none are offset.,May 2020,May 5 2020,0
7562,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,14," Awesome breakdown~ thanks.  That flexy friend is really awkward - it's definitely not the cam I'd want to grab if I was getting pumped... I feel that Camalots (or the WC or DMM versions) are the standard from green 0.75 and larger. Some might argue down to 0.5. So in those sizes I would recommend the C4 or equivalent. In the smaller sizes there is not as much consensus~ just search ""best small cams"" on Mountain Project and you'll find lively debate.",Feb 2006,May 5 2020,0
7563,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,15, You seem to want light and have taken a liking for Metolius.  Your $500 could get you a set of their ultralight Master Cams. They don't have a thumb loop~ but you probably aren't accustomed to having one~ so that shouldn't be a problem.   You can keep your ear to the ground for a good deal on a pair of inexpensive double/twin ropes.  Or maybe do that next year if the credit renews.  ,Jun 2011,May 6 2020,1
7564,Wellness Fund at work lets me buy $500 of new trad gear,1,16, I spotted some cheap Mammot twins a few days ago that I'm eyeing. They were on sale somewhere for ~$70 a piece or something really cheap like that for a 60m~ $140 total + tax~ IIRC. I'm also working a few plays on eBay for some more mountaineering-ish stuff. The credit does extend to next year but what I'm doing now is a gig job~ so this is my one dip. Next year I'll have more income~ so I can just buy my stuff then~ but I have this money now~ and the season is here~ sooo...I may go for the UL mastercams.

I've almost got a double rack. I also won an awesome ice tool auction on eBay that ran me $200 for two Cobras~ so I may just pop that onto the wellness fund. I don't know.

For a double rack two of each makes it easy to keep track of the sizes with different brands. e.g. you have a green .75 camalot~ and another brand of that size on a green biner too.

7573,BD Technician Approach Shoes,1,0, Have any women out there tried these?  How much did you have to size up?  I bought a pair in my street shoe size~ and my toes were slammed against the front like they were climbing shoes.  I think a half size up won't be enough.  I'm afraid a whole size up might be too wide for my narrow feet.  I would like to hear others' experiences.,Nov 2007,Apr 23 2020,1
7574,BD Technician Approach Shoes,1,1, Hi Kathy~ I also bought these in my street shoe size and they are too small. I ordered online and didn't have the opportunity to try them on. I'm going to list them here for sale~ and buy them again 1 full size up. If you want to buy them let me know~ they are 39.5/8.5 W. I also have narrow feet and purchased these because I read they run narrow. Based on how they fit my feet--with plenty of space across the laces--I don't think 1 size up will be too wide.,Jun 2016,May 5 2020,0
7575,BD Technician Approach Shoes,1,2, Yeah~ I was able to return mine and am waiting for a pair of size 10's to show up.  Size 10!?  I'm not a size 10!  ;^p,Nov 2007,May 6 2020,1
7576,BD Technician Approach Shoes,1,3, I worked at a BD store when these came out. What we noticed in the shop was that we had to size up at least a full size. I don't think you will run into issues with them being too wide~ as they are fairly narrow across the foot. I ended up with Mission LT's because of my wide feet.,Mar 2016,May 6 2020,1
7577,BD Technician Approach Shoes,1,4, So~ the size 10's arrived~ and I wore them all day while working from home.  After work~ I wandered through the woods around the house and rock-hopped in the creek.  These shoes felt a bit stiff out of the box~ but broke in within the first hour.  One size up from my street shoe size still fits slim and close to my foot.  It is just long enough~ but I wanted them to fit snug for bouldery technical approaches.  They are exactly what I was looking for.  Now if only I could use them on an actual approach...,Nov 2007,May 12 2020,1
7578,price of cams,1,0, Now im no expert in this department but recently I've been buying cams off this place and I thought $35 a cam is a solid deal for most cams maybe 45 for the bigger ones. Can someone explain to me why people charge 200 for just #2~3~4 when they're like 240 new and then i get an email saying they're like 250 new at to that i said when they WERE new not anymore. People get butthurt over that.So heres the million dollar question what do y'all expect to pay for USED cams. I think im missing something here....,Mar 2020,May 11 2020,5
7579,price of cams,1,1, Yeah~ 35~ 45 bucks for bd’s~ wc’s~ dmm~ metolious~ aliens. Maybe 65 if it’s a black totem. $50 for the rest of totem. $15 for rigid stems and flex cams. $4 a nut. $20-$25 for older model camalots,Aug 2016,May 11 2020,9
7580,price of cams,1,2, You're not missing anything~ Alec. Many posters on MP with completely unrealistic prices with the seller bumping their thread 10-20 times. It's delusional~ your gear isn't worth half what you're asking!,Sep 2014,May 11 2020,8
7581,price of cams,1,3, It's almost as bad as Craigslist! One thing to keep in mind is that Black Diamond has been rearranging their cam lineup the last couple of years.  First the 3 cam units went away.  The old style C4 Camalots went for unprecedented prices.  Now they are changing out the X4 for the Z4.  We'll see if the adorable cam craze stays after the X4 inventory sells.  ,Jun 2011,May 11 2020,0
7582,price of cams,1,4, I think some sellers set their pricing based on “full price” for new stuff~ ignoring how easy it is to find discounts on pretty much anything other than Totems. I got a set of WC Friends from Campsaver a few weeks ago for $50/cam~ and I see the same cams listed for $50-$55 each used pretty regularly. ,Oct 2017,May 11 2020,5
7583,price of cams,1,5," I've sold a lot of stuff on MP and here's how I factor cams.  I figure that there's a 20% off coupon~ or a 25% off sale or something like that going on for some retailers at any given time~ and if there's not~ wait a week~ there will be.   So~ if a person can get spankin' new cams~ never placed or racked for 25% off~ and your shit's not new~ I usually post used stuff that's in good shape about 45% off retail price (20% below what they can expect to pay new) and for ""well-used"" cams~ they go for 55-60% off or more- depending on how fast you want to move it.   Don't sweat it.  When they're old(er) like me~ they'll figure out time is money and the time they spent on haggling for $10 was worth way more than $10.  If someone wants to move items quickly on the For Sale forum~ then you have to price it so that it will.",Jul 2011,May 11 2020,7

Must higher than that and I'd rather pay 25% for ""actually new.""",Jan 2020,May 11 2020,6
7585,price of cams,1,7, For me personally ive been trying to buy cams for a while now... Like honestly the sole reason why i dont have new cams is because im still in school and climbing trad is expensive. I got on mp and this guy wanted to sell me a number 2~3~4 granted the number 4 did look like it wasn't placed he wanted 170 for the 3 cams. I sent him a dm saying 110 for the 3 which i genuinely thought was a good price. 35 a cam is solid.....I then get an email saying these are 240 new. All in all like I understand its your gear you want to sell but understand this is a buyers market. Ifyou dont make your stuff marketable enough or worth you're while then no one is gonna buy it from you... I dont care how mint it is but like new is still used and isn't solidifying tye face that yea you coukd get most this shit for 25% off somewhere new. So might as well account for it when its used. Honestly in my personal opinion which you dont have to listen to btw.... It doesn't help new trad climbers get used gear it hurts them.,Dec 2019,May 11 2020,1

7589,price of cams,1,11, Yup~ I guess some people are unfamiliar with the concept of supply and demand.  Good advice above about fair used prices being lower than the 20-25% off retail sales that happen quite often for new gear. New sales often include free shipping~ so take that into account too. So figure at least 30-35% off retail for a never placed cam. 35-45% off for almost new. etc. And that's for desirable/modern gear.,Oct 2011,May 11 2020,1

7599,Scrotem Cams (TM),1,8, Red is great~ but the orange really shines when you compare against the width of a BD 2. It’s a lot narrower. Totems are great in flaring cracks too.,Apr 2017,May 11 2020,2
7600,Scrotem Cams (TM),1,9, Love my orange and red totem.  The headwidth difference is significantly smaller than BD UL's.  As noted above~ the flare makes a difference as well.  ,Apr 2014,May 11 2020,1
7601,Scrotem Cams (TM),1,10, As I have pointed out in other threads~ the Orange Totem is only floppy before it is retracted.  Once you pull the trigger~ it is perfectly stable.  Not sure why this misinformation persists. If you want a #2 C4 size with better holding power~ that works in greater flares~ and if necessary~ can hold on two lobes in a funky placement~ buy an Orange Totem.  The only advantages of the C4 is that it is cheaper and works in a passive~ fully open placement.,Jul 2010,May 11 2020,6

7615,Should I cut this rope?,1,4, Yep~ looks like the rope is compromised.    Always a sad~ hard decision.  I am sure quite a few of us have a story about a rope that lasted one day. Years ago in Red Rocks while rapping Prince of Darkness I lost 5 feet of my brand new rope.  When pulling the ropes the tail end created the perfect long bullwhip situation and blew out the end.  Looked like a mop.  The sound was impressive in the canyon too. A year before my buddies brand new rope got horribly stuck on a rap.  New rope now cut short.,May 2008,May 10 2020,7

7617,Should I cut this rope?,1,6, You guys are right~ I'll cut it. It would be nice to have a gym rope when things reopen anyways. It was probably damaged from people top roping off it at a nearby sandstone crag.,May 2018,May 10 2020,1
7618,Should I cut this rope?,1,7, If you decide to cut the rope~ do a little post mortem on the suspect portion.  Cut off the sheath and see if any of the inner fibers are damaged.,Jun 2011,May 10 2020,6
7619,Should I cut this rope?,1,8, Based on the limited info I can glean from the photos~ I would bet there is NO internal damage.

7620,Should I cut this rope?,1,9, I’d keep using it until it gets a core shot there.  Which could be soon or not for a while.  But it means you’ll need to keep an eye on it and that is too much stress for some people. ,Nov 2007,May 10 2020,14

7622,Should I cut this rope?,1,11, please don't cut your rope in half because of a small abrasion in the sheath. shit looks brand new. You're probably just giving the damaged section more scrutiny because you an feel it while you're flaking it.,Aug 2018,May 10 2020,5

7627,Should I cut this rope?,1,16, Yeah there is no way to save that rope. It could  get you off a mountain~ with worries. You could take falls on it. I doubt it fail. But you know you have to retire it~ soon. I have one about like that. I am not even sure how the damage happened. I think it was top roping something over a sloping rough edge? Yeah~ that was it. But I would still use mine except I have about ten ropes so I don't need to. Not saying use yours. But I test mine and check the rope every single time I use it. Before and after. If the outer sheath is gone you should cut it. A little rope fray is not going to snap a rope~ I think?

7632,Should I cut this rope?,2,0," Put the section of rope on the floor~ close your eyes and pick it up. Then feel along the length of the piece or ripe by squeezing the rope's diameter (not by bending it) with your fingers . If~ with your eyes closed~ you can feel a ""softness"" difference and thus can identify the spot by ""softness"" (NOT by the fuzzyness of the sheath)  that means there's at least some loosening of the inner core (not necessarily a break). There's no way to really tell the difference between ""loosening"" of the "" innner core strands and some breakage except to cut into the rope and examine it. (If the breakage is bad~ you'll know it.) So if there's a softness~ consider retiring the rope. But... ...if there's no inner softness~ and about the only way you can tell (if at all) where the spot is~ is by the fuzzyness of the sheath~ then the rope is most probably good to go. As others have said~ watch the spot.  The function of the sheath is to protect the inner core~ and to me it looks as if the sheath on your rope has done exactly that.  I know I've climbed on ropes with a lot worse looking sheath ""fuzzyness"".  Then again~ there's the philosophy for any piece of equipment on which your life might depend...""If you have any doubts~ retire it!""  In climbing the wisdom of this sometimes suddenly appears when your faced with the crux 50 ft from your last piece and your head ""starts to wonder"".  ",Aug 2013,May 11 2020,3

7634,Should I cut this rope?,2,2, disclaimer: there's no way to tell over the Internet~ and if it did fail~ you could die/ be maimed.  that said~ it looks like its probably fine~ just damage to the sheath from doing its job of protecting the core. ropes today are so much stronger than they need to be to do the job of catching a falling body~ that a rope breaking almost never happens. if a rope fails its because it gets cut by a sharp edge or rockfall. obviously your rope is going to be less abrasion resistant in that one spot~ but its just one spot.  If its bothering you or affecting your climbing and you can afford to get a new rope~ just get a new rope~ but it looks safe to climb on to me. as others have said if you do continue using it~ you will need to monitor that spot going forward and reevaluate things as the rope wears further.,Jun 2016,May 11 2020,1
7635,Should I cut this rope?,2,3," Based on the picture~ I would definitely NOT cut that rope. It looks totally fine~ just some sheath damage.  Of course~ it's an internet picture~ and your life~ so the decision is yours~ but in my worthless~ armchair critic opinion~ that rope looks 99% OK.  Just keep an eye on it.

7651,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,10, UL Master or TCU? TCU's just seem outdated~ but becasue they're so different from small cams of 2020~ I'm sure they have their place. Seems like everything besides TCU's and Totems are just an Alien mod. I carry both~ TCUs can be bomber in weird spots like pinscars where nothing else is. ,Jun 2015,Feb 3 2020,4
7652,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,11, Is that your ranking? I'm confused. Yes~ but... 45 years ago we didn't have any and we were fine. 35 years ago we were happy to have any. 25 years ago we took them for granite. 15 years ago we started getting picky and seeing some were better than others. Now I think they are all pretty amazing in terms of quality and functionality. I just tend not to like the aliens and totems as much as some. Really like the BD and DMM stuff. :),Mar 2011,Feb 3 2020,4
7653,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,12, I am in this camp as well. I like the 000 and 00 C3's alot~ then to the 00 and 0 UL Metolius~ black totem to blue totem. ,Oct 2019,Feb 3 2020,2
7654,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,13," I'll play... I think small cams are a specific design group and one of the hardest to get right~ and I've developed some pretty strong opinions on the subject over the years from experience. - Totem Basics: The Original Gangster of the group. I've been made a believer~ these things are badass and the Gold Standard in the small cam game (for now). If you can find one~ buy it~ especially the offsets. I almost always find a place for the blue/green offset in Eldo. They work in small placements where nothing else will~ especially the offsets. For Eldo~ Lumpy~ Turkey Rocks etc~ these are very hard to beat. It's a shame that the Basics aren't made in Spain any more. - Dragonfly: looks like a fantastic cam~ and a much improved Alien. I think these are the premiere small cam range on the market right now. They have the right balance of stiffness and flexibility that I think is ideal in a small cam designed for this application. I have yet to place one~ but I've played with them a bunch and researched the hell out of them. They're top of my list of cams to buy right now. I think that the engineering and feature set on them is superb and the perfect mix for the size and application. DMM's engineering~ machining~ manufacturing and quality control are second to none. I'm a huge DMM fan and have trusted their gear for years and I've never been let down. Here's a great video from one of DMM's design engineers on the Dragonfly 2. Note what he was referring to on the swage and ""buckling to one side"" - I think this is where the Dragonfly excels over the Alien Revolution~ and makes it the best small cam range on the market today. I highly recommend watching the video~ he goes though details most people never thought of. - Metolius Ultralights: The 00~ 00/0~ 0~ 0/1~ and 1 are gifts from the Heavens and proof that God does indeed Love us and want us to be Happy. Everything over the red I don't care for as the stems are a little too flexible for my taste. When I dream of the moment of Nirvana~ when my spiritual body ascends planes~ it looks a lot like the activating force moment of a Metolius 00 Ultralight cam. The head/stem/yoke/trigger design of these smaller sizes is a thing of beauty~ crafted by Savant-Like Gurus whose mastery of small cracks is clearly unparalleled.   - Alien (Revolution): Not a fan~ really. I have the blue one~ equivalent to about a X4 .2 or so~ and I don't care for it that much. It's stem is so flexible that when I pull the trigger back the entire cam wants to flex back toward by hand. It makes placing it require more finger dexterity and finesse to get the trigger pull weight right balanced as you move it into position. The original CCH Aliens didn't have this issue as much~ but they still did to some degree. Outside of that they have a great shape~ great head and I really like the extendable sling~ although the bar-tack makes it so you have to be careful which side you pull to extend it. - WC Zero: The other small cam I'm interested in checking out. I don't know that much about them other than the reviews I've seen~ but they look fantastic and I've always been a fan of Wild Country in general. - C3: I haven't used these that much (intentionally)~ but I wasn't that impressed. I know several people who have broken the plastic cam stem. I don't like the plastic cam stem either~ I think it's width and shape overall makes it's usefulness limited. When these were actively produced they were some of the best in the game~ especially that 000~ but their issues were well known. - X4: Not at all a fan~ they have lost my support after using them for a few years. I have or have had almost all of this set~ with the exception of the green and purple ones (although I have the purple/green offset). They're HEAVY. I don't like the head shape~ the distance between the butt (thumb loop) and the trigger bar/finger tabs/. the width and thickness of the yoke~ or the hardness of the head alloy. That said they are particularly useful in horizontal cracks or placements where you would be concerned about lateral force applied to the stem. They are almost impossible to accidentally trigger as well~ and don't walk particularly bad either. I understand Gunks climbers love them. - TCU: old tech. Walks like Michael Jackson and Johnny Cash had a love child. Hard to place~ large heads~ can be very hard to clean. Not my favorite at all. In their day though they were fantastic~ but their day has passed.   - Z4: WHAT A JOKE! I haven't placed one~ and I don't plan on it. First off is the obvious: they're made in Taiwan. That to me a HUGE red-flag~ as BD is not able to do their own quality control. Did they go cheap on this batch of aluminum? I don't want to be the one to find out. However~ I think the design overall is a joke. The plastic on the stem is intended to make it stiffen when the trigger is pulled~ but that doesn't really work as well as the marketing folks think it does. It still flexes side to side when the trigger is pulled - not as much as the Alien Revolution~ but certainly more than a Dragonfly or a Totem Basic. No extendable sling makes it require a draw for a lot of placements. I don't like my small cams to move at all once I place them~ so I runner almost all of them out~ which is why I strongly prefer an extendable sling. The yoke is too close to the head~ the twisting cable design is ineffective at stopping buckling and makes the triggering action rough. The oversized butt area where the too-large-for-the-cam thumb loop connects with the stem makes it awkward to hold and place. This seems like a cam designed by people who think that all cracks are created equal~ as it has no real specialization or feature set aimed at the small crack application.",Aug 2012,Feb 3 2020,11
7655,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,14," Metolius ultralight masters all the way.  So ridiculously light~ and incredibly good at what they do.  Price is way better than any of the BD stuff~ and still made in the states to boot.  Gotta support the ""local"" manufacters.  Oh~ their service is top notch as well! Totem is probably better function in some placements~ but I havent placed mine enough yet to know.  They are bulkier.  Still~ would rate these so high just because of how much positive I hear about them until I get my own experience.  ",Jun 2009,Feb 3 2020,5
7656,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,15, Imo~ totems are the best small cam down to the black size~ bar none. You can debate that~ but you'll be wrong.  Smaller than that~ it really doesn't matter what cam you use. I personally use C3s~ but don't have a strong preference for them vs other micro micro cams. If anything~ I trust ballnuts and RPs much~ much~ more than green~ purple and grey c3 sized cams. That being said~ I've whipped on green c3s multiple times and they held fine. Same for red ballnuts and offset rps in good rock - never popped on me. ,Mar 2014,Feb 3 2020,6

7658,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,17," Do you like the TCU's becasue they're NOT narrow? What's the appeal? Pros in my opinion/experience: They're more than narrow enough.

And yes the design is ""old school"" but there is a reason they're still around and still being produced~ They work. Also~ I haven't had issues with them walking~ just place em well.

7659,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,1,18, purple c3 hands down best~ then grey/purple offset mastercam and  blue alien or purple master cam/tcu.  green c3's have their moments but the plastic sheath gets in the way sometimes. red x4 is a handy cam for the range im really interested in the red and yellow dragonflys only for the kn rating.  blue master cam is $$ and so is the red c3 for the kn rating and the headwidth. I havent used a black totem much but like it about as much as the red c3( and as an aid piece the best)~ i just dont like the 6kn rating all that much and rather plug  blue mc or #1 c3.,Oct 2013,Feb 3 2020,1

7663,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,2,1, I rack: Met Master 00~ 0 and 1~ BD TCU Yellow~ Totem Black and Blue~ Tricam Black and Pink.  Anything else has to survive Thunder Dome against a racked cam to make it of the shelf.  Totems are a must have.  Tricams are like MacGiver’s personal Leatherman.  So that leaves four spots.  I cannot convince myself the Mastercams are inferior to Dragonflies.  And that Yellow TCU just gets placed all the time. ,Sep 2016,Feb 4 2020,6

7665,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,2,3, I'm still pretty new~ but I've gravitated towards the UL Mastercams and a black totem myself.  My Alien Revos are already getting their lobes worn and trigger wires bent~ sometimes just from being at the top of a pack full of gear!  By comparison~ the UL Mastercams are light~ cheaper~ and feel kind of indestructible.  They are also smaller on the harness/sling than totems~ which is nice when you carry lots of pro because you are a wuss like me.  That said~ the black Totem just feels great in placements~ I don't know why but it just seems to inspire more confidence than the equivalent metolius.  I also have one .4 X4~ which feels well made but is heavy and expensive.  No opinion on the Z4~ C3~ TCUs or other stuff yet. So~ I'd go with UL Mastercams and Totem non-basics at equal rank at this point in my climbing career.,Sep 2018,Feb 4 2020,4
7666,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,2,4, I think it is also important to measure not only pure utility~ but value as well. Everyone wants 10 black totems~ but they are both harder to find and twice as much as a UL MC would be.

7691,The Small Cam Rank/Comparison Page,3,9, I've been climbing on some routes that require micro cams lately. After going through the process of comparing cams I ended up getting the two smallest dragonflies (#1 green & #2 red) to complement C3s and ballnutz™ for the thinnest placements. Sometimes tiny placements are so particular that only certain pieces will fit well~ despite multiple units being within the same range. I took a few falls on the green dragonfly and~ while the piece held~ the trigger wire broke and the lobes were decently damaged. Due to the tight geometry of the lobes~ trigger wires~ and stem I can't replace the trigger wire at home. Still waiting to hear back from DMM regarding repair. The unit did its job but it's a bummer to have gear break on its first use and be out of commission due to tricky repair issues. The green Z4 and the green dragonfly have essentially the same range. I'd be more likely to go with the Z4 in the future. It'll be easier to get them cheaper and potentially easier to repair in the field. ,Jan 2011,Feb 5 2020,2

7718,Boreal making a comeback?,1,0, Hey guys~ I've just been thinking a great deal about Boreal lately...quarantine I suppose!?!? But I remember when they were one of the leading shoe manufacturers out there in the 80's and early 90's with the Vector and Ace (think Green and black...hot as hell).  Sometime in the late 90's they produced a few bombs (The Bamba) comes to mind and they seemed to slip into oblivion here in the US. They began to disappear from the shelves of local and national retail stores across America and they soon slipped from my mind as a viable option...didn't even know if they were still in business.  That being said~ it looks like they have developed some really great shoes here recently and looks like they are back in the game with some more aggressive designs and a new proprietary rubber. HAve any of you out there tried (or own) the new Aces~ Mutants....Sartori...etc..? IF so~ what is the verdict? The old Vectors were one of my favorite shoes back in the day and I would love to see Boreal make a run at the market again. Well built and great performing shoes IMHO,Jun 2008,Apr 11 2020,0
7719,Boreal making a comeback?,1,1, I bought some aces~ so I could try to climb while I had sesamoiditis (bruising of tiny bones in the ball of your foot) I wear size 9.5 street shoe~ and 42-42.5 in most climbing shoes depending on fit/manufacturer. I bought the aces at 10 1/3 size~ to give me a bit of extra room.  They're still just a bit too small~ and the rim of the leather around the ankle cuts into my skin with minimal use.  The rubber is absolutely horrible. I tried TR soloing a .10a slab I have dialed~ and I couldn't even make it off of the ground wearing them.,Jun 2011,Apr 11 2020,0

7723,Boreal making a comeback?,1,5," I've been using a pair of boreal synergy's that I like a lot for crispy near-vertical stuff.  I used my street shoe size and they are dexterous and comfy. Indoors and in greasy limestone caves~ I like almost sock-like shoes (UP leopards). The synergy is the most flexy shoe in Boreal's line I think. The rubber is ""zenith"" I think~ but I don't have a strong opinion about it~ my toes haven't been on granite in ages so it doesn't seem that critical.",Mar 2015,Apr 11 2020,0

7733,Boreal making a comeback?,1,15, I have been using the Boreal Ballet Gold for a couple of years now. Not my first choice for slab climbing or hard sport~ but they rock for chimneys down to about a green C4 size cracks.  The ones I have came with the Quattro rubber shit~ I didn't even climb with them like that~ I sent them directly to the cobbler for some C4 skins.  I also climb in the Ninja slippers that have the new rubber on them. They are better than OK~ but not in the same league as C4 rubber IMO. They get better as you climb on them more and expose the rubber underneath.  I really am impressed with the quality of Boreal shoes~ as compared to the Moccasyms or TC Pros. which either rip apart or de-lam as part of the natural aging of the shoe.  ,Jul 2015,Apr 13 2020,4
7734,Boreal making a comeback?,1,16, I've climbed with the Mutant's about a dozen times now. Bouldering~ some trad and sport and have to say that I really like them. I was nervous about the rubber at first but after the break in period~ I found the rubber to be fine. I think I still prefer XS Grip 2 but this rubber is more than suitable on steep slab and face. I was surprised to find that they seemed to edge better than I originally thought and from the reviews that I had read~ I wasn't expecting too much~ but they have more than proven their ability to edge well for a modified slipper design.,Jun 2008,May 9 2020,0

If you can help me out~ I'll make it worth your while.     Alternatively~ maybe you know someone who worked for Ascent that I could get in touch with?

7761,"Do you have an Ascent ""Rock"" Treadwall?  (aka FitRock~ FunRock)",1,4, Hey mike~   I just got a wall like the one you have.  Did you ever have problems with it being consistently about 20 degrees off of what the computer thought?   Example the program thought it was at -15 (Overhung) but it was actually about +5 (slab)   Also did you have trouble manualy controling it. ie. not using programs but just setting it at 25 degrees and 30 ft per min.    Cant seem to sort that out.   Thanks for your help,Jun 2011,Dec 14 2012,0
7762,"Do you have an Ascent ""Rock"" Treadwall?  (aka FitRock~ FunRock)",1,5," Wow~ old thread!   Welcome to the very tiny club of Ascent Rock owners.   I haven't had the problem you describe with the angle sensor.  It uses mercury switches to set the rotation limits~ then it interpolates the angles in between based on those.  Therefore~ it's possible one of your switches is out of alignment~ which would screw up the angle reading.  Open up the control panel and look for the switches to see if they are right.  Does it start and stop at the right angles?   As far as manual control~ I know of no such capability.  If I want to climb at a set angle and speed~ I create a ""climb"" profile that sticks to that.  I don't know of any other way other than having a partner manually actuate the speed and rotation overide buttons inside the control panel.    Good luck~ let me know how it goes.",Nov 2004,Dec 15 2012,0
7763,"Do you have an Ascent ""Rock"" Treadwall?  (aka FitRock~ FunRock)",1,6," I briefly worked with the Ascent folks~ who were family friends.  I also had one of the prototype systems (serial number 6) which we refurbished with new electronics and donated to a university in New Jersey where I later worked -- unfortunately I understand it was scrapped about two years ago though in good working order.  I wish I'd known.  I would have happily disassembled it and hauled it back up to ground level (it was in a 2nd-level subbasement) to keep it alive...sigh.   After Ascent folded I think the product line was sold to Entre Prises who made a few using Ascent's existing relationship with an overseas contract manufacturer.  The controls on all but the very earliest units (most of which were retrofitted) were designed and built by an amusements company in Salt Lake City even after Ascent relocated to Bozeman.  If you're still stuck I might be able to find their name~ and from my recollection of the people there I bet they still have the code around.   A coworker who is a real embedded-systems whiz also ran into the Ascent Rock at one point and has fond memories.  I wish I could find one in anything close to working order now to fix up for our company's gym.  If you ever get tired of yours~ let me know!   It is too bad that for some reason~ they stubbornly resisted marketing them aggressively to climbing gyms.  They could have had a unit in every gym in the country and two in the larger gyms.  But they just kept trying to ""expand the market"" to other segments while never really tapping the obvious market that would have eaten the things up.  I didn't get it back in 1998 and I guess I never will... this was the only climbing simulator that was ever worth the trouble of even stepping up to.  Multiple high-level US and international climbing competitors trained on it in the few years it was available.  It is a real shame it died~ probably never to return.",Jan 2013,Jan 30 2013,1

I have to say~ as a Mechanical Engineer~ the Ascent Rock is an engineering marvel~ and a real work of art.  I feel very fortunate to have found one~ and I baby it.  I find the video game style interface to be a bit of a pain~ so I've fantasized about building a custom controller to be able to directly adjust speed and angle with knobs that the climber can reach.,Nov 2004,Jan 30 2013,0
7765,"Do you have an Ascent ""Rock"" Treadwall?  (aka FitRock~ FunRock)",1,8, Still having trouble with the angle.  I have measured it and it is about 23 degrees off.  It is consistent though so i have set my programs to take that into account.  I am just not able to make it steeper than 70 degrees because of the -90 limit.  I am getting used to the windows 98 computer.  though the program is quite clunky i have set it up to simulate the MOTHERLOAD as well as having various speeds and set angles.  just wish it were a bit more streamlined.  Where was Steve Jobs when we needed him.   If anybody figures out how to recalibrate the wall let be know.  I contacted a fellow named Cody he gave me an outline i haven't gotten it to work though.

7770,"Do you have an Ascent ""Rock"" Treadwall?  (aka FitRock~ FunRock)",1,13, Unfortunately The Rock no longer has a manufacturer building new machines. When Ascent stopped producing them they were then manufactured by a company called Spectrum Sports based in Utah. Innovative Leisure used to distribute and support the product in the UK and Europe as part of their distribution agreement with Spectrum Sports.   Unfortunately Spectrum Sports also stopped manufacturing the product a number of years ago and since then no one else has taken it on. The majority of the spare parts Spectrum had remaining were shipped to Innovative Leisure who continue to support the product in the UK and Europe but are not able to supply parts~ manuals or service outside of this territory due to insurance issues. They are in a position where they can only support the machines they have supplied.   Sadly with no new manufacturer on the horizon~ very limited spares available and no support outside of Europe it appears to be only a matter of time before the product is no more.,Sep 2013,Sep 16 2013,0

7811,Anyone hang a “hangboard” via rope?,1,0, I’m not able to mount my old hangboard in my apt but I do have visible rafters. So I’ve wondered about ways to hang it in the air. Maybe attached a board on back and rope that or drill two biggest holes and hook it that way like the Problem Solvers boards. Anyone have experience with this? Thinking I could drill holes and make it like the wooden boards (see second pic),Dec 2017,May 8 2020,0

7813,Anyone hang a “hangboard” via rope?,1,2,,May 2008,May 8 2020,0
7814,Anyone hang a “hangboard” via rope?,1,3, The problem with a flexible attachment is that the board may tilt depending on where the attachments are located. Mounting cords from the front will keep it most vertical. If you attach the cords in the back it will have a tendency to turn your holds into slopers. Maybe you could drill eyebolts into the top? Can't you mount a horizontal board on the rafters~ across the peak of the roof? Or otherwise mount directly to the exposed lumber?,Oct 2008,May 8 2020,1
7815,Anyone hang a “hangboard” via rope?,1,4, Thanks. I’ve considered those but these are primarily for fingers and I’m recovering an injury and need bigger grips,Dec 2017,May 8 2020,0
7816,Anyone hang a “hangboard” via rope?,1,5, Thanks. That makes sense. So like tied off in the back and exiting out the front? The rafters are like 12 feet so hanging is my best option. I could buy something like what was linked above but I prefer the bigger holds as I’m recovering from a finger injury ,Dec 2017,May 8 2020,0
7817,Anyone hang a “hangboard” via rope?,1,6, So like tied off in the back and exiting out the front?  I think that would probably work~ or just looped through. Looped through tends to tilt back and forth a little. I have a pair of Tension Blocks (the pictures here might help) which allow me to switch the cord from front to rear or loop it from both sides and they work pretty well hung from the ceiling. Your board should just be a bigger~ monolithic version of the same.,Oct 2008,May 8 2020,0

7819,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,0, Fellow Mountaineers~ I'm finally in the market for my first quality sleeping bag~ intended for 3 season use. After extensive overthinking and research I narrowed it down to the following options (all in size large): - WM Versalite (550 €) - WM Alpinlite (530 €) - Marmot Helium 15 (345 €) I would really love to have a WM sleeping bag but I find myself having a hard time to pay 200 € more for them since I also heard a lot of praise for the Marmot.Btw the price for the WM bags is very good for german conditions right now~ they are never on sale here and usually go for 100 € more.So can you guys help me out? They share similar specs~ the WMs being a bit lighter. All have a pretty generous cut which I like for being a side sleeper and generally a pretty active/restless sleeper.Thank you so much and have a nice weekend!,Jun 2018,May 8 2020,0
7820,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,1, I can't comment on Marmot~ but I have a western mountaineering winter bag and it is awesome~ great for side sleeping and really warm. Compared to other brands that I've used WM puts more down in the bag and are more conservative about temperature ratings. This may explain part of the increased cost. I think you get what you pay for~ in short. For me~ a winter down bag will last a decade or more~ so it was worth it to spend more and get something good quality. Different metrics may be in place for summer bags~ which have a shorter life cycle in my house. The other brand worth looking at is Feathered Friends.,Jun 2014,May 8 2020,1
7821,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,2, I used to work in the outdoors year round~ with backpacking being a significant component of my job. I still do~ but only in the summer now. I've slept outside a lot~ is what I'm saying.  The consensus among my coworkers is that Western Mountaineering bags are the tippy top notch. The same goes for Feathered Friends. Really high quality and craftsmanship. Everybody who has one of those bags always raves about them~ and finds every opportunity to talk about their bag. I believe them. I don't own those bags myself. I have a Marmot bag. It's either the Helium or something close to it. I bought it in 2013 as the lightest and best bag I could afford. I lived in it for like 150-200 days a year for four years~ then something like 30-50 days a year for the last two years.  I think you can probably get like 1000 nights or more out of the bag. Most people don't sleep that many nights outside in their whole lives. Seems legit to me. It kept me warm when I was cold and wet~ and it's still in great shape. The bag is super functional and the build quality is really high. It was much cheaper than WM. I think the performance differential is probably fairly small~ though I believe that the WM and FF bags are probably marginally better. Again~ going off the opinion of my coworkers. WM is a smaller~ more specialized company. If you like supporting those kinds of companies~ it might be worth the extra bucks. When I was 23~ I just didn't have the money to choose which companies to support. I do now~ and I might choose a WM or FF bag when I replace my Marmot~ but I don't think I'll have to for another couple of years. That's a testament to how awesome the Marmot bag is~ in my opinion.,Feb 2014,May 8 2020,4
7822,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,3, I own a WM VersaLite and a Marmot Helium. For the overnight temperatures in the mountains around here~ the VersaLite is closer to a winter bag than a 3 season bag~ while the Helium is a little light for a 3 season bag. I've also owned a couple other Marmot bags over the years. As Danny says~ Western Mountaineering seems a bit more conservative in their temperature ratings than other companies. Both companies make excellent products~ but Western Mountaineering seems to make the best product they can without worrying about cost. Marmot bags are very nearly as good~ for distinctly less money.,Jul 2005,May 8 2020,2
7823,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,4, I’ve owned both and used both extensively. The WM are worth the money in the long run. They hold their loft much longer. Just really good quality in all the materials . And as mentioned when they say a bag is good to such and such a temperature they really are. Marmot bags are nice without a doubt but WM bags are just better in my experience.,Jan 2008,May 8 2020,3
7824,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,5, Thanks for your input guys much appreciated! I guess WM it's gonna be then. It's my dream bag for a long time and I saved up for one so I think I'll go for it! FF is not available in any german shop unfortunately. Which of the two bags would you recommend for me? 3 season use should be true~ winter use is unlikely. I'm a skinny guy btw with 5'10 and 140 lb but as I said I am a side sleeper and value a bit of extra room.,Jun 2018,May 8 2020,0
7825,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,6, I have an alpinlight and a mega light. Both are nice~ very  roomy and light. Mega is perfect down to freezing but the alpin works for the shoulder seasons when it dips a bit below freezing.,Jan 2008,May 8 2020,1
7826,3 season sleeping bag - Marmot vs WM can you help me chose?,1,7, Hey everyone~ Just this morning I saw that Globetrotter is doing 20% on all sleeping bags~ including WM. So I pulled the trigger on an alpinlite for 480 € which is kind of a steal. Pretty stoked to get it! They did not have the Versalite so I did not have to make this decision but also an Apache MF~ might order one as well and compare them side by side. I'll report back~ cheers!,Jun 2018,May 9 2020,0
7827,Tri-cams and hexes,1,0, I am a new trad climber and generally only climb trad routes that are pretty easy.  My current rack consists of black diamond stoppers and an assortment of SLCDs.  I do not~ however~ currently own any tri-cams or hexes.   Is it worth getting any tri-cams or hexes for a beginning rack? What benefits do they give versus SLCDs and normal nuts?,Jul 2019,May 6 2020,0
7828,Tri-cams and hexes,1,1, Only if you have a limited budget. Virtually no one carries hexes and tricams are fiddly and not worth your time.  Get offset nuts instead!,Sep 2010,May 6 2020,5
7829,Tri-cams and hexes,1,2, You should look up tricams in the forums. There have been many~ many discussions about them. They have their haters~ lovers~ and in-betweens. You can read the discussions and decide for yourself. No need to rehash it here~ although it seems inevitable now that you've thrown the meat in the dog pit.,May 2019,May 6 2020,10
7830,Tri-cams and hexes,1,3, I don't have hexes~ but I'm a member of the church of the immaculate tricam~ and I'm here to proselytize! Tricams: 1) fit rare funny little pockets where nothing else will 2) are the hands-down best pro for horizontals~ especially shallow/flaring ones 3) Are lighter and cheaper than cams~ and thus supplement cams well for when you run out of cams or want to reserve cans for later on a pitch 4) are euphoria-inducing when you set a perfect pink placement 5) are just generally bad-ass,Oct 2017,May 6 2020,52

7834,Tri-cams and hexes,1,7, I kinda like them~ and stacking the biggest ones amuses me to no end.  The wired Viamont ones can be handy at times since the wire acts as a spring to hold it in place~ but they catch on things while racked and can’t be placed passively.  And the smallest needs 3 hands to remove due to the wire. Edit:  Apparently the #5 can be used as an improvised rappel device~ should you drop yours while bailing off a wall due to running out of gear with an approaching storm.  Happened to Mal Daly years back~ and he recounted it on either RC or ST.  I forget which.,Jun 2019,May 6 2020,6
7835,Tri-cams and hexes,1,8, I own black~ pink~ and red non-evo tricams. I carry them if I think I'll need extra pro for an anchor~ if the pro is likely to be weird~ or if I want doubles without racking up more cams. They're definitely handy for protecting weird~ pebbly cracks and not a bad way to fill out a rack~ as they don't weigh much. Your second may hate you though.,Feb 2012,May 6 2020,3
7836,Tri-cams and hexes,1,9, Small Tricams are great depending on where you climb~ Hexes will collect dust in your closet.,Jul 2014,May 6 2020,12
7837,Tri-cams and hexes,1,10, I have both. Haven't carried my hexes in years. I'll bring tricams in Eldo when shit gets really weird and literally nothing else will fit. I love my tricams~ but very rarely use them.,Apr 2007,May 6 2020,3
7838,Tri-cams and hexes,1,11, Dude: you won't need any Tri-cams in the Rockies.  I've climbed up and down the American Rockies for 27 years and never needed a Tri-cam. I OWN them~ but never needed them.  Your cash is much better spent getting camming devices.  I also grew up with hexes. I only have 4 Torque nuts (a kind of hex) now~ because SLCD's are so far superior to them for every day use.  If you go east to climb~ they become much more valuable. But why climb out east when you live in the sub-Mecca of climbing?  Yosemite being Mecca.,Jul 2015,May 6 2020,2
7839,Tri-cams and hexes,1,12, I have very rarely used my hexes since I got a full rack of cams. My tricams on the other hand~ I still use all the time. I only have the black~ red~ two pinks~ and brown camp tricams and I have a double rack of cams~ but it still tend to find at least one place on each route where one of the tricams works better than a cam. Maybe that is because of the nature of the rock near me. ,Oct 2018,May 6 2020,1
7840,Tri-cams and hexes,1,13, I will only speak to tricams since I look like a moron trying to place hexes. I don't ever think they are a requirement to own but if you get good with them they have their place. If your second hates you when cleaning I personally think your placement was likely too tight. For days when I'm feeling doing something weird for fun I'll do entire climbs with a double set of tricams. Although at this point unless the crack gets wider than the blue (biggest I own) it doesn't feel like a big challenge beyond using cams. Also~ I tend to bring them before a second set of cams when the approach hike is longer. Especially if the climbing isn't technically hard. And honestly~ even though I'm one of those that probably like their tricams too much~ I'd say unless you're really strapped for cash make sure you have your cams in all sizes you need first and a second set available either from you or your partner before tricams. If you don't have a partner with gear and you only have enough money for a set of tricams for the foreseeable future~ and find yourself running out of .3 to 1 be size cams. Then tricams are a decent solution. Oh and if you want to place them one handed the newer models (both Evo and standard in normal sizes) have a stiffer runner which is cool in those smaller sizes.,Dec 2013,May 6 2020,4
7841,Tri-cams and hexes,1,14, Depends on what I’m climbing and where I’m climbing. Hexes are light and tricams are light. Cams of the same size are a bit heavier. If I’m climbing at my limit~ I’m never reaching for a hex. If I’m traveling 6+ miles and am unsure if I’ll need extra gear~ I’ll pack the hexes to serve as a double for a single set of cams. Hexes are however my least used gear. They are cheap if you are struggling to buy enough cams. Tricams come whenever I know there is a bunch of horizontals. ,May 2015,May 6 2020,2
7842,Tri-cams and hexes,1,15, Medium tricams (red~ brown~ blue) can be a nice multi-functional replacement for large stoppers.,Apr 2018,May 6 2020,1

7850,Tri-cams and hexes,2,2, I really like the DMM torque nuts. My home area is central NC with quartzite~ but I also took them to Vegas and placed them a lot there as well. Maybe it's because I tend to stick to moderate climbing with larger irregular cracks? ,Feb 2017,May 6 2020,0
7851,Tri-cams and hexes,2,3, Tricams are the jam for multipitch gear anchors. I carry pink and red instead of larger nuts.,Mar 2012,May 6 2020,2
7852,Tri-cams and hexes,2,4, A well-placed Tricam makes my engineer brain feel all warm and fuzzy. If I had to choose a piece of gear to catch a huge fall~ Tricam all day. You wouldn’t get it back but it would hold. ,Oct 2017,May 6 2020,12
7853,Tri-cams and hexes,2,5, For me the thing about Tricams is there’s no real reason NOT to bring them.  They’re light as shit so you won’t really notice they’re there and they’ve saved my ass enough times that I don’t regret always bringing them even if I don’t end up placing them.  This does NOT apply for hexes.  They’re big~ bulky~ relatively heavy for a full set~ and you can hear them from a mile away.  Only time I ever use them now is for setting TR Anchors.,Jul 2014,May 6 2020,10

7857,Tri-cams and hexes,2,9, I have a set of hexes and tricams.  I almost never carry my hexes;  they are big~ loud and obnoxious and rarely necessary.  Conversely~ I almost always carry my tricams.  They are very useful in New England.  ,Mar 2019,May 7 2020,1
7858,Tri-cams and hexes,2,10, I just started carrying tricams this year~ and I like them; I feel there are enough shallow~ horizontal cracks at Devil's Lake to warrant them. I also carry a few hexes; I used to carry a bunch~ then I realized I only ever placed the same three or four~ typically as passive offsets. ,Jul 2014,May 7 2020,1
7859,Tri-cams and hexes,2,11,,Apr 2019,May 7 2020,0
7860,Tri-cams and hexes,2,12, I carry black-brown on one biner. Light and small enough that there’s no reason not to. In my opinion white is a bit too time consuming to clean and pretty weak too and bigger than brown seems less bomber and gets heavier compared to cams. ,Jan 2012,May 7 2020,3
7861,Tri-cams and hexes,2,13, I’m in the west. I don’t carry tricams at all anymore. I bring a few of the largest hexes only on climbs with long approaches that need multiples of big sizes (much lighter than cams) and I typically use them in the anchors. When I’ve climbed in the Gunks it’s a different story. Tricams work great there.,Oct 2011,May 7 2020,1
7862,Tri-cams and hexes,2,14,,May 2019,May 7 2020,6
7863,Tri-cams and hexes,2,15, People always pushing tricams in the gunks but I don't think I ever see anyone climb above 5.10 with them.   I'm sure there are a few small outliers that have one spot for one tricam but the idea that tricams are necessary (or even worthwhile) in the gunks feels like a myth with modern gear. ,May 2011,May 7 2020,0

The sedimentary rock is more suited to it.  I lived in Truckee 25 years. Some had Hexes and Tricams. Tricams work great above 10'000 ft in the High Sierra above Bishop where the rock is much more course and friable and the cracks shallow and flaring. I have been happy to have a couple of small Tricams for pockets in Toulumne and Courtright granite and found good use for a red one on the crux aid move on Washington's Column. The pink and red ones are worth the weight any time~ and I prefer the larger sizes for backcountry trips where every ounce counts and I am not climbing at my limit.",Dec 2019,May 7 2020,3
7867,Tri-cams and hexes,2,19, I think it's worth carrying a tricam or two in the most popular sizes (e.g. pink) on moderate multipitch because they're light~ they make good anchor pieces~ and they sometimes (rarely) are the best piece you can place. The biggest knock against tricams is they are harder to place on lead than nuts or cams. Doing some moderate alpine climbing? Tricams are excellent. Trying to redpoint your overhanging singlepitch project? Not so much.,Aug 2017,May 7 2020,5

7872,Tri-cams and hexes,3,4, The more important question is which tricams vs. which hexes.  I don't use hexes~ but I have a full set of tricams and get the most use out of pink (of course!)~ black~ red~ orange~ and the #6 yellow (for anchors).  The middle spectrum tricams I really don't seem to ever use.  The green tricam looks so beautiful but I've never placed it ever.  I think I may have used the #1.5 once and the #2 once.  I imagine the same is true of hexes; certain sizes are practical and others aren't. The great thing about either tricams or hexes though . . . you can usually get some used ones on ebay for cheap! ,May 2018,May 8 2020,1
7873,Tri-cams and hexes,3,5, Good point. I only own black through brown tricams. I would say I place pink the most~ then red~ then probably a tie between black and brown. I occasionally think about getting other sizes~ but I'm not sure if they will get much use. ,Oct 2018,May 8 2020,1
7874,Tri-cams and hexes,3,6, I use the pink and red here and there and like them~ but I seldom use the larger ones. They just don't seem to seat in a placement as well as the two small ones.,May 2019,May 8 2020,0
7875,Tri-cams and hexes,3,7, The hardest Southeast climber I know swears by them.  Yeah no doubt~ tons of north carolina climbing is almost impossible without them~ but they are always championed in the gunks and I honestly think It's 99% older climbers pulling on 5.7 and newer climbers trying to save money.  No shade on either group~ but the mystique they elicit up here is undeserved with new gear. ,May 2011,May 8 2020,1
7876,Tri-cams and hexes,3,8, Spot-on. Case-in-point: at the top of Healy’s Haunted House~ at the start of the last pitch~ the standard route beta directs climbers to the right of a bulge~ up~ and then work your way back left. If you decide to go straight up the bulge~ you do so with scant pro~ as there’s nothing close by—UNLESS you have tricams. There's a flaring crack below the bulge that resists placement of any other pro. But tricams—especially the larger ones—are perfect. We usually build a tricam anchor there. Climbing this bulge~ and the other two that follow~ is the money pitch. And there are other climbs in Red Rock where tricams fit in huecoes that reject any other pro. Hate tricams if you like (they are bulky to rack)~ but they have their place. ,Apr 2013,May 8 2020,3

7878,Tri-cams and hexes,3,10, All comes down to personal preference and where you climb. Lots of people use both so obviously they have some benefits. Tricams are awesome for horizontal cracks and weird little pockets. They place as fast as cams in horizontals and are bomber. There are some areas and routes that love them. Climbing in areas like red rocks with long rope stretcher pitches and gear anchors they are wonderful to have at the anchor as they are suuuper versatile. Hexes are just plain bomber and cost effective. Some rock just doesn't take cams well and hexes are great. Slippery limestone and weird upward flaring cracks are some examples. We have some slippery limestone where I'm at and cams can sometimes be suspect. There's a reason some areas people reach for passive pro first where relying on rock friction could be a bad idea. Basically: - A lot of areas hexes and tricams will not be missed - Some areas they are somewhat useful but cams are better - Some areas they are a great addition to your rack,May 2018,May 8 2020,3

On a lot of climbs in his range they will probably get buried and be hard/impossible to retrieve. Coffin Crack had TWO pinks fixed when I climbed it BITD.

7885,Grand Wall Equipment,1,1, Can only speak to the hook set and the narrow cam hook used on probably about 5-10 grade V walls ~C2/C2+. I used the narrow cam hook for a fair few walls~ no issues but it is a bit skinnier (and flexes a bit more~then the moses equivalent) but didn't have any issues with inverted placements) which I've eventually bought out of an abundance of caution. Seems more then capable. The hooks were fine~ but that they come with pre-sewn slings is great (and low profile HMWPE) makes me want to get a bunch of my other gear slung. Haven't done any routes with large amounts of hooking so probably only place ~20-30 times~ no issues. Had a few minutes with the uAdjust~ it didn't seem great compared to an alfifi/cam buckle adjustable daisy/connect adjust type lanyards. YMMV,May 2016,Apr 21 2020,1
7886,Grand Wall Equipment,1,2, I have a uAscend which I believe is a knock off of an older model of the the Ural-Alp/Ushba basic ascender.  The Ural-Alp is better in several small ways.  The Ural-Alp is made of titanium and is lighter and the cam is shaped to prevent cutting of the rope.  The uAscend cam is not shaped which is how older models of the basic ascender were made.  Also the tolerances of the basic ascender are better than the uascend. My model of Ural-Alp basic ascender is 10.05 and is $55 on ebay.  The uAscend is about $45.  I think both are better than the camp lift for $65.  All three are EN 567.  Testing show the camp lift holding smaller loads before slipping.

7890,Rope Access/ Fall Protection,1,0," Hello~ I'm interested in putting together an ""all purpose"" fall protection ~ tree climbing~ rock climbing kit for safety and work access. I have no experience rock climbing~ but spend a lot of time on ladders~ on roofs~ and in bell towers for my work as a maintenance man. My immediate need is for fall protection on a roof. I can buy a one hundred dollar OSHA compliant fall protection kit that has everything I need for roof fall protection. The system utilizes a steel plate that is nailed to rafters near the ridge beam of the roof. I'd prefer to have a rope access system up and over the roof (or up and over a tree branch) that gives me protection or access from the ground up. I still don't understand why the OSHA compliant kit only protects you after you've climbed on and off a ladder and up to the peak of your roof. I realize that I may be looking for a new toy in all of this. I've spend a lot of time on roofs and in high places with no fall protection and I'm sure roofers would think I'm acting like a chicken boy. Here's a post from stack exchange that has answered my question: ""If you're not a climber~ then don't buy a climbing rope for doing roof repairs. If you're going to buy a rope for a very specific job~ then you should get the right equipment for the job.

7897,Rope Access/ Fall Protection,1,7, Work positioning vs Fall pro vs Rope Access vs rock climbing is all different. Depending on your experience and knowledge you can use the last two (RA/RC) pretty well for all things. You probably won’t meet the OSHA or site standards for a job site. But you can use them on your own for personal work around your house/etc. if you have the likelihood of falling/becoming stuck/need a rescue the first thing I would recommend if making sure you system is rigged for rescue and you have someone who can lower you to the ground. Putting yourself in a position that fire/emt’s Have to be called to get you is not what you should plan on. If you are using a static line/climbing harness for a roofing job You have a few options.- Descender (Grigri~ Rig~ etc): easy to self rescue~ but you don’t want to work with excess slack in the system so it requires constant tending.- Backup (ASAP/Duck/shunt/etc): using this alone is a fine capture device for low angle work (if you don’t need to meet OSHA standards). The issue come in the event you fall and require a rescue if the system isn’t rigged to lower. your “all in one” kit likely will cost thousands of $ and you need a lot of experience to know what you are doing. Taking a 40 hour rope access course or being a AMGA SPI doesn’t make people professionals and most know enough to get themself into a lot of trouble~ but not out of it.  Depending on your situation and why you are using these things (personal vs occupational)~ I would be more than willing to give you specific advice for a specific job. ,Dec 2011,May 7 2020,1

7912,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,1,3, OP - spend some time on the Fixe website and you will learn all you need to know about metals.  It's still very easy to buy plated steel bolts AND hangers~ but there's no reason to use them anywhere any more~ except that the route developer is a cheapskate who cares little for the long term safety of his route.,Jul 2009,Nov 24 2015,0

7914,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,1,5," It's worth noting that the ""galvanic corrosion"" caused by mixing metals effects one metal at the expense of the other. That's in fact how zinc plating works - the zinc is slowly sacrificed to protect the steel underneath. Eventually the plating is consumed and you have the raw steel~ which then corrodes. In the case of mixing plated and stainless components in an anchor~ it's the plated ones that will suffer. The most important component to protect is the bolt shaft itself~ which is exposed to the most corrosive environment - the inside of the bolt hole. If the bolt and hanger are stainless~ then as kennoyce says~ it's probably fine in most dry-ish climbing areas. Any metallurgists out there know the actual galvanic potential between 304 stainless and zinc and/or grade 5 carbon steel?",Aug 2009,Nov 24 2015,1

7916,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,1,7," I think the reason why many people are concerned about rusting and galvanic corrosion is that not all plated hardware is created equally.  There is some really good plated hardware such as the grade 5 and grade 8 carbon steel bolts that Powers uses in it's ""5-piece"" bolts.  Then there is the really crap stuff you see with many wedge bolts and quick links.   I strongly recommend using stainless whenever possible.

7925,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,1,16," We need to wrap our heads around a higher standard for hardware. It's coming. The fact is~ very soon~ you will be considered a rogue bolter if you are using plated hardware~ even in the desert. Certainly~ already~ any European equipper would look sideways at your work. I've certainly placed my share of plated stuff~ and made even worse hardware decisions before our state of knowledge got to where it is now~ and I understand the under-funded developer mentality as well as anyone alive. But if you pry off a block in Indian Creek or an arid limestone crag in Nevada~ you'll find damp dirt behind it. The inside of a bolt hole is the same. A long-lasting anchor in rock outdoors simply needs to be stainless. The more remote your crag~ the more important it is to get it right the first time~ because no climbing coalition is going to be following along behind you re-equipping your route~ ever. 30 years is not that long.   The main problem for US developers right now is that 1/2-inch stainless-steel sleeve bolts~ of any brand~ are extremely expensive~ while 1/2-inch plated sleeves are/were quite cheap. But the price gap has narrowed~ now that the tried-and-true plated Powerbolt is discontinued~ replaced by the more expensive Powerbolt Plus. If a 1/2-inch stainless sleeve bolt became available that was just a little cheaper~ we could make a fairly painless transition to all-stainless.   Currently~ you have viable options. Good quality 3/8-inch stainless wedge bolts work very well in a lot of rock types (including most limestone)~ and are very affordable - about $5 per bolt/hanger placement. If you're financially challenged (like most of us) and have reasonably hard rock~ that should be your low-end bolt of choice. Make sure you know how to place wedge bolts correctly - don't over-torque and do use Loc-tite on the nuts - and consider a different bolt for first-bolt placements (which tend to loosen)~ inverted placements~ or bolts you expect to get particularly rough treatment. 1/2-inch stainless wedge bolts are super burly~ work in even softer rock~ and are surprisingly affordable. A lot of the re-equipping done in the New River Gorge uses these. You'll need hangers with 1/2-inch (or 12mm) holes.   RE types of stainless~ it's my understanding that in Europe~ standard construction codes specify 316 when stainless is called for. Unlike here~ 304 is rarely used. Hence~ 316 isn't much more expensive than 304 in Europe - the small amount of molybdenum in the alloy doesn't really make the raw stock much pricier. It's more of a demand problem in the US that makes 316 so much more expensive than 304. That's an important issue. 316 is much more resistant to the pitting corrosion that is the likely ""weak-link"" mechanism for degradation of a stainless-steel rock-climbing bolt. But even 304~ to the best of my limited knowledge~ really should put us on a good path where new bolts in non-coastal climbing areas will be good (at least corrosion-wise) for 100 years.   Anyway~ there are smart and dedicated people working on this problem. If everyone stopped using plated bolts and hangers and demand for stainless equipping hardware went up~ that would help bring costs down and new products to market.",Aug 2009,Dec 1 2015,1

7935,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,2,5, Marine and tropical environments definitely pose a next-level threat to climbing anchors. Even in cool climates like northern California~ it appears that stress corrosion cracking occurs. This is a super-scary type of corrosion~ very fast (bolt failure after 3 years) and extremely destructive (new-looking bolts failing at less than body weight). For these areas~ titanium glue-ins are the only safe bolt. Rapbolting.com just started distributing for the British company Titan Climbing~ who makes titanium bolts.,Aug 2009,Dec 2 2015,0

My research led me to understand that SCC was a process believed to have a temperature threshold. Just like paper will never catch fire no matter how long you hold it next to the heat vent in your car~ SCC will simply not occur below a certain temperature~ regardless of high chloride concentrations. Pitting and crevice corrosion may occur~ but those are completely different things~ far less catastrophic than SCC. Yet the temperature threshold seems to be lower than originally thought. The bolt failures in Thailand were quite shocking and theoretically interesting to the industrial-accident-analysis community when Angele Sjong (a climber and professional materials-failure analyst) released her paper on that topic~ which I assume most of you geek posters (like me) have read.

7945,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,2,15," Sorry to resurrect dead thread~ but it's right on target. Couple comments and a query.   304 isnt marine grade because underwater the passive chromate oxide cant reform. Lots of talk about this on boating forums for anchors (which is how I discovered it - google 'stainless anchor' and you'll find the nexus of climbing and boating (also for knots :).   As for 304 or 316 and SCC in 'marine' or 'chloride' environments~ here in Ontario on limestone there's some slabby faces of incredibly dark black rock (stained black by runoff) - this runoff is full of tannins and other soil components from the cliff environ above~ which may include chloride.   This creates a nice face angled at the sun~ on a 38C day~ with black rock~ thats moist with runoff. It's quite possible that the bolt hole would be full of chloridated moisture and cooking at 60C.   Like very slow speed limits near schools that apply even in the dead of night~ getting people used to the speed in the area (""always go slow in this area at all times"")~ perhap we should be using titanium bolts because of the 1 in 100 chance that the bolt you place will be in such an environ (there's a heck of a lot of examples of this in Southern Ontario at Devil's Glen and The Swamp climbing areas - black streaked (from runoff) rock~ that faces the sun for hours a day).   That said~ getting people to 304 is a good start. Here I think everyone's on the 304 train nowadays for the most part~ and reequipping continues apace.   Beware: the fixe steel gym anchor biner (with the hex-unlocked locking bar) was advertised by MEC (Canada's answer to REI) as stainless~ as were a few other fixed hardware products. I got them to pull and redo their descriptions as they're just plated steel. (ie for gyms~ not outside.)   My question: There are often missing hangers (and nuts..) found on routes -- how bad is it to place a stainless quicklink or hanger on a plated bolt/anchor? Wont the plated bolt suffer the corrosion (according to the electrochem series) in this circuit? (Which is actually the OP's question~ but I dont think it got answered completely - he went and changed his question in his next post...). Thanks.",Apr 2011,Apr 19 2016,0

7948,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,2,18," Sounds like people should be advised to carry plated hangers instead~ to act as the sacrificial anode as they can be inspected visually when the bolt cant - or~ perhaps something even slightly more electrochemically active than plated~ but I cant think of something that would be safe and act in this way.    Better to replace the bolt~ obviously~ but the diff between adding a hanger and a nut and redrilling is huge (ie ""experienced bolter with a drill and related gear"" vs ""someone who happens to have a nut~ hanger and wrench handy).    So what's the solution without dipping into paranoia?   Does Titanium corrode at all (I am sure in some acidic situation it must -- acid rain musta been a bigger problem for climbers in the 70s/80s!) - so again same issues with Ti with SS304/316 hanging on it?",Apr 2011,Apr 20 2016,0

7950,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,3,0, Since there seems to be a fair amount of metals knowledge in this forum~ maybe I could ask about the specific electrode potential between stainless steel and zinc~ and between SS and carbon steel~ once the zinc is gone.    To my knowledge~ the only really powerful galvanic corrosion that's been noted in climbing hardware has been between steel bolts and aluminum hangers - famous case at Index~ WA~ I believe. Maybe one of you experts could interpret some numbers from the galvanic charts~ indicate which metal gets sacrificed (never the stainless steel~ correct?)~ and give some real-world examples of how powerful the galvanic corrosion can be.    Also~ RE SS's passivation layer (mostly chromium oxide) not being replaced in the oxygen-poor environment underwater~ why~ then~ is there plenty of oxygen to rust the iron? In other words~ why can iron oxide form~ but not chromium oxide?    Also~ what kind of corrosion was observed in the stainless bolts whose holes filled with water?,Aug 2009,Apr 20 2016,0
7951,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,3,1," Jeff~ there's all kinds of surface effects going on with corroding metals that makes it a lot more difficult to predict how ""bad"" a particular metal pair will be~ compared to just looking up the metals' relative oxidation potentials.  Aluminum is a nice~ quirky example: from the tables it looks reactive as hell - our biners should self destruct every season - but it is usually protected by a tight oxide surface layer.  Probably analogous to the oxide(s) that passivate stainless steel (but that's getting beyond my level of familiarity~ so I'll shut up at this point).

7958,Zinc plated va stainless steel~ anchors chains and quick links,3,8, Wow those are some pictures.   So in replacing hangers~ it's terribly bad to mix metals? How do you replace a missing hanger not knowing what the target is? Should we be carrying all PS hangers now so they remain the visible sacrificial anode in the system that can be replaced (vs invisible corrosion inside the hole) - and if you do meet a PS bolt at least you're not mixing metals.   So is the official position now to carry PS hangers? Or throw in a zinc washer as sacrificial anode? I dont even know where to find PS hangers~ here in Canada MEC (~REI in USA) has 3-4 types of hangers but they're all SS304.   (And what's the scoop on Aluminum leaver biners on PS or SS hangers?

This is more when you find a missing hanger - does screwing on a SS hanger and nut now accelerate the corrosion drastically because you didnt know it was a PS bolt?

7995,North Face or Mountain Hardwear for Bivy Tent,1,2, I’m curious why you write the MH will be more expensive than TNF? Is it because TNF has an included vestibule and the MH one would be extra? Mountain Hardware currently has 25% off everything~ if you go to their website. So the AC 2 would be $487.50~ not including the vestibule.

7996,North Face or Mountain Hardwear for Bivy Tent,1,3, Based solely on browsing the websites  1) MH is 10k water resistant vs TNF's 5k which might sway me if there was a chance I'd ever see rain.  2) MH's side panel guyouts look more bomber to me.

7998,North Face or Mountain Hardwear for Bivy Tent,1,5, In order of answers:  - I'm 5'10 so shouldn't be too big of an issue on height.  - Due to discount codes available to me/store credits etc. The MH costs more due to the vestibule cost.  - Now that I think about it more~ I see the point that a vestibule is not highly important in a tent meant for minimalist bivies on small areas.  That being said I would also like to use it for winter camping and the vestibule would be better.  Currently only own a shitty 3 season tent which has gotten me by in most situations.  Looking for a winter tent that can handle storms and will function as an option for technical route objectives in the next couple years.  I want something I can use in the Alaska range next season~ but I would also like something versatile enough for bike packing~ back packing~ ski touring~ could be used as a 1 man etc.  I guess something more storm worthy with wet snow than a BD first light~ and small enough to use on technical terrain where a pyramid tarp would be too hard to pitch.  Open to advice on how to approach this purchase~ but considering these tents due to cost (would pay close to 40% off retail on either) and current availability... ,Jun 2017,May 4 2020,0

8009,LS Futura Fit,1,0, I got a pair of size 40.5 futures~ I Normally wear a 41 in LS but I ordered the 40.5 to try given I'm a 42 in street sizing. I tried them on and I was surprised that my toes slide around inside of the shoe~ anybody else have this with these shoes? I just feel like my foot should feel more snug inside than it does,Mar 2020,Apr 29 2020,0
8010,LS Futura Fit,1,1, I found it fits about right or if anything slightly small for me. Can wear a size 42 solution~ but a size 42 futura was painful. Currently climb in a 42.5 futura which is still very snug. Most other LS I wear 42.5 also~ except for my 43 tc pros. Maybe it doesn’t fit your foot that well? Perhaps the LS genius would work better since you can adjust the fit with the laces. I would also try a size down~ because they definitely stretch a bit ,Feb 2020,Apr 29 2020,0
8011,LS Futura Fit,1,2, You need to downsize more. I wear 45 street / 41 in Futura~ sometimes 40.5. They should be very uncomfortable and hard to get on when new. These shoes take a few sessions to break in~ and it can be uncomfortable until the heat/sweat/pressure from your feet start to stretch and mold the shoes to your foot. If you're wearing a 42 street shoe~ you should be wearing at least a 39 in Futura for a good fit. I've had around 15 pairs of this shoe since it came out~ and I've worn it in 3 different sizes over the years. The way the shoe feels out of the box doesn't indicate how it will feel once you break them in. Think of a baseball mitt when it's brand new~ very stiff and uncomfortable. After a few years of use it breaks in and molds perfectly to your hand. Italian climbing shoes are similar~ but break in faster. ,Jul 2010,Apr 29 2020,0
8012,LS Futura Fit,1,3, I wear a 45 street~ 44 tc pro~ 43 mytho~ 44 solution~ 44 miura lace and 43 Futura. They are tight~ but I think if I went larger I’d have heal slop. Might be too soon to tell~ I only have a couple days on them. Definitely think the no edge is sweet. So I went down two sizes from 45 to 43~ so maybe a 40 would work for u Minh. ,Mar 2017,Apr 29 2020,0

I thought the futura was too tight  but my feet are a little wider than average. so if you have average width feet~ that sizing might work. I tried to break my futuras in but what ended up happening was i would stand on an edge and it would cause pressure on the side of my toe~ like bad painful. best of luck,Oct 2017,Apr 29 2020,0

8015,LS Futura Fit,1,6," Street shoe is 9.5-10 US size. Default LS size is 40.5 - painful initially but perfect after 4-6 sessions. Futura in 40.5 felt ""too comfy"" out of box - a little tighter than a broken in solution/miura/testarossa of same size. Futura is synthetic so didn't stretch much~ and only conformed to my foot shape. 41 would work but might be a bit sloppy for really steep technical climbing. LS TX4 - 42.5 LS Mutant trail shoe - 43.5 Solution - 41 for all day. 40.5 for performance. Futura - 40.5 Testarossa - 40.5 Miura VS - 40.5 TC Pro - 40",Mar 2015,Apr 29 2020,0

8019,Thinking about my first rack,1,0, First of all~ I have read past threads about this~ but I wanted to ask anyway from my particular POV.  Any help appreciated! I have been focusing more on trad and have begun to think about building a rack.  I have been using other people's gear and might want to start getting some of my own.  My main questions are about cams~ especially considering some of the new stuff available I will mostly be climbing in the northeast/New England~ and am looking for reliability and durability~ more than weight or cost savings I was looking at C4s as that is what I have mostly been using~ and they are available across a very wide range of sizes.  Alternatively~ a combination of smaller Z4s and larger Ultralights could make sense. Finally~ some people rave about Totems~ although I have never used them~ and they are available across a wide range of sizes (although not as wide as C4s) So - Option 1~ 2~ or 3? Or a wildcard I haven't thought of??? THANKS!!!,Sep 2017,Apr 28 2020,0
8020,Thinking about my first rack,1,1, Mastercams are the cheapest and are pretty darn good. Also the lightest besides TCU’s but I don’t like those. What you should do is get one brand’s full size range~ and then get an inbetween size from a different brand. For example~ get C4’s and supplement with totems~ master cams or wild country as those three are all about a half size different than C4’s. For cams size around BD .5 (purple) and below the width of the axle makes a difference~ so get the z4’s~ mastercams or totems definitely. You said weight doesn’t matter to you much~ but a lighter rack does help the send no matter what anyone says. Gravity~ man... anyway. Get an Ultralight #4 as it’s quite the weight savings. The #3 also if you want. Maybe the 2 in the future. Keep in mind~ carabiners are one of the biggest weight savings on a rack so choose wisely something that is cheap~ light~ easily replaceable. Consider color coordinating early on if it matters to you. Wild Country Superlight Offset rocks are pretty much the best stoppers I’ve ever used and they weigh half as much as regulars.,May 2016,Apr 28 2020,3
8021,Thinking about my first rack,1,2, Thanks!  Very helpful indeed,Sep 2017,Apr 28 2020,0
8022,Thinking about my first rack,1,3, Yes~ I am saying that z4’s or similar would be better than .3~ .4~ .5~ and (even) the .75 C4’s. The wideness of C4’s in the smaller sizes prevents some placements and narrower cams help to fix that problem. ,May 2016,Apr 28 2020,6
8023,Thinking about my first rack,1,4, I think for the most part I am echoing Alex... I would start with a set of C4s or something that follows the same sizing (dragons or friends) and suppliment from there. C4s are sort of the standard~ so it will likely be easier to share or combine with friends gear. From there its basically all personal preference. I like C4s for size 0.75 and up. 0.5 and below I definitely like a narrower head with a bit more flexibility.  Cams on my typical double rack look something like: 2x(0.75-3 C4)~ 1x(#4 C4)~ 1x(blue - red totem basic)~ 1x(blue-red mastercams). If it looks thin or there are a lot of horizontals I will also rack up a set of C3s.,May 2018,Apr 28 2020,1
8024,Thinking about my first rack,1,5, It’s a matter of personal preference. They’re all fairly good quality wise. When you actually need to start buying a rack~ you’ll know exactly what you want. ,Sep 2005,Apr 28 2020,0
8025,Thinking about my first rack,1,6," So there's the ""big three~"" which are pretty much interchangeable and use the same color scheme: C4s: Most durable sling~ narrowest lobes~ anodized lobe surfaces grip a little less well. Most common cams (ultralights trade 25% of the weight for a less durable sling and a built-in expiry date). Friends: Widest lobes of the three~ lightest of the three (excluding ultralights)~ extendable slings which may kink the thumb loop~ sizes run slightly larger than C4s. Less commonly seen. Dragons: Sturdy~ good extendable slings~ no thumb loop~ heaviest of the three. Sizes run a hair smaller than C4s. For what it's worth I went with friends as my primary cams and I have no complaints. Would definitely recommend switching brands when you go to get doubles for the size overlap~ and Z4s for the .3-.75 sizes.",Apr 2019,May 1 2020,2
8026,Thinking about my first rack,1,7, I agree with everyone else on C4s for .75 and up~ and something different below that. I actually find myself wanting a smaller head width in my .75 cams for my local area~ so I prefer a totem/Z4 in that size as well. I recently built my ideal double rack out for a friend who wanted to buy a rack and it looked like this. IMO this is the best combination of gear for my local area~ and its something that I would feel comfortable traveling anywhere with. Keep in mind this is alot of gear and you don’t need to buy it all at once~ so buy what you can~ keep climbing with friends with  supplemental gear and add on as you go. C4 x2: 1-4 Z4 x1: .5~ .75 Totem x1: .5~ .75 Totem x2: black (.2)-yellow (.4) Mastercam or C3 up to .2,Oct 2017,May 5 2020,0
8027,Thinking about my first rack,1,8, Thoughts from a fellow Boston/New England climber: C4s are gold standard in mid to large sizes for a reason - stick with those. For smaller cams (below 0.75) I have a mix of mastercams and aliens~ and have recently added totems after seeing their sticking power on aid. Totems are specialty pieces imo and a newer trad climber would do better with bread and butter cams with a narrower head than small C4s. Mastercams~ Z or X4s~ and Aliens are perfect for this. I also have larger aliens (0.75~ 1 C4 size) since I find their narrow head great in the shallow placements that funky NH granite sometimes has.,Apr 2013,May 5 2020,1
8028,Thinking about my first rack,1,9, Thanks everyone! So then the questions I am still left with are: 1. How low do you go?  In my experience thus far~ I haven't placed many cams smaller than 0.3 or so~ but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be/don't need to get them 2. With the cams at the lower end of the C4 scale that are covered by others (e.g. 0.3~ 0.4~ and 0.5) is it better to go with C4s~ Z4s~ something else~ or a mix?,Sep 2017,May 5 2020,0
8029,Thinking about my first rack,1,10, 1.)This depends where and how hard you climb. Nuts will often work where you'd place a 0.2 or 0.1. I have down to a blue mastercam~ roughly a 0.2. Anything smaller is specialized equipment imo.,Oct 2017,May 5 2020,1
8030,Thinking about my first rack,1,11, 1. In general~ I try not to get stuff unless I can see an obvious need for it.  So~ if you haven't been finding places where you want something smaller than 0.3~ hold off on that.,Nov 2018,May 5 2020,2
8031,Thinking about my first rack,1,12, Agreed that below 0.2 is specialized - I overlap mastercams/aliens up to 0.75 and C4s down to 0.5 (one of each for a double rack).,Apr 2013,May 5 2020,0
8032,Thinking about my first rack,1,13, I would get: Z4's from .3 to .75 C4's from 1 to 3 Consider getting the black totem (sized between a .2 and a .3)  This keeps the sizes uniformly color coated. The narrower heads on the Z4's (or equivalent) means they fit in more placements. From size 1 and up this really doesn't matter much.  Fill in doubles (.75 & 1 first)~ microcams~ and tweener sizes over the next bunch of years as you find a need for them.  BD cams go on sale often.  ,Mar 2016,May 5 2020,1
8033,Thinking about my first rack,1,14, What~ you aren't going to buy a bunch of outdated U-stem Camalots and mix them up with a mishmash of booty cams? How else will you discover how little you like old Trango cams with the floppy stems? How else will you find out how terrible rigid Friends are? And how about that rack of Tricams you will be handed by a friend who hasn't used them in years? Or~ you can peruse the used gear at your local consignment store and pick up some hexes. Where's the fun in buying the best gear for your first rack?  OMG. You might actually enjoy your first lead with it.,Jan 2001,May 5 2020,3
8034,Thinking about my first rack,1,15, Small cams below 0.3 and micro offset nuts like Peenuts are an absolute necessity for me. Can make the difference in topping out or bailing. But you don’t use them much until you start pushing into the 12’s. ,Sep 2005,May 5 2020,1

8036,Thinking about my first rack,1,17, Thank you for this valuable addition to the discussion. ,Mar 2016,May 5 2020,2
8037,Thinking about my first rack,1,18, Honestly~ all of the cams mentioned in this thread are fine. I cant imagine you truly regretting your decision. Ill just add a voice of dissent regarding doubles. I hate climbing on racks that have mix and match gear. Just buy doubles of whatever cam you pick. I can count on one hand the times that i have had to run it out because i was missing the ONLY size cam that would fit in the area that I felt that i needed a piece of gear. The convenience of having all matching gear outweighs the benefits of having overlapping cam ranges in my opinion. ,Sep 2013,May 5 2020,1
8038,Thinking about my first rack,1,19, I disagree. We all have our opinions though. Just rack with the same color biner and problems solved.,Sep 2017,May 5 2020,1
8039,Thinking about my first rack,1,20, Just rack with the same color biner and problems solved. This is what I do with my C3's (C3's are all one color off. Yellow C3 is a double for my blue .3 C4~ Red C3 is actually a .2 and should be yellow~ etc). ,Mar 2016,May 5 2020,1
8040,Thinking about my first rack,2,0," Agree with a lot of the above. I've never liked C4s at BD size .5 or below~ too wide. When my friends try to put theirs on the rack I take them off and replace with Aliens~ TCUs~ Totems~ etc. .75 use to be the size I'd start with C4s. .75 aliens were too floppy~ TCUs walk too much. But now X4s or Totems may be a little better in that size. Small cams can be any of: aliens~ totems~ mastercams~ dragonflies~ Z4s~ etc.. #1 Personal preference. #2 Buy what's on sale / good value. TCUs are kinda obsolete with all the Alien inspired designs. I start with a .2 size for free climbing. As mentioned mix two brands for doubles because sometimes one fits better. There's some differences in size/range~ but I wouldn't say the other brands are 1/2 size different from BD. There's many charts online that compare ranges. Totems are a significantly different design than other cams. Like when Aliens first came out~ they are both very innovative. Totems apply the camming action through a cable directly attached to the cam lobes~ vs. through the axle like all other cams. So they are significantly better in flares (since each side can work independently). They are the most bulky~ and typically the most expensive~ so there's a trade off. They mostly match BD sizes and colors. The Black and Yellow Totems are different colors. I like how totems sizes are the ideal placement size (aka reference size) in inches (which is funny because they are a Spanish company and you'd think they'd use centimetres). e.g. a .5 black totem's ideal placement is a .5"" crack. A 1.5 red totem is for a 1.5"" hand crack (BD calls this a #1 Red).",Oct 2011,May 5 2020,2
8041,Thinking about my first rack,2,1, I posted similar advice in the last one of these threads as a half-joke~ but the more I think about it~ the more I think its actually an ok idea given some considerations: If you have consistent climbing partners with a double rack of their own~ buy BD 4 and up~ as big as you can afford. Having a quad rack from .3-3 is not especially helpful for most routes~ especially when you are first getting into trad climbing. It is nice later on for more specialty routes (i.e. Indian Creek~ Outer Limits~ etc) or big walls. Instead~  having big gear early on will get you tons more partners and open up a lot of routes~ even easy ones~ because you can actually protect the wide stuff where it would normally be a run out.  Just a consideration.  Also~ I do not know much about the trad in your neck of the woods~ so if OW is not as necessary as in places like Yosemite and Squamish~ ignore me. Maybe ignore me regardless. ,Jun 2015,May 5 2020,1
8042,Thinking about my first rack,2,2, There's lots of cam comparison charts online and in modern guidebooks~ but I put together this simple chart to keep track of the brands I use and what sizes approximately coincide.,Oct 2011,May 5 2020,0

8046,Thinking about my first rack,2,6, You can get matching cams with overlapping ranges (BD and WC).,Apr 2019,May 5 2020,0
8047,Thinking about my first rack,2,7, Not quite. There are placements where three cam lobes is actually a preference over the four lobes of an alien. An alien occasionally feels too wide for the smallest placements. So if doubling up on the tiny stuff~ I would suggest TCUs as a complement. I haven't played with the fancy Totems~ so maybe they have obsoleted the TCUs~ but according to the previous chart~ there's no Totem equivalent for the purple Metolius TCU. This is just a minor detail that shouldn't affect anyone's thinking about a first rack though~ but maybe keep it in mind for later additions. ,Jun 2010,May 5 2020,0
8048,Thinking about my first rack,2,8, I actually like this idea~ but it only works if you 1) live somewhere with a lot of offwidth and 2) like the idea of climbing offwidth and have friends who like it too. Not everyone's that type of masochist,Apr 2019,May 5 2020,1
8049,Thinking about my first rack,2,9, You can get matching cams with overlapping ranges (BD and WC). Thats a good point~ but arent they so close as to barely be overlapping?,Sep 2013,May 6 2020,0
8050,Thinking about my first rack,2,10, Thats a good point~ but arent they so close as to barely be overlapping? Nah~ the overlap is actually useful. Particularly at the #2 size~ but even down at the #.5 size I've had placements that were awkward with one but bomber with the other.,Apr 2019,May 6 2020,0
8051,Thinking about my first rack,2,11, Lots of wonderful cam-related insights on this thread.  If you're a New England trad climber don't overlook tricams.  There are many places (cough cough Whitehorse) where they are really the only thing that will work (think pockets on otherwise blank~ boltless slab) and I almost always get a tricam in on most leads.  Some people hate them but I~ for one~ find them indispensable for climbing trad in New England.  ,Mar 2019,May 6 2020,0

8053,Harness fitting tips in times of COVID,1,0, I need a new harness for the 2020 season- mine has seen a little too much wear and tear despite sitting in a closet for months.  The problem is~ every single harness I've tried on in the stores this year has been a nut-cruncher for me.  My old harness is a Petzl Corax and I loved it to death~ but the new Corax design is less beefy and more constricted where I don't want it to be.  I even ordered a Misty Mountain Cadillac~ but I messed up the leg loop sizing and had to sell it; also~ I'm not too thrilled with the gear loop designs. Has anyone used the Petzl Calidris harness or the BD Big Gun harness?  I mostly climb multipitch trad routes and I'm more concerned with comfortable fit than weight.  It's way more scary to take whippers if they all feel like a punch to the balls. In the interest of not wanting to shell out over $100 for another harness that doesn't fit~ and the inability to try anything on right now~ does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this problem?  Once the restrictions lift in the hazy and nebulous future~ I don't want to be stuck without something to climb in~ and shipping takes time so I'd like to be ready to go.,Feb 2010,May 5 2020,1
8054,Harness fitting tips in times of COVID,1,1, I'd suggest you list the harnesses on your list~ your waist size~ and your height~ then people could recommend a size that worked for them.

8056,Harness fitting tips in times of COVID,1,3," I have a 31"" waist and I'm 5'11"".  Medium size harnesses usually fit my waist well.  It's the leg loop designs that get me into trouble!  Adjustable leg loops are a must~ but the angles of most modern harnesses seem to be different from the older models and I think that's what causes my problem. Those Metolius harnesses look pretty nice.  My only concern there is the gear loops- similar to the Misty Mountain harnesses~ it looks like they are simple non-reinforced crescents that could cause cams to stack and tangle with a large rack.  With that said~ that's a relatively minor concern if the fit is good and the harness is comfortable to hang in.",Feb 2010,May 5 2020,0
8057,Harness fitting tips in times of COVID,1,4, I'd suggest trying the size small Waldo Speed Buckle version. Super comfortable~ and I have plenty of room to tighten down the waist more.

8062,Harness fitting tips in times of COVID,1,9," +1 for the pants being the crunching culprit.  It can be tough to get the right fit in pants for climbing.  A little more roomy fit than you might otherwise want may be the ticket. Ha-- many years ago one of the first ""performance"" clothing alterations I made was to sew a gusset into the crotch seam of a pair of nylon pants for use with a climbing harness.  As the gusset material was a lightweight nylon that was thinner and softer than the pants' original material and was sewn with an inward-facing center seam of its own~ it would mostly ""hide"" itself when I was walking around.  But then when harness leg loops were pulled up~ it would sort of unfold like butterfly wings and give me some extra space.  It looked even more ridiculous than it sounds.  Especially because the pants were blue and the added gusset was black.  I have a lot of classic ""butt shot"" photos from the early years with a black diamond patch staring the viewer straight in the eye from in between my leg loops.  But the darn thing worked better than just about every pair of high-end climbing pants I've owned since. Wow~ now I've descended into embarrassing oversharing.  This Covid lockdown situation can't end soon enough...",Jan 2006,May 5 2020,3

8068,Sum'tec Hybrid Ice Axe - How hybrid are we talking?,1,0," Hi all~ I've got a target this summer that may require some climbing on 45 degree ice in a couloir (N. Palisade~ U-Notch). I have two regular axes but I wanted to mix it up a bit by getting a tool for the ice. I've been on low angle ice before with my regular axe and was fine... but new gear is always fun. Anyways~ I'm only going to buy one for now because I don't have any plans for vertical ice. With all that said~ I was wondering if the Sum'tec would fit the bill for what I'm planning to use it for. Or should I just get a a proper tool? This guy appears to do alright at above what I'm looking at: Responses because over my limit: Thanks! I've got an 26"" Grivel Glacier and a comparable BD~ I think it's called a ""Raven?"" The BD axe is pretty heavy so I'm not opposed to ditching it in favor of a tool just to save some weight. But good to know that I'd probably be ok with what I have. That said~ a single Quark is looking good if I do go for a tool~ so thanks for the tip - price is right~ too. My friends all ice climb at Lee Vining so they'll probably drag me out there one day~ so vertical ice is not out of the question in the future. I mostly climb in California so real vertical ice opportunities are limited.",May 2020,May 3 2020,0
8069,Sum'tec Hybrid Ice Axe - How hybrid are we talking?,1,1, The Sum'tec will climb 45 degree ice much better than your traditional axes will.   Both the pick design and the fact that it has a pinky rest make it better at vertical ice.   However~ given that you already have 2 traditional axes~ maybe it makes more sense to get an axe like the quark or cobra?   Especially if you want to get into vertical ice climbing in the future. I guess what I'm saying is that I recommend the Sum'tec to two people 1.   The person getting their first axe who intends on quickly progressing from easy glacier objectives to moderate angle alpine objectives. 2.   Somebody who intends to have a big quiver of axes and wants a great tool for moderate angle alpine objectives,Mar 2008,May 3 2020,0
8070,Sum'tec Hybrid Ice Axe - How hybrid are we talking?,1,2, What are you regular axes and how long? For something like the U-Notch which is just ice no real bulgy steps over icy rock I would say just save yer money til you figure out what you might be doing in the future.,Jul 2007,May 3 2020,0
8071,Sum'tec Hybrid Ice Axe - How hybrid are we talking?,1,3, Would person 1 not be better served getting a more traditional (and significantly less expensive) piolet like the BD Raven or DMM Cirque to start out with~ and then paired technical tools (quarks~ cobras~ etc.) when needed? Or just going straight for a single quark or cobra and bypassing the walking tool entirely?,Apr 2019,May 3 2020,1
8072,Sum'tec Hybrid Ice Axe - How hybrid are we talking?,1,4, If you didn’t own the sum tec~ but had say~ a quark/cobra/viper~ then I would say skip it. If you have none of those~ the sum tec would be great. On 45* ice~ good foot technique and one sum tec should be great. ,Jan 2020,May 4 2020,0

8076,Sum'tec Hybrid Ice Axe - How hybrid are we talking?,1,8, Yeah~ they're the older ones.

8083,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,0, Looking to get my first down bag~ tossing up between the WM Alpinlite and the FF Swallow UL 20. The major differences (other than a bit of extra chest room that I don't really need) are the weight and the draft collar. I've never used a bag with a draft collar so...are they worth it? I'm a fairly restless side-sleeper~ so I find that features designed to increase warmth for non-spastics often end up in the wrong place for me by 2 AM. These any different?,Apr 2019,May 1 2020,0
8084,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,1, They are a big deal for me. I am a side sleeper also~ and I find that when I flail around in the night~ the draft collar keeps things sealed up nicely. In a bag without the collar~ when you accidentally break the face-hole seal you lose a ton of heat from the entire bag. ,Oct 2017,May 1 2020,15
8085,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,2, Not for me~ I'm usually scrunched down into the bag if it's butt-assed cold. Draft Collar does nothing for me. Those are both top notch companies that make excellent product.  ,Mar 2006,May 1 2020,1
8086,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,3, On the one or two occasions that I've been in my bag when temperatures approached the bag's comfort limit~ I was awfully glad to have the draft collar.

If the weight /price/pack size are similar get the warmer bag~ much more difficult to get warm when you're approaching limits out there than to dump some heat. For reference I use a -5F RAB bag for all-purpose winter camping. Just slept out in Indian Peaks on a ski-backpacking trip last week with overnight temps at ~+15F and it was perfect.

I also have a northface 20 degree synthetic allution bag.  The draft coller makes a huge difference in sub freezing conditions. The northface bag is a little small short. The big agnes bag is huge. The insulation of a down bag is a pain in the ass peroid. I can throw my north face bag into the wash and dry in less than two hours.

8100,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,17, For what its worth~ my draft collar (the built in cinch cord type) makes a massive difference for me if it's super cold conditions. It can be the difference between shivering all night or sleeping like a baby. I pair it with a down balaclava if I'm sleeping in some ridiculous temps for maximum air retainage in my bag. You don't want any air leaking out of the bag once it gets warm. You should be able to fart and not be able to smell it all night Wearing down booties (or wool socks~ or both) in your bag is also super useful if it's really cold out. I use a feathered friends Tanager 20 - ridiculously lightweight for how toasty it is. I've felt comfortable in 10 degree temps in that thing with the down booties and down balaclava (in addition to my normal climbing base layers and puffies). Its hard to be upset with spending extra on a good sleeping setup. It is an investment that pays off within a single season imo.,Mar 2014,May 1 2020,4

8102,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,19, I've used both sleeping bags with and without draft collars. In my opinion~ the draft collar is always warmer and I feel like I sleep better. One issue I had with my old~ non-draft-collar bag is that I would toss and turn a bunch and end up curling myself into a ball while sleeping. The draft collar keeps my head out from inside my sleeping bag and I feel like I can actually get warm.  So I would ask yourself: Do you sleep cold? Would you be willing to take up more weight to be warmer?,Dec 2018,May 1 2020,0
8103,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,1,20, I've tested several bags from Western Mountaineering and Feathered Friends for OutdoorGearLab~ including the Swallow YF and the slimmer cousin of the Alplinite~ the Ultralite. Both are awesome bags. As you've noticed~ the biggest difference is the draft collar. Personally I prefer a draft collar in a bag with this level of insulation because I believe it extends the usable temperature down considerably. In my experience Feather Friends down feels slightly loftier~ but the draft collar on the Alpinite should result in it being the overall warmer bag.  If you do go with a Feathered Friends bag~ be aware that the UL fabric makes a crinkly sound that the YF fabric does not. If your restless-ness is influenced by noise~ the heavier YF fabric is a better choice. However~ I would caution you from choosing either the Swallow or the Alpinlite if it's going to be your primary sleeping bag. They're simply too warm for most applications. But if you have especially cold objectives in mind~ they're both a great choice.,Nov 2009,May 1 2020,1
8104,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,2,0, I really like a bag that seals around my neck~ I'd rather that than a hood~ I find unless done up completely a hood doesn't provide any real seal and just dump out heat and even then the seal isn't anywhere near as good as having a dedicated active draft collar.,Oct 2015,May 2 2020,0
8105,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,2,1, That's probably one from the Widgeon series. We got two mating Widgeons with custom black~ LW~ ripstop~ non-waterproof nylon (standard was Gtex shell) as wedding presents over 30 yrs ago and they have been our only sleeping bags for all seasons ever since. They've only lost a little bit of loft over all that time and look set to keep going for quite a few more years. Combined with the removable collar~ they have continuous trapezoidal baffles (weight/down-holding compromise between V-shaped and square-box baffles). These allow shifting/shaking the down almost completely between top and bottom and keeping it in place overnight~ which expands the temperature range enormously. We've slept comfortable from -20C (-5F) to +15C (+60F)~ which is why we've never needed to buy another bag. They get sweaty above that but by then you can just sleep with the bag open. Of course~ in warmer temperatures~ that means that you're carrying extra down only to flatten it under you but the upside of that is that you can take them just about anywhere~ anytime~ and know that whatever the weather throws at you~ you're going to sleep warm. With our oldest daughter~ we went cheaper with a collar-less bag with continuous square baffles from Taiga. What a mistake. They claimed that the extra-overstuffed neck baffles plus generally overstuffed bag were functionally equivalent to a collar but they are definitely not. And the square baffles don't hold the down in place so the bag can only be used for winter~ except for the lack of a collar. I made a removable collar myself using a bunch of down from the bag but~ since the bag gets sweaty around 0C (+32F)~ there's hardly ever any need to remove it. By the time we were ready to buy an adult bag for our youngest~ we really wanted her to have the same design as us but FF was no longer making anything like the original Widgeons. We also realized that Integral Designs had adopted the original Widgeon model for a time but had also recently stopped making them~ concentrating instead on tactical gear. A store in Vancouver claimed to still carry them. Turns out they didn't have any in stock but the guy assured us that he could get us one and delivered on that. When it arrived~ it was basically identical to our original Widgeons with a few minor improvements and~ even cooler~ it came with Integral Tactical logos ! Regarding the need for a collar in cold temperatures~ it's pretty clear that I'm with the majority that thinks it's essential. Regarding the option of tucking your head inside the bag~ remember that this means that a large amount of moisture from your breath will condensate in the middle of the down insulation~ collapsing it. Tolerating a cold nose and lips while keeping the warmth sealed-in by the collar means having only a part of the breath moisture condensate on the surface of the shell~ with the rest freezing on the tent walls.,Apr 2012,May 2 2020,0
8106,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,2,2," You definitely want a draft collar for temperatures in that range~ especially if you move around a lot and or are pushing the limits of the bag. Without one~ every time you reposition you are going to exchange warm air from your bag with cold outside air~ with one you'll only exchange air from the much smaller pocket of air in the hood. You'lll dump a lot of heat this way over the course of the night if you are a restless sleeper. If you are trying to be super weight conscious you can use a mid layer wrapped around your neck to help seal a bag with no collar~ but it""s not nearly as effective or comfortable as a purpose built collar.",Jun 2016,May 2 2020,0

The intent for this bag is three-season alpine use in the US (Wind Rivers~ High Sierras~ Cascades) and New Zealand~ and winter use in Australia and Tasmania.  Sorry~ my previous comment wasn't very clear. I think the Swallow and Alpinlite are too warm for 3-season use in the States. In other words~ they have too much insulation.   Last year I climbed a lot in the Sierra and Winds. My favorite bag for a 1-2 night trip is a FF Flicker or Vireo. For longer trips or colder nights in spring and fall~ my go to is a FF Hummingbird UL. Note that all of these bags have a 30F temp rating or higher.  If I could only have one bag for 3-season alpine climbing~ it would be a Hummingbird UL. However~ this is a narrow bag and I'm a skinny guy. My  recommendation for the general public is the WM MegaLite. It's a little heavier but I think most people will appreciate the wider dimensions over the full lifetime of a bag.,Nov 2009,May 2 2020,3
8111,How big of a deal are draft collars in sleeping bags?,2,7," I've had a WM Megalite for about 2 years~ and it's been fantastic for summer trips to the sierras and winter high desert stuff. The quality is incredible. I have a long~ and the zipper goes to about 6"" from the end. The zipper on my girlfriend's regular length goes pretty much all the way to the end. I originally wanted the Alpinlite but after seeing one in person i decided it was too much for my fair weather southwestern pursuits and got the megalite. The large cut of the megalite makes it kind of drafty~ and with only the top half of a draft collar i find myself using my puffy jacket as a draft collar most nights. I'm super into it though and don't mind having to use some of my other layers to dial in the temperature of the sleep system and having space to change pants while zipped in is sweet.",May 2018,May 3 2020,0

8120,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,0, Hi everyone~ I have been climbing on and off for years and now worked my way up to leading~ mostly sport and some mix sport/trad.  I have a concern about back-clipping.  Other than not doing it~ would a locking carabiner such as the Black Diamond Magantron (rope side) with a wire gate (rock side) be sufficient to prevent a back clip accident? Does anyone make such a package? Thank you~Ben ,Mar 2018,May 4 2020,0
8121,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,1, it would prevent it~  but now you have to mess with a locker every time you want to clip the rope? I guess when you’re fumbling with the locker you have some extra time to figure out if you’re clipping the right way. ,Feb 2020,May 4 2020,22
8122,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,2, In case you aren't Tradiban's new account and this isn't just a troll... Yeah it would work in theory~ no they don't sell them~ definitely learn not to back clip.,Dec 2016,May 4 2020,17
8123,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,3, Well~ thats an expensive and heavy solution to a manageable problem~ but yes it would likely prevent an unclipping accident. The magnetron would be a good choice given the less likelyhood that it would abrase the rope relative to a normal locker~ though it would probably be impossible to clip one handed. You would also get more drag from your back clips on your rope. Its probably just easier to learn how to clip correctly.,Oct 2014,May 4 2020,4

8126,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,6, Oh. Yes~ don't back clip.  If you are worried about your gear somehow unclipping from a carabiner - like you're about to launch off into the crux and need to make sure the gear below is not going to do some weird once in a million thing~ using a locking biner rather than a regular carabiner isn't totally weird. I recall the accident on Mickey Mouse Wall in Eldo where a carabiner may have unclipped itself because of gate flutter.  But this would be a truly unique situation when just sport climbing~ I would assume. Many different things would have to go sensationally wrong.,Jan 2014,May 4 2020,0
8127,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,7, This (or some other lightweight locker).,Jul 2008,May 4 2020,2
8128,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,8," Some sport climbers carry an occasional locking biner quickdraw on certain routes where a particular clip is going to be subject to weird pulls and/or where failure of that particular protection point would be catastrophic. It can add to your peace of mind~ but it can also add extra fuss that is most often unnecessary. Regardless~ of all the ways to create a locking quickdraw~ a Magnetron seems like a cumbersome and difficult choice to me.  I think the opening mechanism on those would be too fiddly to perform one-handed while hanging in an awkward spot~ for example.  Actually~ it would probably be very difficult in most situations to loop the rope through a hanging Magnetron while keeping the gate open after pinching the opening mechanism.   If you really want to~ there are a bunch of auto-lock mechanisms that are easier to operate one handed (e.g. Edelrid)~ but I've used one of those Grivel biners with the two wire gates.  It's just doable to push the outward-facing wiregate open with the rope that you've brought up to clip or even sort of split the two wiregates open with a stab of the thumb~ and then it slips into the basket past the inward-facing wiregate easily.  The rope is then effectively running through a locking biner.  I have only one draw set up this way~ and in reality I've only felt the desire to carry and place it on maybe two routes in the last five years.  For trad climbing~ you're likely carrying a few lockers anyway~ so you could in theory build a runner with a locker. Finally~ keep in mind that even a quickdraw with locking biners could receive some weird twisting if back clipped and might make for a wonky fall.  Even if your rope-end biner was a locker~ your bolt-end biner could get twisted or flipped relative to the hanger~ too.  I wouldn't rely on a particular biner set up to prevent a back clipping accident.  For that~ you should just rely on clipping correctly.  Every time. Man~ I'm gonna feel dumb if I'm being trolled right now.  But whatever~ something to do at home at night... Edit:  Ben says he's a real live person looking for helpful advice.  In that case~ happy climbing... ... and one other thought:  on sport climbs~ do you occasionally (as I do) carry a set of locking-biner runners to put on the anchor for the rest of your posse to TR through (thus saving wear on your ""real"" quickdraws and adding a measure of insurance to the clips on your anchor)?  If so~ you'll already be carrying a locking biner quickdraw if you felt the need to place one mid-route.",Jan 2006,May 4 2020,1
8129,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,9, Locking biner will greately decrease the chance of rope unclipping in backclip scenario~ but it is not practical in most cases~ because it is heavier~ harder to clip~ and you will have to fumble with the locking mechanism. ,Mar 2011,May 5 2020,0
8130,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,10, As stated above~ careful with lockers on QD’s... nothing worse than going to clip a bolt and you need to unscrew the locker just a tad because it tightened while you were climbing. Just don’t back clip. Make sure the rope is always falling down from the QD like a waterfall.. that’s how it was explained to me years ago..  Lead climb enough and your eyes will kinda train themselves to look for it. It just looks wrong. Your belayer should be on the look out for back clipping!!!!,Sep 2015,May 5 2020,0

8132,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,12, The best explanation I was given to keep from back clipping is to imagine the rope as a stream of piss. Calvin and Hobbes style. If you peed through the carabiner from your position it would go up~ through the carabiner~ and then to the wall and down.  If it looks like your pee is going to the wall and then up through the carabiner then you're back clipped.

8135,Locking quickdraws? Back clipping,1,15, I call a locker- locker draw a Jesus Draw. Best used where you never ever could survive a unclip. Like the 3rd bolt~ where your stomach or feet will be pushing and turning the draw over.  And I use a Megaton for my belay device~ but I find it doesn’t work to well for other uses~ it’s hard to pinch it when clipped to a bolt. ,Mar 2008,May 5 2020,0

8147,Is Shock loading a myth?,1,7, Uhhh~ the video doesn’t look at shock loading at all. All they did was measure peak impact force at several points of interest. They missed the time over which that force was applied.... You need to look at force vs. time to really understand what could be considered a shock load.

8149,Is Shock loading a myth?,1,9, The force required to arrest a fall~ to first order~ is 9.8*M*L/D newtons~ where M is the mass of the climber in kilograms~ L is the length of the fall and D is the length of stretch in your rope/sling/body~ both in meters. To higher order~ the peak force is the maximum of some function that needs to integrate over the length of the arrest to the total work done by the fall~ 9.8*M*L. This function will in reality be roughly constant - the force will be spread out evenly during the duration of the arrest~ assuming the rope and person behave as springs~ which they mostly do.,Nov 2017,Apr 28 2020,6
8150,Is Shock loading a myth?,1,10," The maximum force is all that is relevant in this case. The speed at which a force is applied IS important to materials scientists and engineers and is called the rate of strain~ the strength of materials varies with the rate of strain. Some get stronger as the strain rate increases~ some weaker and some do both~ there are curves available for most materials. Because polymers usually flow they usually get ""stronger"" the faster the force is applied and this is the case for nylon 6.6. We are talking about milliseconds though so nothing of interest to us~ the researchers stop measuring at rates of over 5000/s.",Nov 2009,Apr 29 2020,26
8151,Is Shock loading a myth?,1,11," Interesting Video. Quite a while ago we did some tests for the german alpine club simulating a factor 2 fall with a tire + sand for weight into a sliding X with a failing point (used a 3 mm cord with a single fishermans knot which breaks rather easy).. In our experiments we did measure a quite high peak force due to shock loading. Also more recently the austrian mountain guides did some tests with runners as lanyards and showed~ that even ""small"" static falls into those runners (with and without knots) could generate enogh force to break them (youtube.com/watch?v=qXN4uxI… ).. IMO this shows that shock loading is a problem we need to be aware of. And if you think about it: the anchor will most likely not fail while you just sit on it~ so to be really realistic you would need to to whip onto the belay to find out..",Apr 2014,Apr 29 2020,3
8152,Is Shock loading a myth?,1,12, Even more exciting is when the lead climbet takes a FF2  straight onto the belayer and then the belay fails~ the combined effect of the belay force on the leader and the increased force on the belayer as they are accelerated downwards breaks everything. I've done hundreds of drop tests on all the possibilities with sliding anchor systems and there are plenty of interesting scenarios to explore. The sliding X is junk.,Nov 2009,Apr 29 2020,12

8169,Is Shock loading a myth?,2,8, Lol seriously its great that you remember a definition~ but it's clear you don't understand what's going on here. What's important to study is in fact the maximum force during a shock load situation. Impulse doesn't break things~ force does (or more specifically~ pressure). So what's happening during a shock load situation is that you have an object with momentum (falling human body) that is shock loaded (impulse happens in a short amount of time) leading to a higher force. Impulse = F*T~ small T means large F. It is true that if you calculate the impulse and measure time you could calculate the maximum force on the anchor~ but you could also just measure the force - there's no need to measure both. i've addressed all your concerns in my previous posts. i've agreed to several of your points already AND linked to an article that reviews impulses to the human body and possible injuries. ,Dec 2014,Apr 29 2020,0

8172,Is Shock loading a myth?,2,11," That is a good text (it came up during my search too).  However~ I didn't see anywhere in it that specifically defined ""shock load"" as an impulse (force-time units).  I very well could have missed it though~ is there a particular section that clarifies that? Note that figure 21.2 illustrates my misgivings about trying to call a shock load specifically as an impulse value.  They show 2 different scenarios with the same kinetic energy absorbed~ but the peak force differs greatly due to the deflection of the beam spreading out the force application over time.  If we call shock load the area under the curve~ as you suggest~ these two scenarios would have the same ""shock load""~ which seems like the exact opposite of what we want; we want to identify the fact that the peak force (and rate of force application/removal~ which is the really important too) is significantly higher for case 2.  Depending on an impulse number to indicate this will not work~ you need to look at peak force and application time~ as distinct entities. To be clear~ I am not disputing that the time component isn't relevant; it's super important~ because if the time is very long and the load application is very gradual~ it's not ""shock loading"" at all.  What I am disputing is the specific allegation that shock loading is defined as impulse and not as force.  I would suggest that ""shock load(ing)"" doesn't have a strict numerical/unit definition at all~ and simply refers to a situation where load gets applied and/or removed quickly~ and therefore creates a bunch of other considerations (energy absorption~ strain rate sensitivity~ vibration~ etc.).  The definition at the bottom of that paper seems to agree:",Mar 2015,Apr 29 2020,2

8189,Is Shock loading a myth?,3,8, In the video~ I think they said the sampling rate was 500 Hz. We don't know what the filtering is but it would be usual to low pass filter to 500 Hz or something less. Roughly~ If I was designing the instrument~ I would try to low pass filter at something like 250 Hz. To detect a signal you need to digitally sample at twice the frequency of the signal so sampling at 500 Hz will detect if there is a 250 Hz signal but can't give you the magnitude. To identify that signal you would need to sample over some time window and look for it in the frequency domain by doing a FFT. However~ to have some idea of the magnitude~ you need to sample at least 10x the frequency so the instrument should be able to measure the magnitude of a 50 Hz signal or the peak for everything up to 50 Hz combined. Again~ if you wanted to look for just the 50 Hz signal~ you would need a time history. The natural frequency of the human body is in the 5 to 10 Hz range depending on posture~ size~ ect. So with a 500 Hz sample rate and a 10 Hz natural frequency~ they have a good chance of getting a good approximation of the peak. Digital sampling never captures the absolute peak but the error is probably negligible. The 22 kN generally required for climbing anchors has nothing to do with the forces a falling climber can generate but with the survivable force a climber can endure. As mentioned earlier~ this is in the 12+ g range. 80 kg person at 13 g is (80*9.8*13) about 10 kN. For an anchor~ you need to double this rope force. I don't think it is possible for a climber to generate a 10 kN force on the rope in any reasonable configuration. I think the tests in the video generally agree with this opinion. If I followed the video right~ they got a maximum of about (2.4/0.8) 3 g's. Much less than the 13 g's used for climbing gear design. In the video~ they mentioned survived rocket sled tests of 46 g's. This is front to back with a fully supported body. In the vertical~ 46 g's would collapse your spine and probably scramble your soft tissue innards. Ejection seats produce 13 g's but usually cause spinal compression injuries.,Mar 2014,May 2 2020,2
8190,Is Shock loading a myth?,3,9, The hassle is a lot of the the strain guages made for weighing/lifting applications may have quite high sampling rates but the signal is reduced to a speed that the display can cope with and that´s the digitally recorded peak~ for one I have it´s every 10secs refreshed so easy to miss the peak in short duration events .

8192,Is Shock loading a myth?,3,11, Actually Nyquist says you can also get amplitude~ in addition to frequency and phase~  by sampling by more than twice the signal frequency.  Your 10X sample rate makes seeing the signal on an oscilloscope easy. Nyquist is right. Sampling at twice the frequency of a continuous signal can identify the frequency and amplitude of the signal so long as you deal with the possibility of aliasing. The signal has to last long enough (be continuous) and you have to take enough samples to run an accurate FFT. In the drop test~ the signal is a damped pulse rather than a continuous signal and without oversampling~ you are very likely to miss the peak with 2x sampling. Whenever you need accurate waveform reproduction your only recourse is to oversample at a rate beyond Nyquist's 2 times minimum~ typically 10 times or more. ,Mar 2014,May 3 2020,0

Once you have the frequency one could fairly easily generate a sampled with a higher sample rate sine wave that passes though the original sample points and then compute the max value of the points to get the peak load.  All this assumes the load is a sine wave which I think is very likely.  ,Feb 2006,May 4 2020,0

Nyquist doesn't really havre much to do with single transient events. Nyquist ascerts that you can capture frequency and amplitude by sampling at twice the frequency of interest~ but that's really for repeating (continuous) signals. Transient spikes tend to contain very high frequency content~ and to capture true peaks in a transient~ you need to sample at a much higher rate. For some laboratory failure analysis (e.g. tensile testing)~ it might not be a big deal~ since the load is applied gradually (low frequency content). But for a rapidly applied load~ sample rate matters.,Jul 2016,May 4 2020,0

8197,Is Shock loading a myth?,3,16, the required sampling rate is going to depend on what you are testing.  in some cases 500hz will be overkill and in other cases it would be underkill.  for a situation like this~ where they probably don't really know what they need~ it helps to do multiple tests of the same situation but at different sampling rates to see what type of attenuation you are getting.,Dec 2004,May 5 2020,1
8198,North Face fit and product line ??,1,0," I've never owned a NF article before. Now I've got a pretty solid one time discount I'd feel foolish not to use. What to buy?  -Softshell~ My Moonstone softshell has to be at least 15 years old and doesn't stretch hardly at all. It's pretty much dead. That seems like a good option but I don't ice climb anymore and probably won't. The models they have seem more like fashionable tech sweater to wear around the crag or on the way to the gym. They don't look suited for the Designator on a drippy day. Maybe I'm wrong though. -Down Seems like a good idea. I only have a dirt cheap Eddie Bauer one now and the zipper is having issues. Are these good quality? They look like they have two products~ one to look ""outdoorsy retro"" in downtown Seattle in the fall and another to climb 8000 meter peaks. Seems like I'm in between. -Rain I have a pocket size windbreaker with a coating. Nothing else but it doesn't rain much or very long in CO~ so whatever. -Something else Do they have something in their product line that absolutely bitchin? Something that I'd regret not buying at 50% off? And sorry~ I don't have the time or energy to buy something and attempt to sell it at a profit~ so whatever it is~ I'm probably going to wear it until it goes out of style~ then back again.

8202,North Face fit and product line ??,1,4, I am 5’7” and 140lbs with a -2” ape index. I wear a small in TNF gear~ definitely find that their Summit and Flight Series product fits me better than the non-series items.  For gear~ I absolutely love my L3 Ventrix Hoody and Futurelight Dryzzle. They are warm enough to layer for resort skiing and breathable enough that I can wear them while touring and have been trail running in both. The Dryzzle is less of a specialty piece~ but the boxy fit makes it easy to layer under. It has essentially replaced my 10 year old Goretex Proshell as the jacket of choice.  The L3 Ventrix Hoody goes everywhere with me and seems very similar to the Patagonia Nano-Air.  The L2 Power Grid Hoody is similar to the Patagonia R1~ a nice layering piece if you don’t have a mid weight fleece.  The L3 Down Hoody is really solid~ but not a belay parka if you are looking for a really cold weather piece.  The AMK stuff is incredible and definitely on the cutting edge. It is also likely overkill for most of us~ but if you need the best it might be worth waiting for.  For transparency~ I work for TNF~ so I get to see a lot of this stuff up front~ but I’m not involved in product development or sales. ,Dec 2009,May 5 2020,0

8221,Heel slippage - Intuition liners in an Arc'teryx Acrux AR?,1,3, I have a lot of days in the Acrux AR and one thing that I have found is that I always have to readjust my lacing on these.    I can't seem to get them tight enough when they are cold in the tent.   So I put them on and redo the lacing and strap after they warm up.   Have you been doing that?,Mar 2008,Apr 30 2020,0

8227,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,0," I'm looking into Petzl Bug for Multipitch and possibly around the town/during travel. Looks like it's the most comfortable bag for Multipitch (and rope can be attached to it from above pretty well!) but it didn't get high scores in comparison with other bags in other aspects. Several reviews online rave about it nonetheless. So here's my question to you if you own and use this bag for Multipitch: would you buy it all over again~ or would you buy something else (if money wasn't an issue)? Perhaps you can also compare it to your friend's Multipitch bag: any pros/cons... Oh and if it makes any difference~ I'm female and 5'10"". Happy Thanksgiving to everyone~ by the way!",Nov 2018,Nov 22 2018,0
8228,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,1, Have an older Bug. Love it. Very durable and comfortable~ and climbing it’s easy to forget it’s on your back. Recently also bought a BD bullet (I think it’s called the bullet) and I’d buy another Bug over another bullet if I needed another. My Bug has a small hole in the bottom from hiking out an awesome rock the size of a football with fossils on it about 6 years ago but surprisingly the hole hasn’t grown at all since then. The other way the Bug is better then the bullet is the multiple clip loops on the back~ if the new ones still have those. ,May 2007,Nov 22 2018,1

8230,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,3, It is a great multi-pitch pack.  Fits comfortably~ has a rope strap down~ many outside gear loops~ and just big enough to carry H20/Emergency gear/Shoes w/o being too big.  Try a designated crag store.  South of you~ Nomads at J Tree is where I bought mine.  ,Jul 2009,Nov 22 2018,1
8231,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,4, Outdoorgearlab give it a tepid review.  The older model has worked fine for me as climbing pack;  a touch heavy by modern standards~ but better padded.  I like the stowable waist belt; OGL complains it should be removeable (so you can lose it or forget it).  I especially like the Bug for travel and around town because of its rectangular shape~ which accomdates file folders and computers much better than the more sculpted forms of most packs.  For travel~ the topo pocket on the back is perfect for maps ~ passports~ and brochures and other things you want to get at quickly without rummaging through the pack.,Feb 2008,Nov 22 2018,4
8232,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,5, I have a Bug and the BD Bullet.  Bug is way more versatile as it can be used to carry gear and ropes on the approach for climbs that go up and over~ while the Bullet is far more limited in what it can carry with no rope straps and no clip in points. I use the Bug for these types of climbs. I think the Bullet is more durable and is slightly smaller on the climb~ so I use it when I am taking a larger pack on the approach and just want a pack to take on route.  I also have a CAMP Phantom 2.0 that I like.  If I had to choose only one to buy~ it would be a Bug. ,May 2014,Nov 22 2018,0
8233,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,6, The Bug is pretty great. I agree with others above that it is better than the BD Bullet. My wife climbs with a DMM Zenith~ which is a nice bag~ but I find the zippers a bit flimsy~ the interior zip pocket ill-positioned~ and the opening shape fairly inconvenient. It has helmet carry and side gear loops though~ which the Bug lacks. Another great option is the Blue Ice Squirrel 22~ which has helmet carry and rope carry. It also has a nice hydration hanger~ which is missing from the Bug.,Jul 2015,Nov 22 2018,0
8234,Petzl Bug for Multipitch - if you own it~ please comment,1,7, I adore my bug for multi-pitch.  It’s lightweight~ comfortable~ fits perfectly above my harness~ and doesn’t interfere in the slightest with my climbing. There’s enough room for a reasonably-sized water bladder~ snacks~ a few pieces of gear~ and any clothes I need to shed along the way. The compression straps are useful either for extra rope or — my favorite use — to strap my approach shoes to the sides of the bag (as opposed to having them hang off the back from a biner). I couldn’t recommend the bug more highly.,Jan 2018,Nov 22 2018,1

8248,Building a wall and looking for suggestions,1,1," With a wall that size I wouldn't have a 4ft vertical space at the bottom~ your going to end up doing a bunch of weird crunchy moves low and it will feel like wasted space.  I would put a 1ft kicker at the bottom and a 1 ft finish jug strip at the top instead of 2ft and make the rest of the wall just 1 angle~ probably somewhere between 25 and 45 degrees depending on your preferences.  Then build volumes out of plywood to screw to your wall to change the angles and create some variety. This is a much more modular approach and allows you to use the wall more effectively than permanently building in angle changes.  It'll also make building it easier as you'll just be building a 1 angle wall with kickers at the bottom and top.  I worked at a gym with a lot of sharp angle changes like you have shown for many years~ and over time we found that we ended up setting similar movement in those areas because its just what worked the best for the angle and the transitions. I now work at a gym with more sweeping wall angles and its much better overall for setting and creativity~ especially when you add in volumes.  p.s we typically frame climbing walls with 2x6 and use 3/4"" tongue and groove plywood for sheathing",Nov 2006,May 4 2020,2

8267,Best big wall harness?,1,17, I used a custom Misty Mountain Cadillac (two belay loops~ extra gear loop on the back) on The Nose and found it very comfortable.

8273,Best big wall harness?,2,2, I tried on arcteryx~ misty mountain~ big gun~ and more~ I was surprised how uncomfortable they all were despite the rave reviews. Misty is still just a band of 1 inch webbing - it might be made in USA but that’s outdated tech. I bought this Edelrid (I actually got the Cyrus -no leg adjustment) and just can’t believe it; lightweight~ breathable~ comfortable. Hold it in your hand and you will understand - they drilled out holes in this stiff and light foam for breath ability~ and there are 5 micro webbings across the belt and legs~ not just one large piece of webbing. Hanging belays are dreamy~ I even like using it for trad/sport. Edelrid doesn’t get enough respect. ,Mar 2017,Apr 30 2020,2
8274,Best big wall harness?,2,3, Thanks for the feedback Levi. I gotta be honest~ even though I am super new to climbing~ I have been impressed with everything that Edelrid makes. I have bought quite a few of their lockers with the steel inserts to prevent rope/carabiner wear and tear~ and they are bomber~ yet still super light. I have the Ohm~ its a great piece of gear that really has helped equalize the forces in leader falls when my wife is on belay. I also bought their 9.6 Dry Pro rope~ have not had a chance to use it being that I am a responsible human and am staying home. Everything I have tried~ I have been impressed with.

8321,Homemade ice axe,2,6, Nate:   For what they are worth here are my thoughts:   The metal shafts look very hard to hang on to~ studying grip options will be key on those.  I am more interested in the wood handled ones.  Note that many modern tools have some curve to the shaft to avoid bouncing the shaft of the tool off a bulge~ can keep you upper knuckles from bruising as well.  The hooks at the bottom imply you would use them without leashes which I think is worth aspiring to. I love going leashless even though I can't climb as hard without them~ it just feels less encumbered. The connection at the top of the wood shaft is going to be a weak link~ you don't want that to be wobbly.  Try flaring the wood shaft out at the top and putting the two mounting bolts farther apart giving them a bit more leverage on the moment connection to the pick.   Someone above mentioned reverse curve picks. These have taken over as much for their ease of removal as their stickiness on placement.  It burns energy if you have to struggle to get your tool out of the ice before the next placement.  The picks also look pretty short; a lot of ice is more featured and you won't be able to get a good stuck with such short picks.   Fun looking project!  Do me a favor and test these on top rope only~ it really blows to break a tool on lead.,Nov 2001,Sep 15 2013,0

After you tweak the bends like BPD sez~ see if you can ""oval"" the shafts a bit by covering with a thick piece of plywood and then backing the car over a few times or using a sledge.  If you have access to a press then use that of course.    They'll feel better in the hand and you'll swing better. Then dip them in Plasti-dip or something like that.

8339,Homemade ice axe,3,4,,Feb 2010,Sep 21 2013,0
8340,Homemade ice axe,3,5, I would like to add a couple suggestions of how I would do it.   I would find a way to incorporate a readily available pick that is already on the market. Rather than that strange kung-fu weapon looking blade~ you can have a real pick that will really climb. Charlet/Petzl would be my gut feeling as to the best company to do this with but I can't justify why. Look at designs and see what you like.   On the same line of thinking~ it's probably also worth modding a head that accepts the picks. Make it somewhat modular too~ so you can reuse the basic design.   You have loads of room for your own creativity but it's worth looking at existing tools. Maybe even go into a shop with a large piece of paper and trace a tool. You don't need to or want to copy them~ the basic orientation of pick angle to handle position is worth looking at. More mixed tools will have a steeper angle while more pure ice or mountain/easy ice tools will be much closer to 90 degrees.   Now on to materials.   Can you get rid of the steel pipe? I don't know what tools you have at your shop but bent steel pipe kinda sucks. Every good tool I've ever swung has a light handle and all the weight in the head. You don't want a tank for a handle.   Personally~ I would work with drilled out spring steel (like monsters but lightened up) and wrap it in kevlar or bubblegum. I might use certain types of aluminum and also wrap it with something. I like Kevlar but fiberglass and carbon fiber are cool too. If I built my own~ they would be extremely curved futuristic looking things made of laminated hardwood and would never get used. I'm guessing you're looking more for function.   Do you have blocks of styrofoam or modelling clay for making mock ups?   Have you spent much time climbing ice to see what designs put a bigger smile on your face?   It's a good start. I just think you should embrace modern style in your design.   FWIW~ my tools were made in a garage.,Oct 2012,Sep 21 2013,1

8346,Homemade ice axe,3,11, This is an ice hammer I made around 1978. I had a Chouinard ice axe but hammers werent available so I forged~ hand filed and polished this one out of mild steel with help from my dad~ Vern Twombly. His hand made ice axe (circa 1938) was donated to the American Alpine Club museum in Golden. Great Pacific Iron Works installed a laminated bamboo shaft they were using on Chouinard axes at the time. The hammer face was too small and curved~ but the pick design worked really well~ even on waterfall ice. Shortly after I made it curved picks were obsolete for water ice but this thing worked well for many years.  icehammer  home made ice hammer,Nov 2007,Sep 21 2013,1

8356,In need of an XXS harness for a friend,1,0," One of my climbing partners is currently using an XS Mammut Vision climbing harness that was the smallest women's harness we could find at the time~ it went down to 23.5"". When completely tightened it still is a little loose on her on the waist and the legs~ she's like 5' 100lbs or so. Things have been fine with the harness until this weekend when she took a slightly penduluming lead fall. In the process her harness twisted and pulled to the side quite a bit(the tie in points ended up by her hip) and it caused her to flip due to the weight shift.    We've been trying to find a good solution for her~ but there doesn't seem to be any women's harnesses that are any smaller than that. I've posted a picture below showing the fit of her current harness.  XS harness   The one option we are considering is a kid's harness such as the BD wiz kid  rei.com/product/819456/blac…  but it only has 2 gear loops and no haul loop. We will sometimes use the haul loop to anchor her down so it is nice to have~ and the missing gear loops are a downer due to her needing them when following on trad routes and such since racking on a sling hurts her shoulder.

8393,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,0," Hey everyone! I would like to get into top rope soloing soon. I have read through many forum topics on MP about this~ but I still have some unanswered questions that maybe some of you experts could help me with. 1. What's a great static rope that's somewhere in the range of 10mm~ 60m~ and most importantly for a broke college student is inexpensive? Would it be wrong to use ""static canyon ropes"" for top rope soloing? (This rope looks promising. Any red flags? ​https://www.backcountry.com/edelweiss-canyon-everdry-rope-10mm?skid=EDL001T-ONECOL-S150FT&ti=U2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHM6c3RhdGljIHJvcGVzOjE6NjpzdGF0aWMgcm9wZXM=) 2. There are so many different ascenders that ""can"" be used for soloing~ and so many different primary vs. backup setups out there. What do you all recommend as the safest and smoothest setup?  I have heard that petzl micro traxions are very popular~ strong~ and safe. In fact many people just use 2 micro trax for their setup. But~ many people recommend using 2 completely different devices for redundancy. I like this idea because 2 micro traxions is freaking expensive for me right now. But of course buying more expensive stuff because it's safer is definitely a no-brainer for me. 3. What determines your primary vs. backup device? Is it better to have your ""favorite"" (safest~ strongest~ etc.) as your backup~ and a smoother device or less abrasive device as your primary that takes all the weight? I would like to know your thoughts on toothed vs. non-toothed devices as well.",Oct 2018,Apr 16 2020,2
8394,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,1, 1. Normally~ I use and would recommend a dynamic rope to alleviate the dynamic loading of your devices (that I will discuss in 2). I would use a burly rope to top rope solo. Static ropes are good too. Just go with a reputable manufacturer. Bluewater~ Edelweiss~ Mammut~ etc.  2. Micro traxions are adequate but are not designed to be dynamically loading. The trick is to minimize upward movement of the device if you were to stop so that the device doesn't catch you. Kind of like how if you were using a jumar and stopped~ you just sit onto the jumar.  I use 7mm loop tied with double fishermen's through my tie-in points. I clip a microtraxion to it with a locker. Then I use a double length sling to create a shoulder harness. I then take an elastic hair tie and girth it to the shoulder harness in the middle of my chest and clip it to the locker that holds the microtraxion. This helps keep the primary traxion up high and minimizes dynamic loading. Then I either back up my primary device with a gri gri~ jumar~ another microtraxion clipped to my belay loop and the rope.  3. Your primary device should be the one that takes your weight first when you stop moving upward. Just food for thought but if your primary device fails~ I would want my secondary device not to fail. It's a personal preference.,Oct 2017,Apr 16 2020,2
8395,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,2, Two microtraxs are the safest and smoothest bet~ use a bungee cord attached to a chest harness to keep it feeding smoothly. That being said~ I'll often find myself using a single gri gri and will just tie a knot in the middle of the rope - if I want to rap in and work a few sections for a project - which you can't do with a micro trax. When I want mileage I'll do the two device setup. Coil your rope and hang it off of the end - no need to bring bags or weights specifically for the setup. I would also heavily recommend a dynamic rope - static ropes would lead to more jarring catches.,Mar 2014,Apr 16 2020,7
8396,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,3, The ct rollnlock is a good device as is the grandwall uascend.  Some devices must be the top device because weight on the top of the device can defeat the device.  the weight comes from the top device not engaging and pulling down on the bottom device.  The uascend is an example of this.   Most people recommend using two different devices so you are less likely to make the same mistake twice~ like treading the rope backwards.,Feb 2006,Apr 16 2020,0

8402,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,9, I have a roll n lock but am unsure how to set it up correctly for tr solo. It's best as a primary device with a micro trax as backup right? Either can be top device.  I use a short quick draw with lockers to attach the rollnlock to the harness and a locker to attach the microtrax.  Then use a double length runner to form a chest harness and small string to tie to the rollnlock.  The point of this is to hold the rollnlock up so it does to interfere with the. Microtrax..  similar to the Steph Davis article above but with a short draw and 2 different devices.,Feb 2006,Apr 17 2020,1
8403,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,10, You should use a dynamic rope. A basic ascender is an effective and cheap alternative to all the expensive devices suggested. Camming style belay devices suck for tr solo. You have to pull the rope thru them which means being in a stance where you can free a hand. ,Sep 2019,Apr 17 2020,1
8404,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,11, I've been top rope soloing for a bit and price is also a concern for me. I'd recommend using a normal dynamic lead rope~ but that's been pretty well covered by others already. My system is a micro trax with a prussik as a backup~ which is about as cheap as you can get while still having redundancy. I have both the micro trax and the prussik on my belay loop with the prussik on top of the micro trax. I tie the prussik loose so the micro trax can just push it up the rope~ so it feeds really well and if the micro trax doesn't work the prussik will get me~ and prussiks are crazy cheap :) Also I tie a water bottle to the bottom of the rope to help keep it tight so the micro trax feeds better PM me if you have any questions!,Jun 2019,Apr 17 2020,0
8405,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,12, You can just use a Gri-Gri~ with two catches: 1. The rope feeds really poorly off the deck; you need a decent amount of rope weight below to hold the device facing down off your belay loop and to pull the rope through. Early on you'll have to pull rope through. 2. It easily cross-loads- mitigate this risk by putting a band of tape around the belay biner to keep the device at the top.  Advantages- you can easily lower and you'll have to buy a gri-gri which is an all around super useful device to have. Gri-Gri's are built to accommodate most modern rope sizes. Disadvantages- rope feeding is not optimal off the deck~ potential for cross loading You can couple a Gri-Gri and a micro-trax or other similar device to lead solo. Whatever setup you choose~ make sure you know how to escape a unidirectional capture device before you leave the ground and are prepared to ascend the rope should you be caught hanging away from the rock. ,Apr 2019,Apr 17 2020,0
8406,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,13, Long routes/sharp edges/cruxes near bottom = static rope. Shorter routes and/or cruxes last half of route = dynamic~ but either can work. If using a GG~ use dynamic because it will feed easier than a stiffer static. Would not use a prusik as a back-up. If only using one device use a back-up knot. If buying a primary device~ roll'nlock is the best deal and the lock-out feature is more positive than the microtrax when rapping.,Dec 2012,Apr 19 2020,0
8407,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,14, Static + Grigri would be just about the worst possible combination IMO. Three reasons why:  Poor feeding (as SIC said). Grigris feed worse than ALMOST any other device~ even with a dynamic rope.,Jul 2009,Apr 19 2020,2
8408,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,15," Perhaps a little pedantic~ but I think you mean ""safe enough"" and ""smooth enough"". Technically you could be safer by using different devices to avoid coincident failure modes~ e.g.~ a microtrax primary and rescucender backup on two strands. As for smoothest~ you can get many different systems to feed like butter merely by changing rope type/diameter. I agree that two microtraxxions is a perfectly fine setup~ but let's help the OP make the most informed and objective decisions about their own system before he goes out rope soloing.",Aug 2014,Apr 19 2020,4

8411,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,18, Good idea to avoid hyperbole :). We all use something different and the only objective evidence we have is who has broken ankles and who doesn't. So these threads are just piles of opinions from TRS survivors~ which is just about - but not quite - everyone who has tried it. I do (well~ did) approximately what Petzl suggested in https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Appendix-2--Detail-of-installation-on-two-ropes-with-two-ascenders?ActivityName=Multi-pitch-climbing All the single pitch stuff around me has always been less than half a rope length (else lowering/rapping off would be hard!) so I have more than enough rope. I just use my regular climbing rope. Lots of people use 1 strand with 2 ascenders with one held up by a chest harness. Using a chest harness of some sort feels more annoying and less useful to me than using 2 strands. 2 strands gives me reduced concern regarding unfriendly edges and more options~ since you can have a loaded and unloaded strand while hanging. Not that you need more options~ but when you're in the middle of nowhere alone~ hey it doesn't hurt. I have had my tshirt get all tangled up in a microtrax cam~ hopefully it would still have worked. I was only using 1 device 1 strand that day so didn't test it.,Apr 2015,Apr 19 2020,4

8413,Top Rope Soloing Questions,1,20, Use two microtraxions~ or one and a progress capture device but having two of the same is less of a pain in the ass. I use a nice static rope with some dynamic properties. Mainly because I use a static because when loaded over an edge~ won’t core shot as easily as a dynamic line.  Always check your line for worn sections of sheath.   Static ropes are workhorses~ dynamic is for playtime. Use rope pro when you can or limiting knots around sharp edges.  I always carry an ascender as well so I can get around cruxes or focus on sections specifically. I have only had my microtraxions open up only because I was down climbing the line to try a short section again. Im super aware that this will happen so I just tie a backup knot. I usually only want to go down a few feet so this is easy to estimate.  I also just tie a backup knot if I’m going to fall repeatedly in a section just in case. ,Jul 2010,Apr 19 2020,0
8414,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,0, 1. I have an Edelweiss low-stretch rope (meant for caving) that  I use for TR soloing. I don't think it's the same one that you linked~ but I don't know for sure - I've had it for a while. But it works great~ and I imagine that one would too. It's nice to have less stretch when TR soloing so that you stay in pretty much the same place if you fall. Just make sure to not let slack build up and use a chest harness or bungee around the neck to keep the device elevated (as others have mentioned).,Mar 2015,Apr 19 2020,1
8415,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,1, I like this system. One rope tied off at the anchor to have two strands. Microtraxion primary and Rescucender backuppetzl.com/US/en/Sport/Setti…,Oct 2009,Apr 19 2020,1
8416,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,2, Oh look! Another overly complicated TRS thread! If you want ONE DEVICE~ that will do everything~ Trango Vergo~ and tie a single backup knot. If you want ultra safe~ and ultra smooth~ use a CT roll n lock~ and. Micro trax. With bungee cord around neck. ,Jul 2014,Apr 19 2020,2
8417,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,3, To add an additional option~ one that I looked for forever based on two requirements. 1. No neck loop~ and 2. No teeth on the primary device. I ended up with the Camp Goblin for my main device~ and a Edelrid Spoc extended on a sling for my backup. The Goblin is an industrial device~ so it's even more bomber than the GriGri. It also runs perfect on the rope while climbing~ and only needs about a half full nalgene tied off on the rope for it to work smooth at the start. Best TRS device of all time~ imo. It is expensive~ but will last forever. Something no one has mentioned~ I recommend clove hitching to pro no more than 40ish feet apart~ otherwise rope stretch will be pretty big~ even on a static line~ and ridiculously big with a dynamic line. Most 90-100 ft routes just need one~ maybe two clove hitches. Also~ you need a clove hitch under any protrusions~ bulges~ or roofs to keep your rope from getting shredded. Something to look out for.,Sep 2017,Apr 20 2020,0

My point was merely that I think (and feel~ because we do make subjective decisions about safety) that it's worth considering this factor (amongst many other generally more important ones) when planning one's setup. If you don't think so~ that's perfectly fine. The OP~ as a newbie~ should make up his own mind about its relative importance. If you think that's taking things too seriously~ cool.

The Goblin locks up quick no matter what setting you have it on~ but if you dont need to down climb for any reason~ then leave it in ascension mode. This keeps the device cammed the whole time~ and it still moves easily up the line. I leave it in this mode all the time. ,Sep 2017,Apr 22 2020,0
8425,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,11, Personally I have just used a gri gri with backup knots tied every so often and stay on relatively easy routes.  No issues other than having to pull slack through.  The setters in the gym I go to set all the routes using that method actually.  Trying a micro traxion setup next outing.,Dec 2019,Apr 22 2020,0
8426,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,12, Keep in mind the goblin doesn't come with a shock pack ( unlike the asap) because it's designed to slide down the rope a small amount to dynamically stop the fall.  This likely wouldn't be true with the goblin on ascent mode mind you.  But yes~ the goblin is what you want for soloing.   Also~ the greatest risk to the rope access worker is cut lines.   So it would make more sense to me to have 2 fixed ropes~and one device on each.   If you can see the value in using 2 devices you should also be able to see the value in having 2 ropes.    be safe out there.  ,Feb 2020,Apr 22 2020,0
8427,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,13, That is noteworthy for sure~ but if you are mindful of features your rope is running across~ and clove hitching below any obvious wear points that may damage your rope~ then you can mitigate the potential for a cut line that way. When I do use a double strand~ I tend to have my main line attached to the pro~ and the backup is just floating out in space (on overhanging routes~ 95% of my tr soloing). This way~ you don't have the potential for a confusing twisted mess at each clip in point~ but youd go for a swing if you were ever caught by your backup only. So~ consider the consequences of both options.,Sep 2017,Apr 22 2020,0

8432,Top Rope Soloing Questions,2,18, A camp lift shouldn't be used as a backup device unless it is on another line.  If you are just using a single rope and the upper devices doesn't engage there is a chance the upper device will keep the Lift from engaging due to the way the camming action works.  A rollnlock would be fine.,Jun 2014,Apr 27 2020,0

This. Also~ I use sometimes use the Camp lift and backup it up with a gri gri. That way I can ascend and then descend with some ease~ its not ideal for 90 feet but a 10 foot crux section its not too bad. In fact if you can climb a section this way~ you can definitely do it on redpoint because you are kinda forced to pull double the slack or you have this weird loop form in your way. But a better version of this would be to mount your gri-gri to your chest and have a eldrid micro trax as a backup which I also do~ but this makes it much much harder to ascend the rope. ,Jun 2018,Apr 27 2020,2

But they're even worse as a backup below the primary device~ because it doesn't feed~ which means it brings the rope up with it~ which means your upper primary device doesn't move up either.

When gri gri on top and microtrax below it does pool which sucks. When I used two rope strands and lean in sometimes I end up between two ropes and its awkward~ or pull the wrong rope when trying to pull slack through the grigri because I am leaning and looking away~ or being an idiot stand on a ledge with one foot on one rope and your stumped why you can't move. Broadly the gri gri isn't great and hard to back up  but in specific use cases its okay.,Jun 2018,Apr 27 2020,0

8438,Top Rope Soloing Questions,3,4, I started solo climbing a couple years ago. Theres lots of different ways to go about doing it. Ill give you my way~ why and then alternatives. This will all be the same as you have heard from others but if youre anything like me~ you find what makes sense to you in an aggregated set of information. For TR solo you need a few things 1. Petzl - CLUB 200 10 mm~ Rope Designed for Caving and Canyoning https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BLM1CYI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_Wj2PEbCWFVYC0 2. Petzl micro trax 3. Jumar device 4. Grigri 5. One double sling 6. Several biners 7. Know how to tie alpine knot The set up is always the same on TR solo. You anchor to a place of your choosing ( figure 8 on at least a 5in diameter tree~ sling flake or chock stone~ chains~ etc) Rap down with GriGri. Disco the Grigri. Attach micro trax. Start climbing. That thing WILL catch you so compartmentalize your fear on that one. Every 20ft or so tie an alpine knot. I like this knot as a back up in case the Trax takes a shit or that lever on top of the micro trax decides to stay open (some have mod'd it to not engage - to each his own) this knot will catch you without fail and it can be done middle of the rope with one hand. And you just keep climbing until top out. If you find you cant finish the route then bail out with your jumar and sling to unweight the microtrax~ connect your Grigri and fuck off down the rope. I did that several times my first time out. And its really that simple. To rope solo on sport or trad is a lot different and requires a slow~ gradual progression of experience and comfort. You CAN NOT lead rope solo with your ego. You have to start off as if youve never climbed a 5.5 in the gym before. This part isnt easy and its not a game. You have to be smart if you wanna rope solo a sport or trad route. Get some experience at the gym with sport climbing~ practice placing gear~ practice weighting gear~ practice~  practice and when youre done with that~ practice some more. The last thing you want is to be on a multi pitch solo climb~ 200' off the ground~ rope ran out from the pack on your back~ or off the belay~ and with no one there to help you~ thats the time you have to learn. Fuck all that noise. Know what to expect by fuckin with the systems shortly off the ground. The lead rope solo thing aside~ TR solo is a bit more straightforward and there are a lot of routes you can go and imho it comes down to your experience and comfort level. Got the money and feel insecure about the venture but youre fuckin dead set on doin it? Get a silent partner. Google it if you arent aware. Wanna back up the microtrax with a Grigri or an asunder~ if you can make it work~ go for it. For me~ back up mechanical solutions were more trouble than solutions. And a grigri as an alt to microtrax didnt work for me. Even weighting a bag at the bottom of rope to make the grigri feed smoothly didnt work as advertised. Arbourist tools for ascension didnt pan out either. I finally settled on simple. Which i outlined above. As to static or dynamic rope. For me~ i settled on static because as a rope solo~ I shouldnt be taking any falls more than a few feet. Most static ropes~ and here~ specifically canyon ropes~ are semi static. So you have some give but not the~ what is it for an average dynic rope? Like~ 10% stretch. I dont need that on a couple foot fall. Because when~ if~ i have to unweight the microtrax system~ weighting that jumar on a double sling to unhook and hook up new systems with a bounce and elasticity working against me while im 100' off the ground sucks big time. Also~ if rope soloing on an over hang~ make sure as you rap down that you are~ if possible~  quick drawing the roof. Trust me~ you dont wanna come off the wall while rope soloing and swing massively into space with no help while you either try to cling back onto the wall or bail the system. Its a pain in the ass. Just anchor yourself to the wall as much as possible. Finally~  always tell someone where youre gonna be at specifically. Rope solo means you go it alone. Its tranquil~ a great way to decompress~ its very intimate and quiets the mind in a way i can only assume scratches the surface on a free solo. But you are alone on the wall. If you want to live when something goes wrong then someone has to know whats up~ when to expect a call from you and if they dont get that call then they need to raise a flag. Because you may or may not have your cell. During a fall or a goofy sequence you can easily lose that thing outta your pocket or smash it inside your pocket against the face of a wall. Im sure theres a bunch of small things ive forgot to mention but thats the basic jist of it. Be cool headed and have some common sense about you and you'll have fun. Ps. Single strand rope from anchor is the choice for me. No muss~ no fuss. That Trax will hold you just fine and over complicating things just didnt make sense to me. But~ different applications require different solutions. It may make more sense to double strand if anchors available are sketchy af. But for a typical crag~ which is where you need to start for a first rope solo acent~ for no other reason than its a totally different psychological experience to be belayed compared to belying yourself. You gotta get right with that aspect. Again~ theres a lot of ways to skin a cat. So you should try all avenues and get in where you fit in. Just dont be stupid. ,Jan 2019,Apr 27 2020,2
8439,Top Rope Soloing Questions,3,5, Curious as to people's opinions on Dave MacLeod's VERY simple TR solo setup.  He's been doing it for years...there's even a clip of him using it on the Rhapsody (and maybe Indian Face) video(s).  He's been using solely a Petzl Shunt (with a big maillon) on even his hardest projects...and he hasn't died yet.   Of course there are plenty of issues with relying on one device and I'm sure there's ways that the shunt can fail (as he addresses in the video below)~ but I'm curious to know if anyone else has any experience just using the Shunt.,Oct 2016,Apr 29 2020,0

8443,Rope length,1,1, One suitable for where you mostly climb.,Sep 2018,Apr 28 2020,15
8444,Rope length,1,2, 70 m~ 9.8 +/- 0.3 ish mm~ with a dry coat. Provides flexibility for rappels~ and safety on longer routes where lowering your partner off the end of your rope is less than ideal. If you live in Kansas and the biggest cliff you plan to climb 8 feet tall~ disregard what I said.,Apr 2016,Apr 28 2020,13
8445,Rope length,1,3, If I only had one rope for outdoor single pitches it would be a 70 meters (can do most things) of a medium diameter (so  its not too heavy or jerky in the belay device) something like the Beal Joker Edit: I know Beal Joker was consider cutting edge skinny~ but come on guys! It was like 15 years ago! Today I would say its on the skinny side but its no longer THAT skinny,Dec 2019,Apr 28 2020,3
8446,Rope length,1,4, Fwiw~ I purchased a 60m rope when starting out without understanding the area I planned to climb~ and found that I was quickly having to be really selective about where I could toprope.

EDIT: LOL...changed 'mm' to 'm',Apr 2020,Apr 28 2020,3
8447,Rope length,1,5," As others have said it depends on where you climb~ especially for length.  Generically I would get a big 10mm ish 60m rope which can take a lot of punishment.  That might not be the ""only"" rope for a more experienced climber but for a beginning outdoor climber that probably makes the most sense to me.",Sep 2016,Apr 28 2020,7

8450,Rope length,1,8, I started out with a 70 meter at 10.2. Sort of overkill but man that thing can take a lot of abuse. Now for cragging i mostly use a 60mm 9.8~ and a 9.5 70 meter for trad and unknowns. But as many people have said - it depends where you are climbing.

8456,Rope length,1,14, Ropes are only about ~$100 - $250 so I never understand why people only want to buy one of them.  They're cheap in comparison to other things in life so having to buy them isn't that big of a deal~ is it?  My first rope was a Mammut dry 70m and I beat the crap out of it.  Also~ lugging that long rope to a 10m wall was silly except the odd time we could tear drop for two top ropes. The next time I went non-dry but Mammut to save cash and wasn't as happy so now I stick to what I like. I own 30m for gym~ 40m (cut from the original 70 after a core shot) for the short walls around N. Texas and a 70M for trips out west.  ,Sep 2015,Apr 30 2020,1
8457,Rope length,1,15, Another vote for the 70 meter rope!  You might not need the extra 30 feet most of the time~ but you don't want your rope length to be the limiting factor to what you can or cannot climb. If the 70m is overkill for your area~ you can always invest in a razor blade and scissors~ and call it a lesson learned.  I'm in Reno/Tahoe and we have lots of variety of climbs and height. Several of my buddies have 60m ropes~ and all of them plan to get a 70m for their next rope.  ,Apr 2020,Apr 30 2020,0

8459,Rope length,1,17, Where do you climb???  The answer is totally dependent on that~ and if you top rope or lead climb mostly.  If leading~ is it all sport climbing?  If you climb mostly trad~ in an older climbing area~ you can get away with a much shorter rope since when those routes were put up~ all anyone had was a 150 ft rope. ,Jul 2015,Apr 30 2020,0
8460,CCW Chernobyl users-sizing,1,0, For those that own a CCW Chernobyl: how is the sizing? I ask because my Valdez pack is quite small. It is listed as 40l and definitely holds less than my Ozone (37)~ BI warthog (28) and Alpha FL 30. I love the pack~ but was really hoping for something bigger~ kind of why I bought it...I don’t want to be disappointed if I order the Chernobyl~ and the Chaos is absolutely more pack than I want. What say ye? ,Jan 2020,Apr 27 2020,0
8461,CCW Chernobyl users-sizing,1,1, I think CCW is pretty accurate on their sizes based off the two packs I have.  Chernobyl feels like 50L but expands up to around 65L~ and the Ozone feels like a solid 35L.  Basing this off owning lots of packs~ mostly from Black Diamond.  The ozone feels really similar to the BI Warthog 40L I had~ but the Chernobyl feels much bigger to me than both.  Hope this helps.  I was really interested in the Valdez but it seemed too big for any single day pushes~ but too small for overnights in winter.  Maybe I'll give it a second look.  How much smaller than the ozone do you think it really is? The Alpha FL30 is really a 23L with the ability to expand to 30L.  You think that pack is actually larger than the Valdez?,Jun 2012,Apr 27 2020,1

8466,CCW Chernobyl users-sizing,1,6, Warren thanks for the info on the Valdez.  I think at then end of the day my ideal pack would be a small version of the Chernobyl.  Seems like better attachment points and it takes a bladder.  I'd want some sort of strippable hip belt--something with removable padding or could be replaced with simple webbing. Been looking at the Tufa Mochilla pack a lot recently as an alternative~ but the Mochilla is only 21L+ some extension which seems small for winter stuff~ but the Valdez seems too big to climb comfortably.  Have you done much climbing with the Valdez on your back?  Did it interfere at all?,Jun 2012,Apr 28 2020,0

The larger pack definitely fits me better.  I have not measured the content~ but for me the Valdez always seems to be stuffed full~ even in summer~ where the Chernobyl works for me in winter trips (scrambling/snowshoeing not climbing) with a pile of extra clothing~ lots of food and such~ and carries and fits better than the Valdez while doing so. I think the description of 1-2 days trips or winter day trips is accurate.,May 2013,Apr 29 2020,1

8485,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,0, Wondering if anyone had thoughts on the CCW Chaos and if it can handle the loads of a West But. Denali climb? My gear is very slimmed down and lightweight (have done Aconcagua)~ so wondering if the CCW Chaos can do the loads demanded of Denali - namely 40lb. Thanks all! PS: If anyone has a CCW Chaos Large I would be interested!,Jan 2018,Apr 15 2020,0
8486,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,1, I think the Chaos could handle that much - or in any case I have lugged that much in mine.  But I'm skeptical that you will get by with only 40lb. on that route.,Apr 2009,Apr 15 2020,4
8487,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,2, Yes. If you can find a thin piece of plastic to create a quick framesheet~ it'll be even better.,May 2007,Apr 15 2020,2
8488,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,3, Sled to 14k and do it from there...yeah~ no problemo.  Ha ha. Hmmm.  Sled to 11k~ double or triple carry to 14k.  Then move up light to 17k with a good forecast. Yeah~ should do. Go in late May and summit in June.  Warmer means less sleeping bag and less warm clothes.,Oct 2003,Apr 15 2020,1
8489,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,4, Josh~ a 70L pack is slightly on the small size for Denali.   But people definitely make do with that size.    I've seen plenty of Hyperlite 70L packs up there.   The challenge with pack size is the day spent moving up to 17k camp.   Every other day on the mountain you could get away with a 30L pack and put everything in the sled.   My current Denali pack is the Montbell Expedition 80L which with the lid is more like other brands 90L packs.,Mar 2008,Apr 15 2020,1
8490,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,5," Handle? It won't break :-) Have you ever carried 40lbs or even 30lbs a considerable distance in a frameless pack? Like just casual backpacking?   For every question you ask there will be some hardman online to tell you they did it uphill both ways. Packs didn't have frames when men were men. They can sleep 12 fulfilling hours on a blue Walmart foam pad. They bivied at 17k in a 15F bag. I don't like carrying 40lbs on my back with a frame. So that'd be a hard ""no"" from me~ but I'm weak. ",Sep 2013,Apr 15 2020,5
8491,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,6, 40lbs? I’ve not been on Denali but have done lots of expedition peaks so correct me if I’m wrong here~ but 40lbs would be a minimum load. Moving to higher camps with exped gear can be double that. Sure you didn’t mean 40kgs? I’d be looking at a 90L dedicated exped pack and I’d pay to get it right. Ask anyone 4hrs into hauling a serious load what they’d pay to make it even one increment less crushing and they say ‘anything’.  Exped climbing is the logistical art of moving shit against gravity. The rest is details. Like your boots and sleeping bag~ put your $$$ into your load carriage system. You won’t regret it. ,Dec 2019,Apr 15 2020,1
8492,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,7, Im sure~ even if you decide that the chaos isnt right for you~ if you talk to randy~ and tell him what you need you will get the best pack you have ever had. At least that what i did. Dont regret that purchase one bit!,Jan 2019,Apr 15 2020,3
8493,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,8, Thanks all for the quick replies~ I am very experienced - just haven't had the big $$$ to do larger peaks other than Aconcagua. Done most of the big ones in the US and some in Canada~ though. I used an Osprey Xenith 88 on Aconcagua and it carried well~ but was a heavy pack. I have a Hyperlite SW 4400 for my winter set up and holds a Denali load well (-20 bag~ parka~ insulated pants~  1/2-1/3 VE 25~ cook wear~ mits~ etc~ basically all but the food).~ so that was the inquiry behind asking about the Chaos since it is roughly the same size~ but better outside attachment capabilities. I was thinking I would get the Chaos and add a ULA Catalyst foam-rod back panel for $15~ cut the foam pad down 2 panels~ and have a more capable load carrying system for cheap. I bought a CCW Valdez from Randy and absolutely love it~ so that's why I am wondering about the Chaos. Chaos with the sled no problem~ carries from different camps if doing a double carry would be food one day~ camp gear the rest~ so am just curious how those loads have worked with others.  *Aconcagua we had a crazy summit attempt and I ended up coming back down with at least 90lbs of gear. Of course that was my first 20 day expedition on a high mountain so I have learned a lot from that experience. My baseweight minus food~ fuel~ and water for an expedition is about $30-35lbs....basically: has anyone done Denali in a CCW Chaos? And~ what was their experience?,Jan 2018,Apr 16 2020,0

8495,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,10, So I have a hard-on for US made outdoor products and I fully support you giving CCW and ULA money...but especially if money is a concern I wouldn't be all that psyched on experimenting with a franken-pack. What if it doesn't work out as you envision? A backpack isn't as complicated as a Ferrari but maybe those parts just won't get along. ,Sep 2013,Apr 16 2020,2
8496,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,11, Assuming you climb the West Buttress conventionally (sled to 14~ with perhaps a couple gear ferries between 11 and 14k)~ the Chaos would be perfectly suitable. And CCW is a superb shop that makes excellent packs.,May 2011,Apr 16 2020,2
8497,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,12, As others have said~ if you are using as sled to 14 70l would be fine imo.  It does limit you abilty to ditch thd sled and packing is harder but should be fine.   ,Jan 2016,Apr 17 2020,0
8498,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,13, I used a BD Mission 75 on Denali and while the pack was often totally full~ I never wished for a larger one. We were a group of 3 and started out with 3 sleds. We left one at 11k and then ended up going to the summit from 14k. If you are planning on moving camp to 17k that would probably be when you'll be wishing you had a larger pack - there's just a lot of bulky gear depending on your group size (Shit can~ Big tent~ big sleeping bag~ Big puffy~ etc). But it'll definitely work. ,Aug 2016,Apr 17 2020,0
8499,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,14, I have a CCW Chaos which I like a great deal.   I also have a Gregory Denali~ which I used on a 10 day trip in Alaska (Mt Drum)~ which required backpacking pretty big loads (60#+/-) most of the way up the mountain~ sleds are not really an option there.  The internal frame makes a big difference in that scenario~ people on the trip with frameless packs were considerably less happy with their choice. I have never used sleds or been on Denali~ but if you are just thinking of backpacking heavy loads then I wouldn't go for the Chaos~ as much as I love it.,Sep 2016,Apr 18 2020,3
8500,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,15, Thank you all for your help (especially Chaos owners)! I love my Valdez but most are probably right - the Chaos could work~ but a frame is better.

8502,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,17, It sounds like you have 2 perfectly good packs for Denali.  We did Denali on a pretty shoestring budget~ and limited buying specialized gear.  If money is really a hindrance~ then I would just use the zenith and the Hyperlite and call it a day.  I brought the aether 70 and a  30L pack. I eventually just put the big pack fully loaded in my sled with the duffel and would only wear the smaller pack. I used the same set up on Aconcagua and had success on both mountains.  I'm happy to help with any other tips~ questions or advice.,Jun 2014,Apr 24 2020,1
8503,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,18, If the added weight is a vastly improved suspension I would take the weight in a heartbeat.   The bmg was the perfect pack~ except that for me is was extremely uncomfortable with any weight in it.  I sold mine immediately.,Jan 2016,Apr 25 2020,0

8505,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,1,20, The one thing to consider with a 4000cu in / 70L pack is that while you can probably get everything in there your are going to be spending time stuffing the hell out things. Which often means not being able to wear thick gloves or mittens. It is much easier to be able to dump shit in there cinch down the straps and go. Also when you do need something you can open the pack up root around without taking stuff out.,Jul 2007,Apr 29 2020,3
8506,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,2,0, Hey~ ARS~ curious what pack you used on Denali? I used the old Dana Design Astralplane.  Big pack.  Appreciated real suspension for the real weight carried. Be nice to have a small~ light pack...so says my back...ha ha. One thing I've used a number of times is a sleeping bag stuff sack that doubles as a summit pack.  Basically a really light pack with shoulder straps.  Mines a semi custom rig that Serratus used to make.  I think Lowe (Alpine Attack Summit?) still makes one.  MEC might too.  Pretty handy for a summit parka and other stuff for a summit bid.  I always dislike the thought of re configuring my pack lid as a fanny pack...and they don't hold or carry much or well especially with a harness on.  Even with the stays removed and my main pack stripped down~ its a heavy rig.  Glad to leave it (intact) at high camp.   I see BD has a new pack that weighs...one ounce.  Not sure big enough for a 0 to -20 degree bag...but...that's light.,Oct 2003,Apr 29 2020,0
8507,Cold Cold World Chaos for Denali climb?,2,1, Hey BDC~ I took my old Lowe Contour IV up the Cassin and had it on the East Butt too. It was heavy but carried good and the zippered lower compartment was a plus. Of course we carried up and over so it was the summit pack. it is now long gone. On Foraker I used a Wild Things Andanista. Good pack but not for carrying a heavy load though. Some of these super light day packs now make a great summit pack. Especially as one can cinch them down too so they make a good stuff sac for a sleeping bag or tent.,Jul 2007,Apr 29 2020,0

8509,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,0, Wondering how others color code their offset cams for racking?  I typically climb with bd cams and have a color matching neutrino for each which makes grabbing the right cam simple.   Not sure what color biner to put on my offset cams to avoid confusion.  Curious what others do here...,Jul 2016,Apr 29 2020,0
8510,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,1, Two biners per cam. One of each color makes the most sense (opposite and opposed of course).,Jun 2017,Apr 29 2020,68
8511,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,2, I use silver/grey rack for offsets~ but I stripe the top of the 'biner with the two offset sizes using cheap nail polish. It introduces a bit of upkeep~ but it makes it very easy to see my sizes and options at a glance.,Jul 2018,Apr 29 2020,3
8512,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,3, I have stopped paying much attention to colorcoding my biners - I find that I don't look the biners at all when glancing at my rack before placing. I normally glance at the cam itself~ or simply figure out the piece via touch/remembering where I racked what. I would recommend just buying a specific color biner that is different than all of you other cams to make it clear that these are the offsets - which offset exactly~ you would be able to figure out pretty quickly. Though it is easiest to climb with offsets that are of a different brand than your regular cams so that you can figure this out more quickly via touch. I still have the main cams color coded (don't think it makes a big difference)- but everything else is just on a silver spirit biner. Haven't run into any issues with identifying my gear and placing quickly. Maybe others have a different system.,Mar 2014,Apr 29 2020,3

8516,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,7, this works with metolius and totem basic (and makes most sense~ IMO)... but not with BD~ unfortunately. Alas~ if you have BD~ as others have said~ not that big of a deal~ unless you're climbing at such a high level that you need the right cam NOW!...and then~ in that case~ you can prob figure out which cam is which without even looking~ so color is (mostly) moot.,Aug 2017,Apr 29 2020,0

8518,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,9, I also go with black biners on the offsets. Works fine for me~ however I rarely carry more than three of them at a time so they aren't a large part of my rack.,Mar 2015,Apr 29 2020,2

8520,What colour biner for offset cams?,1,11," I've found colored racking biners aren't really about helping me pick the correct cam~ it's more about making it easy to put the cams back in the correct place to stay organized. For non-offsets I like two different brands of each size in the smaller sizes because they each may fit different placements a little better. e.g. a black totem and a blue metolius. When I put them away~ because the brands are usually a little different in size~ rather than having to compare them visually to see where they go~ but then see one is a tiny bit bigger and think ""maybe this is the next size up?"" I know if they both have black biners they belong together. I pefer to rack offsets seperately in their own group. That way if I see a placement that needs an offset it's easier to find the correct one. i.e. I look a the placement then look at my offsets and it's easy to see the correct size one~ vs. if they're mixed in between regular cams. I use the biner color for the larger sized lobes. If you wanted to get fancy you could put a piece of tape or nail polish for the color of the smaller sized lobes on the top of the biner~ that would identify them as offsets withouth having to look at the cam itself (so it would be a little quicker when re-racking). And if you had multiple sets of offsets it would be easier to keep them organized as I mention above.",Oct 2011,Apr 29 2020,3

8538,Ice/mixed climbing recommendations,1,3, As Daniel said~ boots that fit are important.  Personally I like the grivel g20 crampons. But for learning it might be beneficial to try both a mono point and duel point setup. Ice fests are a great place to demo gear before deciding what to buy. Additionally they’re great for learning basic skills and to meet other ice climbers.  As for tools~ I feel like the trango raptors are a great tool for a steal of a price.

8539,Ice/mixed climbing recommendations,1,4, It’s all very personal taste~ perhaps even more than trad gear. All the gear from the major makers are capable and great each with pluses~ minuses~ and “feel” differences. you’re just gonna have to start putting mileage on borrowed/rented gear or spend $$$ and sell/trade to your personal perfection. Living in GA is not conducive to this :) I speak from experience as a LAX to BOS transplant.BD~ Petzl~ Grivel~ Cassin~ Trango (tools) are all valid options.

Living in the South~ your crux is going to be finding partners and ice.You already know you’re going to have to travel~ and the easiest line is to start with the various ice festivals—the earliest is Bozeman in December. Sign up for a couple of clinics. You can show up practically naked and demo everything: jackets~ gloves~ boots~ harnesses~ crampons~ tools...maybe wear your own pants and socks and don’t forget your helmet. You could hit a different state every month (if you wanted to) and try out all kinds of gear~ experience some cool climbing towns~ meet a lot of people and get good—even great—instruction from the experts.  Alternatively~ you could drop a lot cash acquiring gear. But then it’s up to you to figure out all the rest of it: where and when to go~ who to climb with~ and how.,Dec 2009,Apr 29 2020,3

8561,Beal or Sterling. Thoughts?,1,1, Sterling is my favorite for durability and feel when handling. Beal also makes good ropes. Either way get a bipattern. Much easier when rappelling. No need for finding a middle marker,Apr 2009,Apr 27 2020,4

8564,Beal or Sterling. Thoughts?,1,4, Beal Stinger III is a favorite rope of mine. I've had several over many years. Inexpensive~ great impact force numbers~ handles well~ soft and supple. It's the rope I always return to after trying others~ Sterling included. I've had a couple Sterlings and both ended up feeling more stiff than I liked. They hold up well though. ,Oct 2005,Apr 27 2020,2

8566,Beal or Sterling. Thoughts?,1,6, Both are excellent. I would probably choose a Stirling if things were equal but they usually cost significantly more. Durable ropes with nice handling.  Beals- these feel like the softest catching ropes I have used. Some models like Booster and Stinger wear very well~ and stay springy well into their life. I’ve also bought the Beal low end rope- this was the Yuji 10.0 a few years ago. Doesn’t wear as well~ not quite as polished~ but took a fair amount of abuse for the low price.  TLDR- both are good~ buy the less expensive rope.  And where you finding $80 Beals??  ,Nov 2006,Apr 27 2020,0

8568,Beal or Sterling. Thoughts?,1,8, If you're planning to use the rope for frequent toproping or for projecting something where you want to be able to try the same move repeatedly~ watch out for the static elongation numbers on the Beal ropes. I'm a big fan of the unicore construction they have now~ but the static elongation on some of their ropes (9-10%; some even higher than 10% I think) is much more than most other climbing ropes. Lots of people seem to like the *very* soft falls this creates~ but it could be super frustrating if you're trying to work a project (or even somewhat dangerous if you fall low on a long toprope where the rope stretch could put you on the ground).,Aug 2019,Apr 28 2020,3
8569,Beal or Sterling. Thoughts?,1,9, I hope so~ I have a cheap beal as my gym rope! (I paid equiv to 116USD (180AUD) for a no-frills beal karma 9.8mm 50m~ things here tend to be more expensive than in America). ,Apr 2015,Apr 28 2020,0

They feel the most aggressive on heel hooks~  and they're also the most form-fitting of what I've tried.  Can anyone point out other shoes that have a similar heel shape/aggressiveness? I'd stay with Evolv but the rubber is too thick and soft~ so it's insensitive and rolls off edges way more than other shoes.

8595,Petzl Rig Opinions and Thoughts,1,9, I like mine. When I toprope with someone for the first time~ I let them belay me on the RIG so they could have terrible PBUS form and never be caught off guard. Irresponsible~ I know~ and they could totally drop me on the lower~ so I guess this doesn't make sense. The Petzl RIG and I'D with opening sideplates are by the far the most popular rope access rappel devices~ as such they are probably subject to the most use and abuse of any device out there. If people were blowing out the sideplates we would have heard about it.  It was optimized for 11mm ropes which are industry standard. I find the rappel to be sporty with 10mm sterling htp~ so a wide open RIG on 9mm rope is legit free fall. The handle has much higher opening leverage and no antipanic. Even if you're not prone to panic~ you could experience a freak accident like dropping a tethered tool and it holding the handle open~ and I assume you won't have a fall arrest device on a redundant second rope.,Jun 2019,Apr 22 2020,2

I have never had issues getting hung up on that handle even with multiple tethers~ etrier~ drill~ and other paraphernalia. I'm glad I didnt mess with the handle. This device is absolutely perfect in every respect. The way the handle is designed~ it rotates with a large circular cap on the left side~ which bulges out slightly. This bulge keeps any personal anchors that are in direct~ and forced tight to the handle side of the Rig~ to not effect the handle rotation at all. I've had a few scenarios where going in direct pulls my personal into the handle of the Grigri~ and it forces you to have to manipulate the cord before you can pull slack through. With the Rig~ even with the larger handle~ there was no interference with anything at all~ and I attribute that to the design of that side piece connected to the handle. Great work Petzl! Also~ the Rig is absolutely killing the Grigri on ascents. The way the cam rotates out of the way as you pull in slack means it creates a lot less friction. Totally worth the upgrade if you are working on and jugging lines a lot. 10/10,Sep 2017,Apr 28 2020,2

8624,CAMP Goblin,1,1," Hi! I've used it as my primary device on me belay loop~ propped upright with a single sling chest harness. I've only logged about 10 hours on it so far. It feeds very easily. Smoother than the ASAP in my experience. I don't have to weight the rope underneath as with other set-ups. I've experienced one instance of the rope not feeding for a brief moment while climbing on two lines~ one with the Goblin and one with Gri Gri. I'm not sure exactly what produced the blockage but my guess would be either A) I leaned too far forward creating extra friction on both ends of the device B) there was some touching between the two lines that engaged the cam. From what I've observed in fall-arrest mode~ the cam engages not from downward pull but from down and out; so down climbing slow-ish-ly should not engage~ but letting go of the wall should. If you have a huge reach~ you could possibly engage the cam accidentally if you squat with arms extended to lean back on a slightly overhanging route. But it unlocks easily when you take your weight off of it. I haven't really used ascension (""locked in place"") mode. It's the same cam though. ✌️",Feb 2020,Apr 25 2020,1

8627,CAMP Goblin,1,4," It will~ provided your attachment lanyard~ etc is nearly vertical to the Goblin. Then it will ""lead"" you down quite well as you downclimb. However if you pull back a bit and the lanyard begins to leave the Goblin at a bit of an angle (from vertical)~ you have to tend it on the way down. And in either mode~ it will catch if you fall. I use one as my fall prevention device~ while climbing the framework of a climbing wall~ for maintenance purposes.

8630,CAMP Goblin,1,7, I got a goblin a few weeks ago to self belay with on my home wall. The wall is 20ft tall and slightly overhanging. With a bit of modification I’ve found it works really really well both up and down. (I mainly do circuits up and down and the goblin is awesome for the ability to climb unencumbered and not even think about it being there) However I have created very specific conditions for the device to not lock up on the way down. 1) I down climb directly in line with my fixed rope not out to the side. 2) I hang the device directly off my belay loop but above it I have a small non load bearing carabiner attached to my chaulk bag strap via a magnetic coupler (my magnet was repurposed from my fishing net quick release and is VERY strong) I clip this to the fixed rope and it tends the rope running over the tiny pulley in the goblin and encourages it not or lock up. If I fall the angle changes pulling apart the “magnet rope tender” and engaging the devise. I think this is superior to the rope surfer and lanyard but I haven’t tried it. 3) I slightly weight the rope with a shoe or something to keep it feeding through device I did not get a CAMP rope surfer lanyard as mentioned above because it looks like it would make the fall enormous without a chest harness which I don’t like. I don’t see how it would work well to extend it that high as your chest is often farther from the wall and would engage the devise easier than if at your hips which stay against wall. I also don’t think that little horseshoe think will run up and down the rope and resist enough outward force to be effective  I have learned from this: 1) the angle the rope entering the goblin must be managed somehow to make downclimbibg reliable. 2) even with modifications if you are not within a few degrees (>5-10) of plumb below your anchor the rope angle will cause the devise to engage.3) falling on the goblin is a little spooky if it’s hanging right off your belay loop and it slides a bit on skinnier than recommended ropes.  Also unless your gonna rig some crazy double goblin redundant setup (which would weigh a ton) it’s hard to make it redundant when down climbing and therefore why not just have two micro trax? So I love my goblin as a cheap “auto belay” and it works really well under those circumstances. I don’t think it would work as well out at the crag unless you’ve got a plumb route which for some reason you want to down climb large sections of. Would love to see if anyone else has used a rope surfer for this purpose or some other mod for down climbing although I’m happy with my setup. ,Sep 2017,Apr 27 2020,0

Everything above this is ""value added"" in the multitude steps of chemical processing~ fiber-making~ rope braiding~ marketing~ distribution~ and sale. So what~ you say?

However an engineer friend of mine did tell me that if a material goes up in price (or you use a more expensive part) that cost is multiplied like 8 times before it actually gets to the consumer~ so if a rope is $200 and the nylon costs $10 but drops to $8 the climber might see a savings of $16. But larger supply/demand things related to so much climbing being closed right now and so many stores being closed will effect price before oil prices trickle down.,Apr 2015,Apr 27 2020,0

I don't remember where I got that~ but for many commodities~ if you track the prices since data/estimates are available~ prices tend to be flat/declining over long (decades/centuries).

8677,When do you retire a belay carabiner?,1,1, i replaced mine not long after i noticed grooves in the biner from rappeling and stuff.  the mere fact that i could tell there was less metal there than when I bought it was reason enough.  plus (i think)~ the grooving increases the amount of surface area of the carabiner that the rope interacts with.  more surface area = more drag~ which i'm not into when using an auto-block device.,Apr 2008,Dec 2 2009,3
8678,When do you retire a belay carabiner?,1,2, Here's a related question for you techie types.

8746,Spotting scope for el cap,1,2, If you plan on looking through it for a long period of time then you might want to spend more than $80 and maybe a bit less than a Swarovski.

8752,Spotting scope for el cap,1,8, I bought a pair of Barska bincs once as they were so cheap. Cheap also described their view~ they were terrible and total pieces of crap.

8762,Spotting scope for el cap,1,18, I was also looking into getting one for similar purposes~ though I haven't decided yet. A few I was looking at in the 200-300 dollar range that are all 20-60x80mm:meade.com/binoculars-spotti…barska.com/20-60x80-wp-leve…telescope.com/Orion/Orion-G…  For that distance you could probably get a 60mm one and be fine but I'm just guessing. From what I gather~ the markers of quality glass are BAK-4 prisms~ fully multi-coated optics~ and ED (extra low dispersion) lenses. I haven't seen those all in one lightweight package for under 500.,Apr 2020,Apr 26 2020,1

8764,Spotting scope for el cap,1,20, From what I've seen~ good glass is just as expensive if it's a zoom lens for a camera or a spotting scope.  Taken from the meadow (and seemingly downsampled by MP). For what OP has stated he wants to do~ the Lumix dc-fz80 setup is going to be more than enough. These were also taken without a tripod. ,Jan 2007,Apr 27 2020,3
8765,Spotting scope for el cap,2,0, The orion one is 3.5 lbs which I'm ok with. Waiting to hear back from them on what prism it has. I really haven't seen any reviews of the Meade or Orion one anywhere. I think Barska is making some better models now.

8767,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,1, Tony~   I had a Marmot Precip jacket~ and liked it (for the most part). Well priced (~$100)~ light~ and waterproof. Downsides were that it didn't fit me very well (too baggy)~ and it did not breathe well~ either. I replaced it with a Marmot Rim Jacket~ which is a couple of ounces heavier~ but much more breathable~ and the fit is excellent. I currently take it when I do not need a full-on Gore Tex shell (ie summer forays in the Rockies~ etc).

It's very small~ fits in a 3"" x 2 1/2"" stuff sack and waterproof. The only thing I don't like is that it is coated and does not breath. For something to hook on the back of my harness~ it has served me well.

8771,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,5, For a true long lasting jacket I vote for Gore Pac-lite:(taken off the web)              GORE-TEX® PACLITE® is 'Guaranteed To Keep You Dry'® and uses a protective layer on the membrane that allows water vapour to pass through~ but prevents contamination from oil cosmetics~ insect repellent and food substances which could otherwise affect the garment’s waterproof performance. The ultimate in waterproof~ breathable~ lightweight and packable weather protection~ PACLITE® by GORE-TEX® is so light (every garment weighs <500gms!)  and easy to stow away~ you’ll take it with you everywhere. The perfect travel companion.   Most other waterproof breathables are not chemically inert like Gore's PTFE so if you get white gas or deet or another caustic chemical on them the waterproofness goes away...,Jan 2006,Jul 21 2006,0
8772,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,6," So other than Mike's suggestion~ which packs down to < 3"" sq. how small do the rest pack down to?  My jackets are all way bigger~ and I'd love to get something baseball-sized or smaller. Tennis ball sized is even better.",Jan 2001,Jul 21 2006,0
8773,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,7, I use a marmot precip jacket as well. They're inexpensive and if you find the right sized stuff sack they can be made really small so you can just hang it off your harness next to your trail shoes. It fits in the palm of your hand.   They're great for climbing in the Park when you get caught in an afternoon storm. They're not just shower proof but rain proof!   Also the warranty is great. I used my for a couple years~ every weekend while doing the 14er's and biking the Colorado Trail and at the end of the two summers it had started to deliminate around the in places where I was wearing a pack. Since I used to work in the outdoor gear business~ I sent it back to marmot so they could take a look at it and told them that it had been used practically every day and I wasn't asking for it to be repaired as I had already purchased another one~ but thought they might like it for R and D.   Needless to say they sent me another one!,Jul 2002,Jul 21 2006,0
8774,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,8, I have Northface's Lightspeed Jacket with gore-tex paclite. It weighs 14 oz and packs to about a baseball. I really like it~ and its great for climbing because it has core venting~ not pit zips to get caught on stuff while moving around. I also looked into the Outdoor Research Zealot jacket~ but decided against it~ opting for a bit heavier shell. The zealot is also paclite lined but packs down to tennis ball size. Drawbacks are that it lacks any venting options~ and obviously~ price.   The lightspeed can be found at a decent price here: sierratradingpost.com/produ…,Jun 2006,Jul 21 2006,0
8775,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,9," The Marmot ""Essence"" Jacket packs much smaller than the Precip. It is made of ""pre-cip"" material~ but has no pit-zips or pockets for your hands.  I love mine.  The medium weighs only 7.5oz.  It comes with a full front zipper.",Feb 2003,Jul 21 2006,0
8776,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,10, Tony~ I've the Cloudveil Zorro. I think it's a little bigger than the small light shells @ 14.5. But I think it's solid protection and I can't seem to damage it in alpine chimney or Vedauwoo OW.    It's zipper with large outer hand pockets also zippered (but no chest pocket - interior or outer)~ has draw strings to seal head and torso~ and velcro to seal over wrists & chest zipper - been kept totally dry in monsoonal rains. The only thing I think better & more durable would be an Arcterix~ which needs a small mortgage.,Dec 2005,Jul 21 2006,0

8779,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,13, I use the Arcteryx Alpha Comp Hoody and it's awesome. GoreTex where it counts and soft shell for the rest. One of the best jackets I've ever had. Completely waterproof~ yet not quite as hot as a full GoreTex setup. A little pricey if you pay retail~ but search around and you can do pretty well. The other nice thing about Arcteryx is they have a bomber warranty for life.,Apr 2006,Aug 29 2006,0

8781,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,15, If you want this end of the spectrum~ it was probably an ad for the the patagonia houdini. It is really useful for how small you can ball it up~ but I'll throw the caveat out there that it's not really super waterproof in a significant downpour. It'll get you a few miles in light to medium rain if necessary though~ before gets saturated and starts soaking through. Maybe you could nikwax it or something~ but I've never looked into it for mine.,Feb 2017,Apr 26 2020,0

8786,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,1,20, I've got an OR Helium 2 and a Rab Downpour. The Helium definitely is smaller but not a lasting as the Downpour. I don't believe any single or double layer (like the Downpour) will keep rain out for hard extended time unfortunately. 3 layer with Gtx is the best for longevity and hard weather. I'm not sure the quality of their Paclite as I've never used it but it's definitely making waves in the light weight rain protection categories. Might be worth looking at. ,May 2017,Apr 27 2020,0
8787,Best 'packable' waterproof jacket?,2,0, The Houdini is a great lightweight and packable windshell~ but it in no way is meant to be waterproof. It can work in a pinch~ and is a lot more breathable than a truly waterproof jacket~ but you will get wet if you wear it in anything more than a light mist for more than ~15 min. The OR helium is meant to actually be waterproof~ and is very close to the Houdini in terms of packability and weight~ but is significantly worse in terms of breathability. Something with goretex paclite~ like the arcteryx zeta sl~ will be a good amount more breathable (and this more comfortable to wear)~ but is both more expensive and a bit heavier/less packable. By the way~ these all serve as examples~ and are not necessarily the exclusive and/or the best piece in each category. ,Oct 2019,Apr 27 2020,0

It packs down small enough to not know it is there~ won't keep out a driven rain~ but is better than most jackets of this ilk. Built for flash-storm protection~ the 100% waterproof~ breathable Helium II Jacket weighs an incredibly light 6.4 ounces.

8798,Trango flex cams,1,7, I would not buy them and would avoid climbing on a rack with them. I bootied one off my project but I knew I would never use it and it would just collect dust so I walked it to the next crag and found the guy who left it (I had seen him walking in that direction) Also had a friend blow the ~.3 sized one and there was damage to the metal on one of the lobes (he assumed that's why it blew~ I dunno if it was his fault or the cam),Apr 2015,Apr 20 2020,0

8802,Trango flex cams,1,11, I have a set of 1-9 to supplement my black diamond rack. That is about the equivalent of bd .2 to 4 but they tend to be slightly in between the bd sizes. My experience has been that there isn't much of a difference between them and my c4s. I've only been trad climbing for a year or so~ but I've built anchors with both~ I've fallen on both~ neither seems more prone to walking or getting stuck to me.

8806,Trango flex cams,1,15, I don't have them~ but I have used them. Never fallen on one~ but I did hang and lower when I needed to retry a move. Didn't die. They're tested and certified. When they go on sale~ they often sell out quickly~ so people are using them. If people were routinely dying after falling on them~ Trango would be out of business. The main raps against them seem to be that they aren't as durable as some others and that they walk more. I don't know about the former~ but I do know some about the latter. When I used the #9 several years ago~ it walked every time~ even when I extended beyond the extendable sling. But I never had any issues with the other sizes.

8811,Trango flex cams,1,20, My buddy probably still has a couple that never come out to play. They were his first cams. We fell on them~ they work.

8842,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,2,8, It is interesting to note the level of unanimity about rappel backups~ and then you have people who probably wouldn't rappel without a backup lowering with a guide plate---yes even a Pivot---with no backup.  Actually~ there is nothing in the rappelling system remotely like what happens when you over-tilt a loaded guide plate; the guide plates are far more likely to produce a sudden bad event.  All plates will release suddenly---quite possibly with catastrophic consequences---and although the Pivot is more controllable than the others~ it is by no means failure-proof.    If the second isn't just dead weight hanging on the rope---if they can unweight it momentarily---then I think the load strand direct (LSD) method is the way to go (but still with a backup).   If the second can't unweight the rope~ there is a rather kludgey LSD work-around  ,Feb 2008,Apr 9 2020,29

8847,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,2,13, We definitely do not need these naysayers telling us when we can and can't climb. Who cares about knowing the skills of our climbing partners? It's all about me anyway. If my climbing partner can't do the 5.6 then I'll just recall what I read in the user manual and lower her down. Good thing I tied that Munter hitch and saved her life. I'm so smart. I've been climbing for so long anyway that if a serious accident was going to happen~ it would've already happened by now. I will never need a rescue crew to help me because I am basically accident-proof by this point.

8848,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,2,14, I’ve only released an autoblock when practicing it just to know the techniques for lowering in auto-block mode. Just from that practice the binary on/off release made me sure I wouldn’t lower more than 10-15 feet that way. I used a reverso and maybe a megajul but if it’s just a short adjustment for climber to work a move I feel comfortable putting a carabiner in the lowering slot and gently using it as a lever.  I think spirits go all the way through and some of mine get hooked around the nose~ the ones that nose hook are what I prefer because it makes it a more effective lever. If it’s longer 10-15ft or climber is heavy I’d use a sling through masterpoint and friction hitch/munter backup for more control. If lowering for an entire pitch I’d rather not do it by defeating guide mode and would instead load transfer and lower normally. Only done it in practice with partner on easy terrain but moved load onto a friction hitch on the load stand and lower with gri gri if I have it or remove the atc and lower regularly. Way easier to transfer load than it is to lower in guide mode.  If anyone is itching to do something climbing related now may be a good time to practice various rescue techniques.,Mar 2017,Apr 9 2020,0

8863,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,3,9, It will always be a little tricky to release~ but you should be doing that with your foot~ while you death grip the brake strand (redirected through a high point) so when you succeed in rotating the device~ you can just lower normally (only upside down). And when you break the belay the climber does not move (you are holding the brake). I always have a double length sling on me when I will belay from above~ and that is what I step in to break the belay~ after threading it through the hole in the atc guide. On the smart you could thread it through the housing~ like in picture 7 in the earlier posted smart manual. What I don't agree with is the hand below the device with no redirect of the brake strand in that photo. then your foot is controlling the rate of descent in a very unnatural way.

8868,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,3,14, As mentioned lowering in guide mode on an ATC style device is a pain. I've lowered for a few feet with an petzl reverso~ so someone could get back to a rest spot before giving it another go and it's fine for that. But I've always used the sling redirected through the anchor method~ which works good. I don't like that those directions show just using the end of that device~ I can see how that's either full lock or full release~ bad idea to encourage that method IMO~ no control.   If there's any chance of having to lower someone to the bottom of the pitch it would be worth the extra weight to bring a gri-gri. However guide mode on a reverso is much more secure than on a gri-gri~ so I feel comfortable casually holding the end of the rope and arranging the rack~ taking photos~ etc. If using a gri-gri I know it could take a number of feet before it locks up so a much more attentive belay is required and I won't multi-task. And of course you could always belay off your waist with a redirect if you think you may need to lower out the pitch.,Oct 2011,Apr 10 2020,2

Learn the proper technique and you won’t kink the rope. Climb safe~Mal,Jan 2001,Apr 10 2020,7
8881,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,4,7," A DMM Pivot is especially designed for the lowering where you invert the devise~ usually this method is the method that offers the least amount of control while lowering your climber. Mammut also uses this same system with their devise~ the sad part is that in their diagram that they offered it doesn't show the redirection of the break strand. If you do this step then you can maintain easier control of the lower~ you will need to put on a friction hitch on the break strand so you don't loose control and drop the climber all the way to the ground. You used a Munter hitch~ was it on your belay loop or the anchor? I'm assuming you used your belay loop~ having the Munter hitch rather than a friction hitch could make the lower a lot more awkward than it has to be- however that being said it was right of you to use a Munter hitch if you didn't redirect the break strand. If you hadn't done that and just held the rope in your hand then your partner would have zipped straits to the ground. Overall there are a little too many variables that we would need to see for anyone on this forum to offer you the proper advice to fix the problem you described. That being said--  One easy way to fix everything is to change up the lowering method~ there is a newer method of lowering a follower that most guides have been switching to using and teaching. It's called the ""load strand dependent~"" or ""load strand direct~"" or ""LSD"" for short. This video shoes the older method and the newer method together~ the LSD method works with any devise that is set up the same as an ATC guide devise so it should work just fine on the Mammut Smart.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx8JP4TRJlM ",Feb 2016,Apr 10 2020,1

8883,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,4,9, Yeah~ if I go climbing with this particular person again I will belay from my harness. Hey Jared~ I agree with most people here that you did the right thing given the circumstances. I think belaying off the anchor is likely still preferable~ but just practice the transition from belaying to lowering. It's like an optimistic vs. pessimistic approach... You should set up your belay system to optimize performance in support of your goal (of finishing the route~ I would assume). Think about easy solutions that would allow your climber to reach the top first~ and then progress to more complicated solutions only IF the situation requires it. One way to mentally organize this info is as follows: You can bring your climber UP: 1.) tight belay~ encouragement~ and coaching 2.) Hard pull (also vector pull) to take weight off climber and haul rope through belay device,Jun 2014,Apr 10 2020,0

I have been watching this thread progress over the past day and half~ and it dumb founds me that you keep returning to seek more information. You’re asking for trouble if you think people encouraging you or giving climbing system advice over MP are going to give you information that will translate correctly over the forum and be performed correctly in the real world. When it’s clear you’re already laking the experience to perform said tasks correctly. Albeit performing that task incorrectly with another persons life and well-being tied into the other end. If you didn’t know 100 percent how to lower a climber from the anchor you shouldn’t have tried to lower the climber. All belay devices have their caveats including Gri Gris. You’re lucky you had it backed up or it wouldn’t have stopped the followers fall in just a couple feet(And you know this from your original post). So this sounds like a near miss to me... End of convo. Time to get some proper instruction~ and NOT from a forum on MP.Here’s my two cents if you already couldn’t guess it. When we’re not in the midst of a global pandemic and if you have the time and money hire a qualified guide to take you over the systems. It will be the best money you ever spent and the guide will be thankful to have you as a client I’m sure.Best~RP.S.- I’m one of those people who spent money or  worked a job that helped cover some of the cost of guided courses to improve my rope skills.

In all my years of climbing I’ve never done guide-mode lowering. It’s something that’s been in my head and I probably could recite mfr data verbatim and probably could implement in a safe way with effectiveness~ but it’s interesting to me how this and other ’necessary’ skills go unpracticed. I think I’ve probably set the system up on the ground or in another practice scenario~ but really can’t recall. From my memory~ I think I’ve had to lower a climber less than a handful of times and have been fortunate enough to to have coincidentally set the system with a Grigri or have used the carabiner ratchet method when required with an ATC. Thankfully to the latter setup~ none of these events were too memorable. Really appreciated seeing the LSD and hope I get a chance to implement and solidify that in my toolbelt/skillset. Lastly~ Connor~ your comment of thinking on your feet was so spot on and a good chuckle. I believe effective climbers are all too aware of their peers and fellow climbers who have achieved memorization of a system/the minimum necessary systems~ but in actuality have no/limited idea what they’re doing. It can be scary.  Thinking on your feet while considering the systems known and unknown to you~ immediate and objective dangers~ etc. is IMO a necessity of an effective climber.,Feb 2013,Apr 11 2020,1

Never test something you've never done before on your ""quarantine partner""~ you completely risked her life and created unneeded risk for her and for health workers in your county. At least you knew how to use a munter hitch... @Andy Wiesner~ you absolutely killed it with those photos of the guide ATC and reverso setups. This is a perfect example of why the guide ATC is superior. Obviously you need a backup on the brake strand~ i.e. a hollow block~ to catch the rope in the event of uncontrolled speeds. There are many methods of achieving this end result after a climber has fully weighted the device and you don't have enough gear to create a 3–1 to hoist them higher (or to a rest where they can unweight the rope).",Apr 2018,Apr 11 2020,3

You and a few others assumed it. I have lowered short distances with other devices (Pivot being one) in the same configuration~ several times. I had also rigged the Smart in guide mode and messed with it to see how lowering would work~ but never had the need to actually lower until now. There were some differences in the anchor configuration and angles between my practice and the real thing~ but that’s to be expected~ right? It was definitely less pleasant than the Pivot. You may have noticed that a bunch of other people in this thread have had similar experiences~ but sure~ I’m a dumbass.  3.

The crag is a 30min drive from my house and requires no interaction with others. It’s a 10min walk from the car to the climbing~ and it would take an extremely serious incident to require a rescue. I comfortably lead NC 5.8+ slab routes on gear and 5.10 slab on bolts~ a bolted 5.6 will probably not be the place I get hurt. Accidents happen~ but it was a pretty low-risk choice and I stand by it.

Here’s the thing about this virus: it spreads asymptomatically.  People aren’t getting tested unless they show symptoms~ which means there’s a lot (probably the majority of cases) that we don’t know about.  Now I’m not judging you for climbing during the quarantine - as others said~ it’s a cost-benefit analysis that perhaps works out in your favor~ but it’s a personal decision.  However~ if you are going to climb~ it has to be absolutely no risk/chance of an epic stuff (your decision to toprope later in the week was smart) because guess where those 20 people almost assuredly HAVE been in your area?  The hospital.,Jul 2014,Apr 12 2020,6

8924,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,6,10," +1 for Ted's comments. Jared~ you asked in the OP ""Did I do something wrong?""~ so I'll respond to your original question. I think #1 and 2 of Ted's post sums up my thinking. The first point is that you didn't know how to use the device. You wrote on this page that~ ""I had also rigged the Smart in guide mode and messed with it to see how lowering would work""~ but you hadn't rigged it properly~ so I don't understand what you mean by ""messed with it."" It seems to me that you didn't know enough about the device to use it properly. I think some of the more strongly worded comments here might have been more moderate if you had owned up to that. The second point speaks to my greater concern. As late as page 6 of this discussion you seem to be defensive about the whole experience. I may have missed where you wrote that you appreciated the danger in this situation~ but you seem to have written off genuine concern from others as ""misguided trashing"" (sure~ some of these posts are probably just that). Edit: You posted your comments~ above~ as I was writing this. You points #1 and 2 reinforce my sense that you are being defensive and not owning up. No~ you don't have to post your whole history of belaying~ or be able to see into the future. Admit you made a mistake and move on.

8932,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,6,18, Couple points: Practice with gear at home before using it. If you defeat a device have a third hand and redirect. You probably shouldn't be climbing~ but context is important. Regardless of said context~ most of us would prefer people stay at home. A friend of mine went climbing at a local crag fell and broke 6 ribs~ went to a San Diego hostipital. She's very scared she got exposed to covid and can't get a testing kit. It's not a big deal~ until it is. I have zero problem with anyone going climbing if they are taking precautions - it is a personal risk you are taking. Just be aware of the consequences. I rode my mountain bike the other day behind my house and cratered hard~ could have easily found myself in the same hospital as my friend. It's better to just talk openly about things and be objective and reasonable than to stand on a side of a fence and scream across the yard~ tho~ so there's that. edit - quick system of checks: Climber can unweight the rope - Load Strand Direct w/autobloc Climber cannot unweight the rope but are light or there is a lot of rope out - throw on autobloc~ dump device Climber cannot unweight and you can't dump - redirect a sling (or excess rope or whatever) from the smaller eyelet of the device (not applicable on the smart) up through a carabiner into your harness~ autbloc back up. Lean back and it will dump the device as your body weight cranks it out of position. Great thing about the smart is the leverage you get is good enough that the autobloc+dump method works almost always. Never had to do more than that with a Smart.

8947,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,7,13, Its likely been said but...  I once had a hard time lowering a climber projecting the last pitch.  The issue was the top rope was wedging (pinched) its self between the lower rope and the metal.  Once the system was unweighted it was easy to lower again.  The proposed solution was to use the smaller Smart since the metal gap is smaller and prevents the wedging.  (I might have gotten that tip from Tradiban so take it for whats its worth).,Jun 2016,Apr 14 2020,0

Simul-rapping and guide mode are more complicated~ more opportunities to fuck up~ and should only be done by more experienced climbers.

Just because there's a tool or technique that some people are more likely to mess up doesn't mean more experienced climbers who know the caveats shouldn't use them.

8954,I lowered someone in “guide mode” today,8,0," Belaying in ""guide mode"" is not complicated – just different. And there is no reason to pull people up the route either (though I have received that treatment many times myself - annoying!): simply use one hand on the climbing side to gently tension the line and feel the climber's movement. When enough slack is generated~ gently pull in some – but not all – of the slack~ leaving room for the climber to move (even down slightly) without yarding them up the rock. Lowering~ especially over long distances~ can be complicated~ but I wouldn't say proper techniques for this are any harder to learn learn than techniques to escape belays (which guide mode makes irrelevant – a plus one for that!)~ so it often depends on what your current skill set and proclivities are as a belayer. I often find that it's not so much the technique~ but the person. In my experience~ the majority of people are resistant to learning new/different techniques (whether they be improvements or equivalent to old ones). This just seems to be human nature. In these cases~ I'm more inclined to have the belayer belay in a style that is safe and comfortable for them rather than have them do something new and different (even though it's just as effective once mastered). Learning new belay and lowering techniques is more appropriate for on-ground practice sessions~ where it is safe to experiment without the repercussions of failure. When climbing with a new partner~ I will discuss belay systems so that I can understand where their skills are at and what they're comfortable doing~ whether it be ""old school"" or ""guide-approved"" is mostly irrelevant as long as it matches my expectations of safety. If it doesn't~ then I move on. I think this is the biggest cause of most belaying mishaps~ whether top-roping~ multi pitching or gym climbing. Assuming skills and experience that are not there~ or teaching new ones in the moment without time for mastery~ are sure ways to get injured or worse. Unfortunately as a guide and climbing gym instructor I've seen the wrong side of this in so many ways. I've seen several competent ATC belayers drop people on Grigris too... Stay safe~ be happy. Stay COVID-19 free.",Oct 2014,Apr 14 2020,2

I can't say I've shared your experience with the rock dust~ but most of my experience doing hard slab and face routes has been drilling from a hook~ so once the bolt's in and I'm clipped in it's pretty easy to reach down and brush things.

But after the shenanigans (hanging from the bolt~ etc.)~ I want the redpoint.   FWIW I do know a guy who put up some of the hardest slab climbs I've ever seen~ and in a lot of cases he'd drill off a stance~ clip the bolt and move on without ever weighting it.    ",Apr 2004,Apr 26 2020,2

I have a stash of the DMMs which have a nylon locking mechanism and are great all round carabiners. Unfortunately they are no longer made. That said for crease rescue I would just use std carabiners.

8999,sizing for moccasyms,1,2, They stretch quite a bit. I wear anywhere from an 8-9 street shoe~ depending on brand (8.5 nike running shoes as a good baseline). I've got two pairs of moccs. My first pair of 8.5 moccs were kinda loose at the start but have conformed to my feet well for a crack /all day shoe. my 7.5 moccs took forever to break in but now they are comfy and awesome. I couldn't get the 7.5 moccs on without a plastic bag for the first few days of solid climbing.  I also own a pair of La sportiva Genius in 41's (men's 8) that are just a touch too big.,Jun 2019,Apr 25 2020,1
9000,sizing for moccasyms,1,3, What do you want them for?  They’re a very versatile shoe that can be useful in a range of sizes. Same size as your Anasazi = comfy crack/all day shoe.  0.5-1 more sizes down = good gym/steep climbing shoe.  If you can tolerate 11.5 in Pinks they’ll probably be too loose in that size for hard climbing so I would aim for 11s.,Jul 2014,Apr 25 2020,0
9001,sizing for moccasyms,1,4, I go one size down from street  I’m street 11 and wear moccs and Pinks in 10.  Once my moccs stretch in they are quite comfortable~ but will get sloppy from sweat if I wear them for long periods. I let them dry out And they are fine again.  I know others like to downsize more aggressively but I’ve been climbing 19 years and my feet can’t take that abuse any more. I’ll wear something with more support like a pink or a stiffer scarpa for more demanding routes. ,Nov 2006,Apr 25 2020,2

If someone was price-conscious~ I'd recommend the addicts. Very comparable to the moccasyms and my feet don't look like I have flaming red athlete's foot every time I take them off ofter a long day with no socks. The addicts are discontinued and I've found them online in the last 3 months or so for around $70. Steph Davis wears them and she seems legit. ,Nov 2013,Apr 26 2020,0

9006,La Sportiva Solution Comp and Theory seem to be available in the stores but they are hard to get. Anyone here with some feedback?,1,0, Hi :) I have seen that you can already order the new Solution Comp and Theory from different online stores. They are either out of stock or only available in size elephant. Perhaps it is a bit early to ask for feedback because people need to break them in first to give a review. I just thought I try my luck here and see if anyone can say something about them~ mostly regarding the size and in comparison with the old Solution and other La Sportiva shoes.  I wore 3 pairs of Solution and changed to the Futuras last year. Both size 39.5EU. For me the Solution was a bit too stiff and the Futura is probably a bit too soft sometimes (heelhooks mostly)~ even though I really love my Futuras. How should I size them? How do they feel out of the box compared to the old Solution and the Futura? How does the Theory compare to the Skwama for example (lacing system seems equal)? Any information is greatly appreciated :) Greetings~ Tobi  ,Feb 2020,Feb 24 2020,0
9007,La Sportiva Solution Comp and Theory seem to be available in the stores but they are hard to get. Anyone here with some feedback?,1,1," I've been wearing the Solution Comp for about two weeks now. I ended up with the same size as the OG Solution (39.5). They do feel a bit lower volume at first~ but break in much more quickly because they are much softer. They actually feel very much like a Python or Skwama in the midsole~ but with Solution fit and performance (pointy toe). The rubber on top of the shoe is very thin~ soft~ and sticky. Toe hooking is great. My one big question mark is heel hooking performance. The heel is much lower volume than the OG Solution~ and it sits lower on my achilles. I haven't had a chance to pull hard on the heel yet~ but the fit is questionable for my foot shape. For reference the old molded heel fits me perfectly. I think these will now fill the role of my all around do everything shoe~ as they are a good middle ground between my OG Solutions and Dragos. As far as the Theory goes~ it's my understanding that they won't be released until mid May at the earliest. Maybe some places are doing pre-sale? I did get to try on a sample~ and for a super performance fit I would go a half size down from my Solutions (39). At that size it feels like a painted on rubber sock. For some more comfort the same size as the Solution would work. I don't think this one is going to stretch much~ since it is almost entirely rubber. The forefoot is a bit wider than the Solution~ it fits a bit more like the Futura~ but is much much softer. I really can't wait to climb in this one~ it is such a badass shoe. For reference I wear (performance fit) 39 Drago~ 39.5 Instinct VSR~ 38.5 Skwama~ 39.5 Solution~ 39.5 Solution Comp~ 38.5 old Python~ 8.5 Unparallel VIM. Half size up in each for ""comfy"".

I am street shoe size 42 and I can not imagine going down another full size. You are crazy :D So I will probably go for 39.5 in Solution and try the Theory in 39.5/39 to see what's better. I know that the Skwama works in 39 for me~ so one of these two sizes will fit :) Regarding the pre-sale~ I have seen them in the epic.tv shop and some other stores. I am from germany and I haven't seen them in the german online stores yet. I normally order my shoes from sportokay but they are not even listed there. Also interesting that you are also wearing the Dragos. La Sportiva fits me really well but the Scarpa Drago just didn't work out for me in any size imaginable.  ,Feb 2020,Feb 24 2020,0

9013,Offset Nuts!,1,0, I love my offset nuts~ rarely rack the regular ones. Have DMM HBs 7-11. For going smaller~ should I get peenuts or HB brassies? For sizing I'm assuming the brassies line up pretty nicely with largest being 6 and smallest alloy being 7. Or is the sizing different for whatever reason?,May 2018,Apr 23 2020,1
9014,Offset Nuts!,1,1, I have both peenuts and DMM brass offsets.  If the price difference doesn't bother you~ go for the brass.  The breaking strength is significantly higher in comparable sizes~ so they're much more confidence-inspiring for free climbing. I'm pretty sure the sizing doesn't line up between the two~ the brass #1 is a super-micro aid piece~ the #1 peenut is significantly bigger. I can post some size-comparison pics later,Oct 2017,Apr 23 2020,6

9019,Offset Nuts!,1,6, The head width difference is significant so I like having a set of each to give me more options.  Don't place them all that often but they weigh next to nothing.,Dec 2010,Apr 23 2020,0
9020,Offset Nuts!,1,7, The profile is different~ the most important difference being the peenuts have a more pronounced taper from top to bottom.  In my area (Tucson~ large-grain granite)~ the brass stick better~ especially the two bigger ones which can grab crystals in the gouges.  I feel like that ramp on the deeper side of the peenut (where the larger radius curve is) makes them want to spit out rather than stick. The best placements are the ones you can set wide side deep~ which probably accounts for 50% of my micro offset placements. The DMM offset family tree:,Oct 2017,Apr 24 2020,6
9021,Offset Nuts!,1,8, Those nuts all look new.  I’d go with PeeNuts because they’ll hold up better over a lot of climbing. They’re swaged not brazed~ so cables are likely to last longer. Getting out a stuck brassie can easily damage the cables. Plus the PeeNuts cost way less.  This is nothing against the brass. I have them too and they are wonderful~ but they generally stay in the bag unless a routemdescription calls for tiny gear.  YMMV,Nov 2006,Apr 24 2020,4
9022,Offset Nuts!,1,9, ,Oct 2017,Apr 24 2020,14
9023,Offset Nuts!,1,10, I have both Peenuts and the brassies. The brass suffers from greater attrition on my rack~ due to panic setting the nut~ and inability of my partners to clean them.  They cost too much for my tastes~ so I replaced with Peenuts as they disappeared form my rack.  If you fall on one~ they are pretty much going to be fixed. Even using one in an weighted anchor will tend to deform them a little bit.,Jul 2015,Apr 24 2020,0

Im sure you could fasten the tube to the plate with bolts but it would be flexy. At any rate get/make the smaller size.....like 1.25"". My early attempts were on larger diameter tube. They worked as intended but it tended to ""hang"" on the flesh just inside the crease of the joint. Not only did it hurt but it felt like aid.

If I remember right~ the Impreza is a bit longer than the Fit~ but I don't think you can comfortably sleep in either. I'm 5'10""~ and despite trying to rig something several times in the Impreza~ I've  always ended up disappointed and sleep deprived. The seats don't fold down perfectly flat~ and I had to position my head between the 2 front seats to be able to stretch my legs out. Not really worth the time or effort unless it's an emergency or you build out a more permanent platform~ IMO.  4. I don't remember noise to be a problem in either~ but the Impreza definitely drives and handles much nicer than the Fit. That was a main selling point actually. We were leaning towards the Fit~ but immediately took it off the list after the test drive.  5. The clearance sucks on both vehicles~ but I've been stuck on a dirt road in the Fit~ whereas the Impreza has yet to let me down. I'd look at something higher clearance over AWD/4WD if rough roads are an issue where you live. The AWD on the Subaru is nice on slick roads though.  I don't remember what year range the head gasket problem was for certain models of Subarus~ and I don't think it applied to the Impreza~ but the problem was addressed a long time ago. ",Mar 2006,Apr 25 2020,2
9061,Honda fit vs Subaru impreza,1,11, On paper the impreza has more cargo.  Is the space in the fit more practically used then? Weird~ I had to double check. The Impreza seems much smaller in use vs the Fit. I think in real world use the Fit destroys an Impreza in utilizing the space. ,Oct 2010,Apr 25 2020,0

9069,Honda fit vs Subaru impreza,1,19, We’ve been beating on our Fit for 8 years and the thing is a beast. It’s been to Burning Man 3 times~ driven cross country some 16+ times~ I’m constantly driving it through the mountains and Moab~ town driving every day for our business~ at least one day a week of driving on dirt roads in the mountains. The most we’ve had to do with it outside of normal maintenance is a $250 fix on something small. I’m 5’7” and sleeping in the back is fine~ but just a bit too short to be comfortable. If you’re taller than me~ I’d imagine it’d be pretty awful unless you’re a fetal position sleeper. Overall I would buy another fit in a heartbeat. Gas mileage is great and I never really want for anything more.,Apr 2016,Apr 25 2020,1

9074,Honda fit vs Subaru impreza,2,3, I couldn't fit my snowboard in a Honda Fit~ had to drop the passenger seat to have enough length. If you know how to handle it~ the Impreza AWD is really nice~ especially if you drive in snow.,Nov 2006,Apr 25 2020,0
9075,Honda fit vs Subaru impreza,2,4, Test drove the 17' crosstrek which is identical to the Impreza in the newer iteration~ less height/style: also taken many a trip in a friends Fit. Assuming we're talking about the hatch impreza- I'd say the Subaru felt more spacious~ if nothing because of the length. When you compare dimensions this is pretty significant. The height in the fit is concentrated better for people and normal sized gear cramming (if that makes sense); if you ever need a surfboard~ tall person~ snowboard etc~ you'd probably like the impreza more. I ended up going with a 2017 Forester for the 2.5L with more pep as someone echoed earlier fwiw. Can't go wrong here though,Oct 2019,Apr 25 2020,0

9077,Honda fit vs Subaru impreza,2,6, Old subies are a terrible option~ the engine tolerances were too tight for how light the engines were built~ and due to the width of the engine they cant be beefed up anymore~ this is why porsche never put a boxer in the front of their cars. This led to headgasket failure~ ringland faliure~ and poor fuel economy. Newer models have loosened up engine tolerances which helps prevent (but not eliminate) those problems. However they are still prone to oil consumption~ cracked blocks~ worn rod bearings~ thrown rods~ and oil leaks that seem to come from thin air. Also because of the engine layout~ they are a royal pain in the ass because for many basic repairs the engine has to come out of the car. Just get the honda~ or anything else for that matter. TL;DR  Dont buy a subaru unless you are a somewhat competent mechanic~ or have very deep pockets,Jan 2017,Apr 25 2020,1

9085,Storing rope in heat,1,6, I have heard that acids and acid fumes are something that can seriously weaken nylon.  I'd worry more about the car battery's location relative to the rope~ especially when the car gets hot and more battery off-gassing might occur or when it is running and the battery is charging and thus off-gassing. Car batteries are often located in the trunk or under the back seat in modern cars. Its in the trunk in my car so I try not to carry ropes/gear in the trunk.  I probably worry too much but I think there is some logic to this. thebmc.co.uk/ropes-dont-lik…blackdiamondequipment.com/e…;utm_medium=email&utm_source=hotwire-06182013,Nov 2016,Apr 24 2020,0

9088,Storing rope in heat,1,9, Occasional hot-car exposure is not going to do harm to your ropes. Van dwellers leave their ropes in the car~ because there is no other place to keep them. You don’t hear of all the accidents that occur to van dwellers due to their ropes being compromised by storage in the car. And your car seat belts are still fine~ aren’t they? But why do it~ if you don’t have to? Is it really so hard to bring your gear inside? The shoe rubber is more likely to suffer in a hot car than a rope. ,Mar 2011,Apr 25 2020,1

9092,Ideal climbing camera?,1,0," Hi. I have been looking for a good camera for climbing over the years and have been very frustrated. Most ""waterproof"" cameras like the Olympus TG-1-6 or Nikon AW1 are made of lead (I think  Japanese manufacturers can't imagine someone using a waterproof cameras unless they're snorkeling in Hawaii). All phones take crappy photos at dusk and are made of eggshell porcelain. All waterproof cameras I've seen which aren't made of lead can't take a dusk shot~ either. The best one I've used thus fat is the Sony TX5~ a camera that is over 10 years old and at 142 grams is about what I'd consider the limit weight-wise for my uses. Is there anything better out there?",Mar 2018,Apr 17 2020,0
9093,Ideal climbing camera?,1,1, My most recent climbing camera was a FujiFilm FinePix F80 EXR. Supposedly it will take decent photos in low light~ but in dim enough light even a $3000 camera won't take nice photos. I never looked for a waterproof camera. I live in California and I'm a rock climber. If the weather looks sketchy and I'm climbing anyway~ I take a ziplock bag~ and my camera goes in there if it starts to rain.,Jan 2007,Apr 17 2020,1
9094,Ideal climbing camera?,1,2, I moonlight as a wedding photographer~ with the closet full of expensive gear to prove it. My iPhone 11 is capable of 75% of what my full-frame DSLR can do~ including low light.  The ideal climbing camera is the one you can carry easily. ,Oct 2017,Apr 17 2020,21
9095,Ideal climbing camera?,1,3," This.  I own a nice DSLR and at one point had a large sensor point and shoot as well.  They're both a PITA to bring with you unless you're REALLY dedicated to the craft and more often than not I didn't have them with me.  Never mind the frustration with having to tinker with settings and exposure etc.  I shot Weddings for a while and know at least a bit of the craft.  For climbing I want the absolute dead easiest thing to pull out~ snap and put away.  Modern smart phones are  close and on many levels~ better.  It's been my exclusive camera on my last two big trips (lifetime highlights) and I had ZERO regrets only having the iPhone.  I'm not submitting to NatGeo or the Patagonia Catalog mind you...  I carry my phone in a padded ""pouch"" that rides on a chalk bag belt.  It's easily accessible and secure.    Some examples -   ",Jun 2006,Apr 17 2020,13

9101,Ideal climbing camera?,1,9, They make some high-end point and shoot cameras with decent resolution like the Canon G15.  Nikon and Fuji~ etc. make models with similar features.  The problem with a phone is resolution.  They are fine if you are only going to display your photos on the web.  If you enlarge them at all they fall apart.  For example~ the resolution of an iPhone 7 is 750 x 1334 pixels.   A Canon G15 is 3000 x 4000.  ,Sep 2001,Apr 17 2020,0
9102,Ideal climbing camera?,1,10, iPhone 7 is 12MP or 3000x4000  Same as my iPhone 8 and the G15.  Sensor size will matter as will the heavy handed processing in most phones but for most~ not enough to offset the cumbersome issues.  YMMV,Jun 2006,Apr 17 2020,2
9103,Ideal climbing camera?,1,11," The newer phone cameras have really made point and shoot cameras obsolete. With a good DSLR/mirrorless you can still get better shots than even a high-end phone~  but you have to know how to use it and put in some effort.

9104,Ideal climbing camera?,1,12, I love my Sony RX100. I have owned the version 2 and currently have the 4. You can find them used on Adorama or a similar site for a few hundred.

9105,Ideal climbing camera?,1,13, I also have a RX100 mark III and it takes much better pictures than an iPhone. However~ I have a lot more iPhone pictures from climbing because it's always with me...,Mar 2015,Apr 17 2020,3
9106,Ideal climbing camera?,1,14, Are you trying to shoot raw? Are you editing in lightroom etc? Are you okay with lugging multiple lenses and spending a crap-load on glass? Then you should look into DSLR's and learning how to use/edit with one....very worth it when you use them correctly and know how to edit.  it seems like that is the opposite of what you are looking for~ in which case a modern phone with a waterproof case is by far the most logical~ and honestly best option. Iphone 11~ Galaxy s20 and pixel4 all have pretty insane cameras. I have a pixel 3 and I'm extremely impressed with the quality of photos that it takes. I don't really see an argument to use a point and shoot camera over one of these phones~ as they are just another piece of gear to carry with you and are usually outperformed by the phone.  What phone do you currently have that is shooting so bad? It might not be a bad time for an upgrade. ,May 2015,Apr 17 2020,0
9107,Ideal climbing camera?,1,15, What do you want to do with your photos? Upload to the web for social media? Get a newish smartphone then. However~ if you want to print or view pictures on big screens~ no smartphones even come close to an entry level DSLR from 10 years ago. Physical sensor size and lens quality will always be the dominant factor in image quality~ something obviously compromised in phones. That said~ look at the Lumix LX100 or RX100. Both have great (fixed) lenses and are super small (maybe a half liter?). I've taken my LX100 on many trips and am always glad to have higher quality images of certain vistas (I like to print photos). For me a small point and shoot is definitely worth chucking in the bag. It just depends what your use case is.,Jan 2016,Apr 17 2020,0
9108,Ideal climbing camera?,1,16, Ditto for the RX100.  I have a Mark 7 and the one-tenth second autofocus capability is invaluable for those one-handed action shots.  Unfortunately~ it's very pricey.  The older models have come down in price a lot though as others have mentioned.,Aug 2008,Apr 17 2020,1
9109,Ideal climbing camera?,1,17, I have a Fuji Xt3 and love it. It comes with one of the best free lenses on the market. Picked it up on B&H I believe.  Having the better free lenses made my decision easier when comparing it to the Sony A7iii. If you want to upgrade to a zoom lens in the future~ then Fuji is the way to go.,May 2016,Apr 17 2020,1

9117,Ideal climbing camera?,2,4, That's the resolution of the phone's screen~ not of the camera sensor. You are absolutely correct.  My mistake.  However~ when I bring an iPhone 7/8~ etc. photo into PhotoShop and try to enlarge it the image falls apart (pixelated).  If I do that with a camera like my Canon G15 it can be enlarged with no problem.  It may have to do with the tiny lens on the phone versus a much bigger lens on the camera.  Just like my old Nikon D80 DSLR (10MP) takes better photos that can be enlarged much more than my 12MP point and shoot or any phone.,Sep 2001,Apr 18 2020,0
9118,Ideal climbing camera?,2,5, How useful is the iPhone 11 Pro's wide/ultra-wide lenses in climbing photography? Not trying to be the next Ansel Adams so I'm content with a phone camera. It's just that I often wish I could get a wider field of view~ like at a tight belay and being able to capture my partner plus the surrounding rock and more sky. My current photos just look like portraits~ whereas I'd like a picture that captures a scene or shows the journey. Now that the SE 2 has been announced~ the wide angle lenses are the only deciding factor for me. It seems like the wide angle lenses might be better at showing steepness~ but I'm not sure.,Sep 2014,Apr 22 2020,0
9119,Ideal climbing camera?,2,6, I got an 11 for that very reason. I used to carry a Moment wide-angle auxiliary lens~ and it definitely helps with some shots~ but like any other lens you have to use it in the right circumstances. ,Oct 2017,Apr 22 2020,1
9120,Ideal climbing camera?,2,7, I still bring my 10 year old Panasonic DMC-ZS5 along because it's easier to shoot one handed even though my iphone 8 seems to take better pics.  I guess that's because I still don't really know what I'm doing.,Dec 2010,Apr 22 2020,0

9123,Ideal climbing camera?,2,10, That's fair. My biggest gripe with the phone is the fact that you need a second hand to tap on the screen for focus~ exposure~ etc. ,Oct 2017,Apr 22 2020,1
9124,Ideal climbing camera?,2,11, The main ability a real camera has over phones~ is the lens. Being able to zoom provides a lot more composing opportunities and is needed if you want to shoot any wildlife. (My current Sony HX80 has a 30x zoom and pop-up viewfinder in the smallest size at the time.) Otherwise the modern phones are great. My current $150 phone is just okay~ but I will likely get a Pixel 4a when it goes on sale (as in not MSRP - black friday maybe). Currently I leave the phone in the car or backpack unless I really need some beta and don't have a photocopied topo. Camera case is clipped to harness.  I wouldn't want my phone to have a 'biner clip 100% of the time~ so that would be annoying possibly~ too. Two cases - one for home~ one for trips~ I guess...?  Just thinking out loud here. Will definitely revisit when I get a new phone with a much better camera. ,Oct 2010,Apr 22 2020,2

Bought i used on ebay and likely made nearly all my $ back when I sold it. I also tried the Panny ZS100 - another 1"" sensor with a bit more zoom.

9134,Ideal climbing camera?,3,1, So you trust the lanyard that came with the case eh? hmmm...i'm not so sure. maybe if i could back it up somehow. The nite ize lanyard might be the right companion? Yes~ because it’s a sealed case with both sides locked together and the camera completely enclosed.    I personally feel the lanyard attachment point is as substantial enough relative to its size.  I had a very similar wrist strap and attachment point on my Canon G7x as well as my Fuji waterproof camera.   Given the weight of the phone/case combo(240g) I think it’s not very likely to break under normal use unless you were to have some extreme abrasion right at the thinnest point of the lanyard.  Other people might disagree.  If you really wanted to you could easily thread another lanyard or make a backup lanyard out of some extremely thin dyneema cord.  If you wanted to back up the attachment point itself~ I could think of a few ways to reenforce it.  Just my two cents. ,Oct 2016,Apr 24 2020,1
9135,Micro Cams,1,0, With all the different flexible stem small cams on the market~ what’s your opinion on the best small cams? If you have used more than one type~ which did you prefer and why? Every time I see C3’s show up on this form~ they get picked up quickly~ but i have heard some say they prefer the X4’s to them. With the new Z4’s out~ are they better? I have also heard people who swear to the aliens~ and the dragonfly’s~ and who can forget~ the black totem. What’s your take?,Jan 2019,Apr 24 2020,0
9136,Micro Cams,1,1, I only have experience with X4s and Z4s~ and Z4 > X4,Oct 2017,Apr 24 2020,1
9137,Micro Cams,1,2, C3's are my favorite~ hands down! Biggest down side is that they only go up to roughly .3. Their narrow head width and asymmetric lobes make them a dream for tight/awkward placements~ especially pin scars. They can also take a beating. X4's are my next pick. Their heads are also very narrow but since they have 4 lobes they require cracks that are more even and parallel to sit properly. Super tough construction as well. I like the Z4's but not the three smallest sizes (0 - .2). The trigger action is too tight. I also feel like the construction of the Z4's isn't as burly as the X4's or C3's. I really dig the lobe geometry and material of the Z4's though. They get just a tiny bit smaller than X4's because the top of the lobes are flat and this is actually quite useful. Time will tell if this makes the smaller sizes weaker.,Jun 2016,Apr 24 2020,1
9138,Micro Cams,1,3, i consider micro cams to be smaller than the black totem. maybe people use totems or c4s from blue and have something else to supplement the rack with smaller gear (any of the cams you have named or slider nuts~ etc). ,Aug 2013,Apr 24 2020,2
9139,Micro Cams,1,4," A lot of it depends on where you're climbing. C3s are fantastic~ due to their very narrow head-width~ when it comes to some placements. Aliens are the way to go at the Gunks~ where horizontals are the primary placement. C3s in horizontals~ while they will hold the fall~ do not do well. X4s are nice but are not as ""sticky"" as aliens due to a different type of aluminum used in their lobes. They also don't tend to fit as well as aliens in pin scars (think typical Yosemite cracks). I haven't played with the Z4s yet. Mastercams are nice but are not as sticky as aliens. The Ultralight Mastercams were a step backward for Metolius (due to getting rid of the thump loop) and remain the dumbest move I've ever seen a climbing gear manufacturer make. Of course~ just buy Totems and you're basically set for everything. Or at least that seems to be the generally accepted opinion on here (and Totems ARE a fantastic cam).",Aug 2008,Apr 24 2020,1
9140,Micro Cams,1,5, I think I've used most micro cams out there. Currently I really like my Z4's. The head width is the same as C3's (which i also have). Given that~ the 4 lobed cam should have more holding power. However~ my black and blue totems are my favorite cams. If only they made a .1ish size. I really never liked the X4's~ sure they worked~ but were really floppy when trying to smash into a tight placement. The lobe material was really slippery too. Z4's are a definite improvement. ,Jul 2014,Apr 24 2020,0

I disagree with the statement that the UL Mastercams where a step backwards.  Everyone I've heard say that doesn't actually own any they just dislike the idea of them.  In practice the stem is so fat I dont notice and tend to palm the stem anyway  X4s where my first small cams and I thought they were good until I tried other cams long enough to get used to the sizes.,Apr 2015,Apr 24 2020,0

9147,Micro Cams,1,12, I have no micro cams~ I need to get some micro cams. After reading every damn thread over the last few months of all these new micros coming out my conclusion is wild country are probably making the best micro cams out there at the moment~ that being said its all super super fucking close in terms of head width and overall reception non too flexible non too stiff~ the only outligher is the dragon fly being noticeably wider than every other micro (maybe better for sandstone?).  So really you could pick just about any of the new cams that have come out in the last 6 months and be thrilled with them~ but you would probably have a better time with the wild country cam. This is of course in reference to every size bellow black totems~ if you want a black totem sized cam the best cam is a black totem. ,Oct 2015,Apr 24 2020,0
9148,Micro Cams,1,13, Same.  I have a mix of UL Mastercams~ aliens~ one X4~ and a black totem.  The soft lobes on the aliens stick better~ but the mastercams cost less and are holding up better.  I'd get a set of UL Mastercams + one black totem~ myself.,Sep 2018,Apr 24 2020,0
9149,Micro Cams,1,14, I'm in the same boat as you Seb. Been delaying basically since the Dragonfly's were announced. Then the Z4s were announced. I've used C3's the most with friends and really liked them. Only other small cam I've used is an X4 like twice. Did not like it. Friend has a rack of UL mastercams~ and yes~ I know I want a thumb loop. I'm surprised I haven't dropped one of his cams yet...,Nov 2015,Apr 24 2020,0

Aka Team  Dragon  I did fugure out the vim is the V10 slipper which i missed.  Any shops where you know they carry these?

9166,Unparlle shoes... fit consistancy~ thoughts likes dislikes?,1,2, Sizing was pretty consistent across the boards. I was able to try almost every shoe on a couple months back. I ended up grabbing the regulus~ vim and moc. Couldn't be happier the VIM is my favorite hands down. The rubber is good nice and sticky. Shoes molded but didn't stretch out. Not exactly apples to apples 5.10. For me at least was all the things I liked but with some tweaks that fixed what I didn't like mostly. Solid build in particular the straps both pull on and across foot. I measure a 12 on a brannock device. Wore 11 Hi Angle (tight)~ 11.5 Arrowhead(sport climb tight~ 11 to boulder)~ 12 old Dragon (really tight)~ 11.5 black teams (tight).  UP Vim 11.5  tight but never painful (could go to 11 but heel didn't sit right. 11.5 with out stretching has been perfect) 11 regulus (tight but never painful) fits really similar to Hi Angle. Everything else I tried on I was an 11.5. and seemed perfect. Heels are hard to pull on especially the VIM but not that bad.,Oct 2010,Apr 24 2020,1

9169,Unparlle shoes... fit consistancy~ thoughts likes dislikes?,1,5, I’ve had the up mocs for a while now and i love ‘em. I downsized them to be uncomfortably tight in store~ (bought them at sage to summit in bishop) but now they fit like a snug glove. I can keep them on for an hour or more~ but theyre tight enough so the heel doesnt pop out on heel hooks. Compared to some 5.10 mocs i had i think the upmocs seem like much better quality. I’ve scoped the up pinks in person and they’re very sexy~ and seem higher quality than 5.10 pinks.   i am glad the up mocs dont stain my feet red. They stain your feet a strange yellow for a week or so~ but it’s hardly noticeable compared to the red from the 5.10s.  The up rubber is sticky as hell~ and i wish i could get some more. They’ve been resoled once with xs grip rubber~ which is pretty damn sticky itself~ and they’ll need another soon. Got ‘em resoled at the rubber room~ and they didnt stretch them at all. Still fit like a glove. ,Jun 2018,Apr 24 2020,2
9170,Unparlle shoes... fit consistancy~ thoughts likes dislikes?,1,6, Sizing:  perfectly consistent.  I had trouble determining my size at first~ and due to that and our packs getting stolen~ I went through a few pairs last fall.  They were all smack-on consistent in terms of size.  Once I'd gotten my size figured out (I was always 7.5 in 5.10~ that is until their sizing went bonkers;  I am a 7 in UP shoes~ probably due to the less aggro heel)~ I ordered a different shoe model in 7 without ever trying it on~ and it fit perfectly as predicted.   Model:  it's been a while since I climbed for real~ but .... I was really liking the UP lace~ which felt like a Miura?  It's on the stiffer end of shoes~ which is what I was looking for.  I was an Anasazi Velcro wearer for many years and pairs~ and so the second pair of UP I ordered was the Up Rise.  They're a touch stiffer than the Anasazi~ but so far I loved them~ the precision was great.  They didn't stretch much~ but the fit shifted around to meld with my foot in a really pleasing way. Overall~ I'm super impressed with the shoe quality.  Rubber is great~ seems a lot like stealth. All the fitting I did was at Climb On in Squamish.  ,Apr 2007,Apr 24 2020,2

I through personal experience working on boats have a hard time 100% trusting bowlines. Tying up to mooring cans and not having a spliced end to throw over the bit on the boat~ I would sometimes use a bowline to hold our 66 ton boat. Two times~ a knot that I would tie day in and day out somehow came untied during the middle of the night and our boat would be drifting.

9188,Advice on beginning a trad rack?,1,4, I agree with the hexes~ they are great and cheap to leave behind when you need to bail.   Don't get drawn in to buying cheap cams~ you will only end up buying better later on and will have waisted that money.  You will be happy with Wild Country~ Metolius~ BD.  As far as nuts go I really like off set nuts~ I never use regular nuts and don't even bother racking them anymore~ Ive never been shut down placing an off set nut but there were plenty of times I had regular nuts and wish I had an off set.   Small cams are more useful than large~ you can sometimes fit a small cam in the back of a large crack but you can NEVER fit a large cam in a small crack.  ,Apr 2012,Apr 22 2020,6

9191,Advice on beginning a trad rack?,1,7, i slowly bought a trad rack over a year and a half period and just started using it over the past few months. i got nuts (just a normal set of dmm) and hexes (also dmm~ the extendable ones). i have a full set of totems~ i have some alien revos~ for bigger pieces i have bd cams. when i would order cams i would order slings or carabiners usually to get to whatever free shipping was. that helped me build a set of alpine draws and soft goods. i never paid full price for anything (thank you to the many people on MP that i've bought and sold with over the years~ and thanks to the homies that got me deals on gear). just from my personal expierience when im climbing im reaching for the totem cams first~ then other cams~ then hexes~ then nuts. i started building a double rack of cams the first time i really wanted to use the same size piece again but couldnt. i want to get better at passive placements so i usually bring that stuff with me and try to use both. oh yeah~ and i bought a pink tricam~ tricams are dope.,May 2014,Apr 22 2020,1
9192,Advice on beginning a trad rack?,1,8, Hexes just get left behind once you have a set of doubles or more. My advice is buy once cry once instead of buying stuff you won't use later on. Any granite with pin scars or flares (valley and maybe LCC) totems are heaven but pricy.  I would pick up a set of used BD cams if you are price conscious. You can pick them up in the for sale section of MP for about 35$ a cam. Nuts are also super cheap used~ can probably pick up a set for 40$. Wait for a sale for biners for alpines.

9209,Can pull testing weaken a carabiner?,1,4, Aluminum is pretty brittle in terms of metals so it won't neck very much. To answer OPs question:,Dec 2017,Apr 20 2020,3
9210,Can pull testing weaken a carabiner?,1,5, It's really hard to say and results can be unpredictable. You won't be able to reliably weaken a carabiner by pull testing it once. A single high load on a carabiner unpredictably effects fatigue stress~ it could actually make the carabiner stronger. In this study they repeatedly loaded 23 kN carabiners to 6 kN until they broke. For a brand new carabiner~ it took 16000 loadings before failing at 6 kN. Then on one of the carabiners they loaded it to 17 kN once then repeated the same test and found it took 34000 loadings to 6 kN before failing. They speculate the reason for this is that the higher initially loading changed how much the carabiner flexes during the smaller loads and reduced the amount of fatigue each cyclic load imparted. I doubt this would be the case for every carabiner~ and there are probably some that are weakened.,Jun 2019,Apr 20 2020,13
9211,Can pull testing weaken a carabiner?,1,6, That's a really interesting case and I hadn't considered how it may see less strain because of work hardening. Thanks for the info! ,Dec 2017,Apr 20 2020,0
9212,Can pull testing weaken a carabiner?,1,7, To the op question~ it depends~ if you are loading it many times at high load probably yes . If it's the second cycle and you're pulling slowly and the gate is still holding properly~ probably not. Also~ I wouldn't consider aluminum brittle (12% if I remember correctly). Sure it's not OF copper but compared to gray irons it does really well. Not trying to argue with you Connor~ but I do want to point out that your post somewhat argues with itself. The more brittle a material the more likely it can approach failure with no permanent deformation.   If I'm remembering the curve accurately 6061-T6 shows a fairly simple stress stain curve and will technically get stronger until it breaks. However~ a carabiner isn't a dogbone. The issue you run into is that as it plastically deforms I would guess your gate action suffers long before breaking. The coolest thing about tensile testing to me is that on the second test (assuming the sample didn't shift) there would be zero plastic deformation until the same true stress is achieved.,Dec 2013,Apr 20 2020,8

9215,Can pull testing weaken a carabiner?,1,10," At what point is failure when testing a carabiner?  In civil we tend to consider any plastic deformation as ""failure"" that being said you can still continue to load until the ultimate yield strength.

9220,Can pull testing weaken a carabiner?,1,15, Something similar happens with aluminum as this steel graph shows. I believe what Connor means when he says it gets more brittle is that in the proposed scenario~ work hardening of aluminum will make it so that the new yield stress is up near the UTS. So it ends up snapping without much strain (% it bends compared to its initial~ deformed state). If you've ever tried to fix a bent bike brake lever~ this is why it snaps when you bend it back. To answer the initial question: would you pull test until it's deformed but not broken~ then pull again and have it fail at a lower UTS? Assuming it's a ring of aluminum (I don't know how the gate affects things)~ I'm guessing not. If it deforms so much that the gate isn't seated~ it'll fail much sooner since it adds a lot of strength. Basically I agree with Mike.,Nov 2012,Apr 21 2020,2

Omega Pacific (rip) was the only company that said so on their website. Every statement I've seen that mentions proofloading says its to half the MBS.

It's really not something worth worrying about~ but a 24 kN carabiner will only survive a few hundred cycles to 20 kN. In my mind~ a carabiner loaded to more than half its MBS is donezo. In all actuality~ having a cycle of very high stress (like 20 kN load on a 24kN biner) on a biner that is already fatiguing will significantly improve its fatigue life as the yielded material around the crack tip will provide a compressive force at the crack tip significantly reducing further crack growth.  Since aluminum has no endurance limit (it can be argued that no metal does)~ every load you put on a biner is eating into its fatigue life~ luckily~ at the loads we typically see in climbing~ that fatigue life is in the millions of cycles range~ so it isn't much of a worry.,Aug 2010,Apr 23 2020,1

9252,Best lightweight 60m rope,1,1," If weight is your criteria~ then weigh the ropes (and  by that I mean the actual weight of 60m in the bag~ not the ""g/m"" x 60m measured by the manufacturer)...don't go by diameter.  You'll probably find that a 9.0mm or a 9.1mm weighs about the same as a 8.7 or 8.9mm. For weighing ropes one of those hand-held electronic scales they sell for weighing luggage (0 - 75 lbs to the nearest 0.1 lb) works pretty well~ along with some cord so you can weigh it still in the bag.  As for ""how skinny""?  Depends on what you might be doing:  Short roped~ simlu climbing along a ridge where one person might have to jump of the :other side""...you want to do this with a 8.7mm???  But on snow followed by easy ice and a bit of rock...sure thing....maybe even an 8.0 or 8.3 ""half rope"".  The 9.0 / 9.2's are a pretty good compromise.   Another question: do you really need 60m?  If a 50m works~ you can save lbs and $$$'s. ",Aug 2013,Sep 29 2019,2

9262,Best lightweight 60m rope,1,11," Appreciate all the input so far! I will check out all the ropes mentioned. To answer a few questions - Robert Hall - Maybe I should say ""backcountry"" rather than ""alpine"". No ice or glacier travel~ no simul-climbing unless the terrain is dead easy~ nothing too crazy. Just your basic long multi-pitch where there's enough mileage on the approach and descent that rope weight matters. One climb I'm prepping for is Snake Dike - low chance of rope cutting~ low chance of falling~ but if I do fall it could be a long scary ride. Nick Drake - interesting discussion of sheath vs. core. Thanks for that. Climber Pat~ thanks for the reminder to check the specs on my belay devices. I carry an ATC guide and add an ATC pilot if my partner will be leading. (Yes~ carrying two devices is extra weight~ but not much~ and I like the extra security of the assisted braking on the Pilot for my leader). The guide can handle down to 7.7mm. The pilot is good to 8.7mm~ so that's probably the lowest I will go for my next rope purchase. In general - Not willing to do 50m because that's just not useful in enough situations anymore.

I've caught quite a few falls on one strand of 7.5-8mm half rope and done single strand raps just fine.  You are right a second carabineer works fine.  I just don't see people belaying with a second carabineer when they should.  It is easier to point them to the right tool that they are likely to use correctly.  ,Feb 2006,Sep 30 2019,0

The cut resistance looks like an important innovation for the kind of wandering trad I like.  This comparison review was helpful too. https://blacksheepadventuresports.com/2018/10/13/comparison-review-sub-9mm-climbing-ropes/ It was done before the Swift Protect was available~ but the chart is quite handy for comparing specs with other lightweight single ropes.

9292,Mini wire failing...,1,0, Has anyone had issues with BD miniwires carabiners? I took a short fall yesterday (at a small cliff about a 15 minute bike ride from my house) with a cam in a horizontal. The cam was sunk into the horizontal~ so I extended it~ and I just this racking bineer was positioned inter the sling I extended with. When I fell it must have mashed against a crystal and bent the gate around the nose. As I just replaced all of my racking bineers this is kind of concerning~ has anyone else had this issue? They seem very flexible~ as I was able to twist the carabineer by hand to get the gate back around. I'll post a picture when I'm not on my phone... ​​Pic​​​,Feb 2015,Apr 23 2020,3
9293,Mini wire failing...,1,1, Figured out how to add pictures!,Feb 2015,Apr 23 2020,1

9295,Mini wire failing...,1,3, Yeah I did last night~ just thought I would see if anyone else has had this happen,Feb 2015,Apr 23 2020,1
9296,Mini wire failing...,1,4, Were you able to twist the carabiner back to the gate or the gate back to the carabiner? Most likely the latter. If that is the case this does not seem like cause for concern. High forces pushing sideways directly on the wire gate can definitely cause that to happen. Seen it with Hotwires and Neutrinos~ no reason to think it would be different with these. ,Sep 2013,Apr 23 2020,3
9297,Mini wire failing...,1,5, I looks like the carabiner was levered against the rock.  You are lucky it did not break.,Feb 2006,Apr 23 2020,8
9298,Mini wire failing...,1,6, See that's the thing~ I was expecting the gate to bend~ but the actual carabineer seems to flex more than the gate.,Feb 2015,Apr 23 2020,0
9299,Mini wire failing...,1,7, I think it was pinched between the rock and the extended sling. It wasn't over an edge. And yeah~ luckily I clipped an alpine draw directly to the cam so this want loaded or it would likely have broken. ,Feb 2015,Apr 23 2020,1
9300,Mini wire failing...,1,8, Are you saying that you extended the placement with an alpine draw and did not clip into the racking carabiner on the cam? And that the racking carabiner on the cam was sandwiched between the rock and the carabiner on the alpine draw? ,Apr 2017,Apr 23 2020,2
9301,Mini wire failing...,1,9, I have heard anecdotally that wire gates are actually the most robust part because they are steel. Someone smart can confirm. Steel is real!,Jan 2011,Apr 23 2020,2
9302,Mini wire failing...,1,10, yep! ,Feb 2015,Apr 23 2020,1
9303,Mini wire failing...,1,11, Ok... with a cam buried so far back in a pebbly horizontal~ another approach would be to basket hitch the thumb loop on the cam with a double length runner. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with your carabiner that twisted open~ just a freak occurrence... ,Apr 2017,Apr 23 2020,1
9304,Mini wire failing...,1,12, Alex~ strange stuff happens climbing - it's not a laboratory environment. I too have seen gates (wire and solid) dislocated like yours on various popular 'biners including Neutrinos & SPIRITS. Unless it started happening frequently I would say this one-off occurrence is nothing to be alarmed by but thanks for posting about it.,Jun 2001,Apr 23 2020,1
9305,Mini wire failing...,1,13, When you got the gate back in place was there any major deformation? How was the gate action? It is true that the gates are steel and the carabiner body is aluminum..,Sep 2013,Apr 23 2020,0
9306,Mini wire failing...,1,14, I'm speculating that the weighed sling loaded across the gate of the non-loaded racking biner.  Not surprised it popped the gate.  You can push the wires on most wire gates sideways with your hands.   I wouldn't worry about the rest of your biners,Nov 2006,Apr 23 2020,0
9307,Mini wire failing...,1,15, Yep~ the price of ever lighter and thinner cross sections is bending~ relearning the lessons of the BD Fin. The gate doesn’t bend with the body due to the differences between steel and aluminum~ pretty common failure mode for ultralight carabiners loaded horizontally.  I grabbed a few as racking carabiners recently but noted as I put them on that I’d only be using them to clip to my harness or very clean~ vertical placements in the desert.  TL:DR Light~ Cheap~ Strong~ pick 2. ,Jun 2006,Apr 23 2020,1

9309,Mini wire failing...,1,17, Smallest~ lightest carabiner I will use is the Phantom/Chimera size.  Both are stupid strong for such a small carabiner~ and still big enough for my arthritic fingers to clip. ,Jul 2015,Apr 23 2020,0
9310,Mini wire failing...,1,18, Rock rubbing the wiregate open is one of the reasons I liked the hooded wire gate of the BD Oz carabiners.  I'm really sad they discontinued them~ amd hope BD comes out with an actual replacement for the Oz soon.,Oct 2017,Apr 23 2020,1
9311,Mini wire failing...,1,19, BD biners always seem flimsy and the wire gates are sensitive to dirt. Although not as bad as camp biners. I def prefer DMM or Petzl~ they make much more solid biners. I almost always think there is a better option than BD gear except the UL Cams and pitons. Looks like your biner got busted on a rock and that can happen to any biner. ,Sep 2010,Apr 23 2020,0
9312,Mini wire failing...,1,20, i think the takeaway is to be more careful about making sure biners aren't going to get loaded in a weird way.  in situations with a horizontal sometimes you might need to clip into the thumb loop (if the cam has one)~ or basket hitch the cam sling with the alpine draw sling~ to avoid this scenario.,Dec 2004,Apr 23 2020,2

9315,New 5.10 Dragon vs OG Dragon vs UP Sirius,1,2, I found that the UP sirius (blue) was a bit wider~ and also quite a bit stiffer than the dragon. They also have significantly less heel tension. The lacing system is much improved in terms of functionality~ but also takes longer to tighten and tie up. Overall I liked it as bit less~ never tried the new dragons or the red sirius.,Jul 2013,Apr 22 2020,0
9316,New 5.10 Dragon vs OG Dragon vs UP Sirius,1,3, I dont own a pair myself~ but I've climbed in the Sirius LV (red) before. In my experience they're comparable to the dragon~ if anything the heel might be stiffer. Better than the new dragon~ so I've heard.,Sep 2018,Apr 23 2020,0

9318,Cam spring,1,1, That happens from time to time.  I have fixed quite a few.  Just to getting it back in place is easy with needle nose pliers~ tweezers and /or a bike spoke.  It probably pop again so try a little tweek on the angle of the wire bend.  Super-glue wont cut it because parts rotate.  GL,May 2008,Apr 16 2020,3

9323,Cam spring,1,6, Not sure if it'll help~ but I once did this same fix (re-wound the spring and got it back into the cam lobe) on a #00 Master Cam in a car on the way to the crag. The tool that was most useful was a pen (a clicker pen~ take the ink tube and spring part out of the pen). You then take the tip of the pen and put that on the part of the spring that sticks out~ then wind it back around and then push it back into the hole on the cam lobe.,Dec 2014,Apr 17 2020,1
9324,Cam spring,1,7, I've been trying to carefully fit it back in the hole using some dental tools and very tiny pliers~ but it feels like I'm going to unwind the spring even more when I pull it over the side of the lobe.

9327,Cam spring,1,10," I don't think this was communicated correctly. The hole that the spring goes in is on the side of the lobe. In order to put the pin in the hole that's on the side of the lobe I first have to position the pin Over the hole That's on the side of the lobe. I guess every face of the cam lobe is ""a side"" so I can see where the confusion is. Currently the spring is being prevented from unwinding further by the bottom face of the lobe. If I move it away from that~ I lose that safeguard~ and it could unwind further if I slip. That's all. No reply from wild country yet",Jun 2019,Apr 17 2020,0
9328,Cam spring,1,11, You may get it back in.. but you can definitely get WC to give you a brand new cam. Just ask nicely and explain the cam has seen very little use since being purchased. Springs should not just come out like this... hence 40 year old friends still operating just fine. I suspect the lateral movement of the lobes on the axle are the cause for the spring slipping. Had it happen to some sloppy C4s of mine. ,May 2017,Apr 17 2020,1

Something that big goes in the seconds pack :). But it's still very useful to be able to clip it to things so it doesn't get dropped. I sewed a loop of https://www.rei.com/product/610111/bluewater-58-climb-spec-tubular-webbing like you would sew a normal sling~ but folded the outer end back to form a carabiner hole on the outside. Then stitched through the 3 layers of webbing with the greatest portable sewing tool known - speedystitcher.com/ The loop is just a tiny bit smaller than the nalgene so it takes a while to work it up onto the bottle. it sits snug against a narrow loop of duct tape that serves to make the bottle a tiny bit wider so it doesn't work its way off. This works with nalgenes because they're so inflexible/solid. When you hang off it the webbing distorts from a perfect ring/circle~ to an oval~ causing it to grip tighter. I do mean hang off~ after it being on there a few years I hung it on my pullup bar gripped the bottle and could do pullups/bounce off it without it moving. Not the biggest fan of just wrapping stuff in a huge wad of duct tape~ often crap sticks to it~ and you get adhesive left behind or on your hands and it looks shit. Learn to sew a little! Having said all that~ this hydropak looks good. Does it leave a taste/odour like camelbaks? Those things give me headaches.

9362,Scarpa Vapor Lace 2020 vs. Instinct line sizing,1,0, How does the new Vapor Lace compare to the Instinct line when sizing? I see that the Vapor has a more narrow profile and i don't want to get it wrong ordering online.,Apr 2016,Apr 15 2020,0
9363,Scarpa Vapor Lace 2020 vs. Instinct line sizing,1,1, I'm having trouble finding out info on this as well. I talked to a scarpa rep a few weeks ago and got a little info though. ​I have the Instinct vsr and the Chimera sized tight at 39.5 that works perfect for single pitch sport. I'm getting the Vapor as a slightly more comfortable trad shoe~ so the rep recommended going a half size up. I've also tried on the Vapor V and the size felt the same as my Instincts and Chineras. I've read that the new Vapor lace follows the same sizing as the Vapor V. I'd assume that you should get the same size as your instincts if you want the same performance level~ or go up a half size for a slightly more comfort like I am.,Nov 2017,Apr 20 2020,0
9364,Scarpa Vapor Lace 2020 vs. Instinct line sizing,1,2, Thanks for the comment! I ended up rolling the dice and ordered them in the same size as my single pitch redpoint sizing for Instinct VS~ VSR and S and they fit exactly as i wanted them to! They are noticeably narrower in the toe than the Instinct line~ but that's what i want in an edging shoe anyway. Out of the box i was able to boulder on my 65 degree home wall without taking them off for 30 minutes at a time with no pain. Perfect tight fit. If i were getting the Vapor lace for an all day/multipitch shoe i would personally size up 1/2 or maybe even a full size from my Instinct size if i was going for extreme comfort/sock wearing  comfort. So far i am loving the feel. I haven't got on any face climbs with them yet~ but i can tell they are gonna perform well for me. They leave much to be desired on overhung terrain~ but that's not a surprise as that's not what they're designed for.,Apr 2016,Apr 20 2020,0
9365,Scarpa Vapor Lace 2020 vs. Instinct line sizing,1,3, Thanks for the info! Glad they worked out. Sounds like my 40's will be a good fit for cracks and multi-pitch when they come in.

9366,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,0,           From the stance of someone needing an especially wide toe box due to a bunion (and arthritis in the joint)~ I feel like either the Grafton or Wahweap are good options. I haven't found another approach shoe yet that doesn't squeeze my toes and hurt after a while~ and not require an extra size-and-a-half up. I love Altra's for running; now I hope they stick with their approach shoe. I checked out demo models (women's sm - all the store had) and they look great and feel light~ but I won't know until they get my size in. I am just wondering what people out there are experiencing walking on everything from sandy boulders to polished slabs. I see they aren't super still so I might through a Super Feet insole inside.         All I could find so far was here https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/117298602/minimalistbarefoot-approach-shoe and it seemed like folks weren't too thrilled with the rubber~ but then again~ this is Altra's first rodeo in the approach shoe market so maybe~ with some time~ they'll get it right.,Apr 2015,Aug 9 2019,0
9367,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,1, Hey for what it’s worth~ I emailed Altra in regards to the Grafton. I was asking about its trail running capabilities along with it being an approach shoe. I always run in Lone Peak 4s but hate using them for the approach and they sent me this email. Trying to have one less pair of shoes in my travel bag. She references sizing in the email. For my sizing: I wear a 10.5 in Nike~ 44 in La Sportiva Nepal Evo and Baruntse~ but have to wear an 11 in Altra. Maybe this helps.

9370,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,4, Broke in my new Graftons at Courtright Reservoir this week and I really love them. They do more or less fit true to size~ though I vacillate between 10.5 and 11 depending on Altra model. I went with 10.5 since that's what I wear in Superiors and they are snug and fit well with thin socks. The rand rubber kinda bumps my toe tips with thicker socks on. They felt stiff out of the box~ but after a while they have softened up and feel similar to other Altra trail runners when walking on flat ground. Still stiff enough to be supportive while hiking~ scrambling~ and doing easy climbing. I wore them on a 5.4 granite slab route and the rubber felt very grippy and trustworthy. Ended up soloing around 100 ft to the top of the formation in them and never worried about losing grip (granted the angle was pretty low). They are the most comfortable approach shoe I have ever worn (I usually wear Scarpa Crux and Adidas Swift Solo). I hope they hold up long enough for a resole as I would prefer Stealth rubber~ however the Vibram rubber they come with seems good and I never hesitated or slipped on a variety of granite surfaces. My only complaint is the lack of a pull tab for putting them on/clipping to harness.,Jun 2016,Aug 17 2019,4
9371,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,5, Nice review~ the Wahweap is my new go-to casual shoe~ I'll grab a pair of the Grafton for walk offs.  Wish they made a mid top version.,Jul 2017,Aug 17 2019,1
9372,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,6, Any of you guys who bought the Grafton: how did they hold up to hiking with a pack?  I have many pairs of their running shoes and the cushioning doesn't hold up to hiking because they aren't made for hiking. I'm hoping the Grafton is more like an actual approach shoe? Wahweap has the rubber on the toe/heel and looks about like the Evolv Cruzer? ie~ ok to wear around the crag but not to hike to the crag. Especially if you're carrying a heavy pack.,Jan 2004,Nov 26 2019,0
9373,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,7, They’re not super supportive~ I sprained my ankle in them hiking with a pack. Then again~ I’m always spraining that ankle and still insist on wearing soft-ish shoes.,Jun 2016,Nov 26 2019,1
9374,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,8, Foot support doesn't equate to ankle support~ lol. If you sprain your ankle often it's because you never got your proprioception back. Youtube has a ton of drills that make a huge difference for that.  I'm mostly asking to know how the materials of the footbed and sole hold up to wear and tear.,Jan 2004,Nov 27 2019,0

9376,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,10, How do the Grafton hold up over time? I’ve just picked up a pair to replace my Scarpa Crux as the toe box was too pointy for me. The shoe seems nice but I’m a little concerned about the canvas material around the side and rear of the shoe~ feels like it won’t last long. Has anyone had any durability issues? What’s the sole like on grass and mud~ again looks a little sub optimal for that~ but I live in a wet area so ideally would like some deeper lugs.,Apr 2020,Apr 21 2020,0
9377,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,11, I got a pair of the Grafton and they are not very robust. They got all floppy and started coming apart after about 10 days of hard use. I highly recommend what I got as a replacement~ the Scarpa Zen Pro ( I got the mid )~ they are built like a brick s-house. While not quite as wide as a toe-box~ they do allow for a wider foot with the lacing. I got them on discount at STP~ with coupon about 50% off. They had every size~ I guess the shoe isnt very popular. ,Jul 2017,Apr 21 2020,0
9378,Looking for reviews on Altra's Grafton and Wahweap (esp. from bunion sufferers),1,12, The material is holding up fine~ though stitching is coming apart from normal use. Comfortable~ but definitely not as durable as my old Scapra Crux.,Jun 2016,Apr 21 2020,0
9379,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,0, I currently climb with a Wild Country Vision harness but its getting to be about time for a replacement.  I like the wild country brand and was psyched to try the updated Syncro.   Right after the new harnesses came out Wild Country announced a recall - now the new Syncro seems to be totally off the market without any news on when/if it may show up again.   Anybody know anything about when/if/where they might show up again?,Aug 2009,Feb 4 2017,0

9381,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,2, I spoke with WC on this - they recalled the Syncro for 2016~ said it was a buckle slipping issue I think. The next version should be out in spring 2017.,Dec 2008,Feb 6 2017,0
9382,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,3, I have previous version of this harness (green). I really dislike it. the buckles are horrible. I have 3 of the four taped and they still slip! I have to constantly tighten it~ especially when I double rack up. It constantly feels like my pants did in middle school :)   In addition~ I snapped 3 different gear loops (trad gear in chimney) and sent it in for warranty replacement. I was hoping the replacement would have better buckles... nope. just as bad.    The recall does not cover my version of the harness~ even though the buckles and webbing are the same. The previous version to mine has no issues (according to friends that love them).    I will not be buying a harness from wild country from quite some time. Its gonna be the BD Big Gun or MM Cadillac once i get enough cash to justify a big harness purchase again..... :(,Apr 2013,Feb 6 2017,1
9383,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,4, Has anyone had any more recent experience with the Syncro harnesses?

9385,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,6, Ross~I have climbed in the Syncro quite a bit but I don’t Use it very much anymore if that tells you anything....It’s not a bad harness. Light weight~ outside fabric is fairly durable~ and it has plenty of gear loops as well. I still imagine myself using it from time to time. I especially if I have to squeeze up something where the harness profile could matter. Id also consider bring it out for single pitch stuff~ or objectives where weight mattered and I knew I’d be standing on ledges and not solely hanging in the harness.My main issue with the Syncro was it was ultimately really uncomfortable in hanging belays. The waist belt probably has the least amount of padding than any other harness I have looked at besides maybe something from Arc'teryx. And the waist belt profile is differnt than most other harnesses. Syncro waist belt goes higher on the love handles and is narrowest at your spine. My partner and I kept working a route at the time with an unavoidable hanging belay and sometimes we weren’t timely~ so I’d be hanging in my harness for an hour plus maybe longer. No harness is going to feel great at that point~ but I’d come back from these belays with bruised love handles and my lower back would be killing me. IMO from those experiences I need a harness waist belt with a higher backing at the spine if I’m going to be hanging. My one other small gripe is the inside fabric of the harness isn’t very durable~ so if you do lot of body scumming or off-widths it might not be as durable for you. Im a big time body scummer and I’d take the harness off to find the padding on the inside of my leg loops had holes in it and I just hadn’t seen that on other harnesses.One day after hanging in that thing for another hour I went directly from the climb and purchased a Misty Cadillac~ but I still have my Syncro and will use it from time to time.So by far not the worst harness but not the best either. It works great has caught me when I have fallen and definitely has its place and like I said I still plan on using mine in the right situation.hope that helps!Best~R,Sep 2012,Apr 21 2020,2
9386,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,7, Thanks R~ I think backcountry may allow me to return it unopened so may try that. I was really looking for a comfortable multi pitch harness and as a 250 pound climber sounds like this harness would be rough to hang in. Also with the comments on durablilty and multiple gear loops breaking I don't think the harness will hold up well for me.,Jun 2011,Apr 21 2020,0
9387,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,8, Yeah I’m 195 and it would just cut into my back and waist so bad I felt like It could hurt me at some points. My Misty Cadillac is very comfortable and I haven’t had the same feeling while wearing that harness.,Sep 2012,Apr 21 2020,1
9388,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,9, The Syncro looks good and I was going to order one from Verti Call as they're on sale for $120 CDN which is like $85 in real money but am reconsidering after R Sather's post.

9390,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,11, WC makes great cams~ nuts~ biners etc. so I don't get why they'd release sub-par harnesses.  I bought their Mission for sport cause it was light and only $40 but it's such a ball crusher that I'm afraid to fall in it. Great for the onsight though. Really spurs me on!,Dec 2010,Apr 21 2020,2
9391,What's the deal with Wild Country Harnesses?,1,12, Yeah idk I was disappointed~ but it’s not like the harness is going to kill you. It still works and excels in some aspects better than others. It’s a decent harness at that price point. Companies like Misty specialize in just making harnesses though and they make damm good ones. Maybe that has something to do with it. Idk. Not much new or prudent info in this comment. More just opinion. Good luck in your harness search!,Sep 2012,Apr 21 2020,1
9392,Gore pro delam,1,0, has anyone had issues with gore pro delaminating frequently. I want to get a hard shell but have heard of horror stories about the alpha sv and how it constantly delaminates after a year or two. Curious if it’s the backer on the gore or if it’s the gore itself. I understand that companies offer lifetime warranties but come on it’s quite frustrating to pay $400-$800 on a gore pro shell and have to replace it frequently.,Dec 2019,Apr 20 2020,0
9393,Gore pro delam,1,1, Most people don't take proper care of their hardshells. Laminated and taped materials will eventually delaminate~ that is just a fact of life. However~ with proper care you should be easily able to get 5-10 years of life out of one~ especially when you only use it when necessary (ie~ the weather sucks). In general~ GTX Pro should be washed 2-4 times a year~ with proper detergent and proper settings. If you never wash it~ then your 800 dollar jacket will indeed crap out in a year or two due to salt and acid buildup.  I have a Fjällräven Bergtagen Eco-Shell and a much lighter Mammut Masao Light. Both are about two years old~ both are taken proper care of and I only use them when I actually need them~ and both are still as good as new.,Feb 2020,Apr 20 2020,2
9394,Gore pro delam,1,2, The new Pro had issues with contamination due to the new open structure of the membrane~ it's why gore have now bought back into service the previously discontinued Pro shell (rebranded of course) these issues were coming from arcteryx according to the gore rep and we can expect to see it on jackets like the alpha sv. I had my alpha fl crap out on me after very light use doing my best to baby my expensive jacket. ,Oct 2015,Apr 20 2020,0

Very minimal delam. I wash it... yeah maybe four times a year with tech wash. As far as I know the big issue is people sweating their skin oils all over these things and then never washing them.,Sep 2014,Apr 20 2020,0
9399,Gore pro delam,1,7, Same~ I love my Eco-Shell. GTX has a name brand reputation but technology wise it's pretty outdated. Gore is now realising this as well and they have put themselves on an improvement timeline over the next five years. ,Feb 2020,Apr 21 2020,0
9400,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,0," This has been on my mind for some time. Last fall I loaned my 70m 9.8 to a friend for the weekend. When I get it back I get informed that they bailed off a route and did not have a bail biner so threaded it directly through the bolt hanger and was lowered. Looking at my rope~ the part that went through the bolt while weighted is a little ""fuzzy"". I have inspected it like 5 times but not yet taken it out myself. There are no noticeable soft spots as far as I can tell but i'm also no expert. you can't see the core at all. Do you guys think the rope is safe to use? it's pretty beefy and from what i've read the core is the important thing so the sheath damage isn't the end of the world. Or could there be core damage that isn't obviously soft or disconnected that will manifest itself as a rope failure in a few years? Any experience/ opinions on this appreciated. ",Apr 2020,Apr 19 2020,0

9402,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,2, I'm curious as to how he was attached to the bolt hanger while threading the rope through it. Did he have a carabiner~ just not one he was willing to leave?,Aug 2016,Apr 19 2020,36
9403,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,3, The rope's probably fine~ but I wouldn't lend it to him again. Edit: I don't think you could lower through regular hangers without severely damaging the rope.  You sure he didn't rappel?,Nov 2009,Apr 19 2020,34
9404,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,4, oh for sure. He had draws at the very least and maybe more. He's just new and apparently felt like risking 180$ of my gear as opposed to 10$ of his,Apr 2020,Apr 19 2020,59

9406,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,6, Some hangers would have a more forgiving shape than others~ but it's always a really dumb thing to do.,Jul 2019,Apr 19 2020,13
9407,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,7, I have rappelled off of a naked bolt several times with no drama.  Not like I make a habit of it~ but it has happened a few times in the past 20 years! Lowering off of a bolt is a different story~ however~ and could damage the sheath. I would expect to see a line of sheath damage all the way down the rope from the rope rubbing against the sharp edge of the hanger. There are several hanger profiles that would be just fine to lower off of (rope damage wise)~ however. ,Apr 2006,Apr 19 2020,10
9408,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,8, Yep~ another in the “never loan a rope” camp. Even friends do stupid things.  I once saw a strong -very young- climber easily sail through a 12c crux only to lower off a bolt a ways after that. Mental and physical strength are not equal.,Jul 2008,Apr 19 2020,12
9409,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,9, To be willing to damage someone else’s gear to avoid using your own to fix a situation you got yourself into is pretty selfish. Everything you have with you is bail gear if you need to bail.  It’s not like your rope is ruined or unusable~ but that is a lot of wear on it for one TR session~ and wear that was completely unnecessary. Might be reasonable to ask your friend to contribute some small amount toward the eventual rope replacement based on the excessive wear and tear~ like $20? Not so much to compensate you but to help them learn to think twice before potentially damaging a $200 piece of gear before being willing to sacrifice a $5 biner. It’s certainly possible to get a core-shot lowering through a hanger~ and then you would need to replace the rope. Or just to drive home the point that ALL your gear can and should be sacrificed if you need to get to the ground safely.  Just a thought. You know your friend better than we do~ maybe he’s already fully aware of lessons learned. ,Apr 2010,Apr 19 2020,13

9411,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,11, A similar thing happened to me at City of Rocks. I rapped  off draws on the Just Say No anchors with a 70m Mammut 9.8 and my newbie partner J was going to clean the draws~ set the rappel and rap. J had done this several times previously on the trip. If I remember correctly~ there are links or chains of some sort on the anchors. No problem~ right? So J sets it up~ raps down the rope and we try to pull it. It doesn't move. What the &%$# ?? In our discussion~ J said they threaded the rope directly through the bolt hangers. Why? No clue. We moved all over the base area and finally got an angle that worked to retrieve the rope and pulled like hell.  I think the rope is basically fine and I still use it.  The story is different if you are lowering through a bolt hanger. ,Jan 2008,Apr 19 2020,2

9418,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,18," I mean like I said it's ""fuzzy"" on the section he lowered on- a little layer of fluff on the surface of the sheath. Its not like super fluffy though just barely visible. I have tried feeling~ pinching~ and tugging every inch of the fuzzy section trying to feel for core damage yet feel none. However i'm not sure i would recognize some subtle core damage if I felt it anyways. Maybe i'll try and have someone really experienced analzye it~ or I could always cut the fuzzy section and turn it into a 55 or 60. ",Apr 2020,Apr 19 2020,0
9419,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,19, Assuming you know what you’re feeling for~ damage that’s too subtle to notice when you’re super intently looking for it isn’t damage I’d worry about. <I am not a rope-ologist> The type of damage that happens from lowering through a hanger is the type of damage the sheath is there to protect your core from. Or maybe damage to the core from being weighted over a teeny tiny surface area. If the sheath is intact and the core isn’t mushy~ I’d whip on it. <I am not a rope-ologist> Fuzzy sheath can be annoying but isn’t in itself unsafe. I’d be more worried about the condition of your friend’s climbing skills~ judgment~ and/or friendship more than that of your rope. ,Apr 2010,Apr 19 2020,4
9420,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,1,20, What he probably did is make your rope a lot stiffer~ putting months of wear on it in minutes.  Reduced elasticity isn't something you can detect by feeling the rope~ but we know it happens to a significant extent as a result of ordinary rappelling~ so it is reasonable to assume lowering over a relatively sharp edge would be a far more severe type of wear. Since all ropes wear~ we all climb with compromised ropes all the time.  How much depletion of the rope's original capabilities we can tolerate is almost entirely a matter of psychology~ as there is no way to know how good or bad the rope is.  With the minimal amount of sheath damage you've described~ I'd guess the rope is ok for most climbing~ at least where big falls and sketchy gear are not involved.  If you find yourself above your gear and worrying about how rope will perform~ then you probably need a new rope~ and your idiot friend should pay half the cost. Oh~ and I'd never lend him anything mission-critical again.  Ever.,Feb 2008,Apr 20 2020,20

9425,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,2,4, I take comfort in two things - many folks climb on ropes FAR more beat-up than anything I still use. And there's ZERO history of any rope breaking absent chemical damage or a sharp edge. Yes but---focusing on breakage is the wrong perspective---which is why I brought up stiffening.  A stiffer rope applies higher loads to gear~ faller~ and belayer.  It happens to all ropes~ but I think the OP might have gotten a relatively big dose compared to how ropes normally wear; his rope might be newly old.,Feb 2008,Apr 20 2020,5
9426,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,2,5," If your ""friend"" threaded the rope through the bolt~ that means (presumably) he tied himself in with a biner & sling while untieing~ threading and re-tieing-in prior to being lowered. That he/she didn't just leave even a good  $6 or $7 biner (or even a whole $12 quick draw~ if that's all he/she had) instead of compromising a $250 rope is just beyond belief to me.",Aug 2013,Apr 20 2020,6
9427,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,2,6, The most likely explanation is ignorance. The friend did not know that lowering through a bolt hanger would damage the rope~ or maybe it did not occur to him that he could safely lower off the gear he had available. Or maybe someone else told  him it was fine to lower through the bolt hanger and he trusted that person. This is not innate knowledge you're born with; it's stuff you acquire over time. Hopefully the OP has talked with his friend~ made it clear why this was a poor decision~ and discussed what might have been better. It's up to the OP whether to ask the friend to pay for his ignorance~ and if so~ how much.  To answer the OP's question~ the rope is safe to use if there are no obvious flat core spots or rips in the sheath. To rgold's point~ the rope has sustained abnormal wear~ will not perform as well as it did before~ and probably will need to be retired earlier. ,Apr 2014,Apr 20 2020,4
9428,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,2,7," Did your ""friend"" happen to take this rope to The Red? Because last year I witnessed this exact thing happening at Roadside on a mid 5.12. The day before it had been humid~ and all of the holds were greasy~ and this small group of newer-looking climber was wandering around trying to find something easy to try. Alas~ all the easy stuff was being climbed~ so they got on the easiest route around and couldn't get past the first bolt. IF it was the same person~ they had plenty of draws/biners but instead decided to use a PAS to clip into the first bolt~ feed the rope through~ and lower. Regardless~ I think they owe you a new rope.

9431,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,2,10, No worries..... to fix the fuzziness of your new rope you will need the help of your good friend. First thing build a big ass bonfire. After it has burned down to red embers you need to arrange it - your rope- so it will pull freely (like you would do to string up a TR) from the pile. Then have your friend take one end - lay the strand into the hot coals then start off walking backwards away from the fire. You hold the rope and control it (Belay gloves work awesome for this and a stick helps) so it goes into the coals - and you control the pull speed- not to fast or the fuzz will not disappear completely like you want.   After you do this- carefully inspect for more fuzzy spots and repeat the process as needed.   Note: you don’t need to build a new fire as long as it’s still hot. (A simple test: see if a piece of TP will ignite in less then 5 seconds- if so~ you’re golden!) Good luck with it.  ,Mar 2008,Apr 20 2020,0

9433,rope threaded through bolt hangar~ still safe?,2,12, I'd give him that rope and have him give you $100.

9468,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,0," Edelrid have released their version of the Micro Trax called the ""Spoc"" progress capture pulley (for those who may be unaware). Noteworthy specs I can find so far are: Micro Trax - 15kn (breaking strength of device~ not rope) Spoc - 15kn (breaking strength of device~ not rope)  Micro Trax - 85 grams Spoc - 60 grams  Micro Trax - 91% efficiency  Spoc - 92% efficiency  Micro Trax - 8mm-11mm Spoc - 7mm-11mm Micro Trax - 25mm sheave diameter  Spoc - 20mm sheave diameter So I see the Spoc as being lighter~ more efficient and can handle skinnier ropes while maintaining the same strength. Not sure how the difference in sheave diameter will play out in my intended use of the device.  My intended use of the device is the same as what I use a Trax for - top rope solo. My questions are... what do you guys think?? Specifically I am very interested to see a pull test with the spoc on a rope to see if it lines up with the micro trax's failure mode of tearing the sheath at around 4kn.  Anybody have their hands on one? What do you think - an improvement on the micro trax or just another manufacturer trying to grab some market share from the gods at petzl?",May 2017,Mar 6 2019,2
9469,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,1, I have a roll n lock. It weights 80 grams. It’s great for TR solo~ but weird as a hauler or ascender because the roll action takes a few inches of rope to lock down. It’s also way cheaper than the micro or spoc. But that spoc looks pretty sweet. ,Oct 2009,Mar 6 2019,2

9471,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,3, Hadn't heard about this new device.  Thanks for posting. Looks like the teeth on this are more aggressive than the Micro Traxion--not sure if that means it would damage the sheath quicker or not.  But assuming you're using a toothless device as your primary this wouldn't be as much of a concern. Is the little wire on the Spoc to disengage progress capture mode?  Not sure if I like that. And how often are you going to be using a rope thinner than 8 mm while TR soloing? : ) The only real advantages seem to be the 25 grams of weight and the $25 cheaper price.  Not sure if either would be enough for me to prefer this to a Micro Traxion~ but I think it would definitely work.  I personally use a  Climbing Technology Roll N'Lock coupled with a Camp USA Lift.  Works great for TR solo for me~ but I don't do any big wall climbs so don't really need the haul functionality of a progress capture device (which I've heard is much better with the Micro Traxion).,May 2018,Mar 6 2019,1
9472,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,4, I've been looking at picking this up for crevasse rescue and self-rescue applications. The weight and price point are certainly more attractive than the Microtrax. ,Nov 2012,Mar 6 2019,2
9473,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,5, It is. For those who wish to eliminate that feature~ it seems that it would be easy to clip the wire. Modifying the microtrax in this way is a bit more difficult.,May 2016,Mar 6 2019,1
9474,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,6, I already have two Microtrax for TR soloing. Looks like 6 of one~ half a dozen of another to me...I also own a Grigri.  Too much stuff~ so little time.,Jul 2015,Mar 6 2019,3
9475,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,7, I'm with Buck on this one. I don't see this device as an improvement on the Microtraxion for toprope soloing. The wire seems like less of a reason to go with the Spoc. Yes~ it can be removed.  It might be better for glacier travel where 30 grams actually means something.,unknown,Mar 6 2019,0
9476,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,8, Obviously no one who already has a microtrax should replace it with this. The question is whether or not someone in the market for a microtrax would have any reason to pay the extra $30 for a device with seemingly slightly lower specs. (Edited to clarify),Mar 2016,Mar 6 2019,8
9477,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,9, It's a fair question. For me~ I'd need to be convinced that the wire doesn't represent increased risk of locking the device open.,unknown,Mar 6 2019,2
9478,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,10, If you're using PCPs to belay on a multipitch and/or protect simul blocks~ the extra weight savings is actually pretty sweet.  I also like the wider diameter clip in point to allow the carabiner to rotate through the PCP.  Also one possible perk to the cable locking mechanism is that if you're prerigging the PCP on the rope as the leader of a simul block~ it might be less prone to engaging mid lead/before you want it to.  It happens all the time with a microtrax when the button gets accidentally pressed while climbing and always spooks me out to think about whipping on the teeth.  Kinda psyched to check these things out! ,Oct 2007,Mar 6 2019,5
9479,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,1,11, I already own a Micro and Roll N Lock~ so I won't be picking up this device. That said~ this looks like a nice device.  I'm sure it will get the job done. Consider it and one of the other two devices as your main/backup device.

9495,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,2,6, I have both.  I haven't used the Spoc for TR soloing~ but it seems less robust than the Microtraxion and therefore less suitable for TR soloing.  IMO~ the Spoc would really only be preferred for emergency only use~ when you want to save a few grams.  ,Aug 2013,May 17 2019,0
9496,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,2,7," I recently purchased the Spoc to try against my MicroTraxion. I use my MicroT for 90% TR soloing~ 9% doing light hauls~ and 1% other stuff (tyroleans~ simul-climbing~ etc). I've had a chance to use the Spoc a bit for TR soloing and light hauling. The following are my thoughts (keep in mind I have a tiny fraction of the mileage on the Spoc as I do on the MicroT): Things I like... 1) The Spoc is noticeably lighter and smaller. 2) The build quality is excellent and I disagree with Karl above - think it is as robust as the MicroT. 3) The ""tunnel"" through which the rope passes (formed by the metal side plates and the sheave) is about 1mm larger than on the MicroT. Also~ the channel of the sheave is not as deep as that of the MicroT. I believe these features explain why I experience a noticeable difference in how easily a rope will slide through the device as compared to the MicroT. For rope soloing~ this means less weight on the rope/the rope will start feeding sooner and more smoothly. I have not tested it on really fat ropes (approaching 11mm) or really skinny ropes (6-7mm tags) yet~ but I suspect it will perform as well as or better than the MicroT. 4) The string used for cam retraction and lockout feels more secure than the button on the MicroT. I think it is less likely to accidentally release when locked in the open position and less likely to accidentally engage when the cam is in the active position. Things I dislike... 1) The cam is much smaller and narrower than that of the MicroT. I worry about this concentrating even more force on a rope over a smaller footprint and possibly causing increased wear and tear/damage. 2) The string used for cam retraction and lockout is definitely more fiddly than the button on the MicroT and I think it could wear out (though it's probably easily replaceable). 3) Retraction of the cam manually is a little more difficult on the Spoc: You have to either use the string to pull it open or manually pull it back from the end of the cam. The latter~ however~ is not quite as easy as doing so with the MicroT which actually has engineered ridges and a larger surface area at the end of the cam to provide grip for retraction. In conclusion~ I haven't reached a verdict yet because I need to put more miles on it. But my suspicion is the Spoc will probably replace the MicroT for my uses primarily because it is noticeably lighter and less draggy on the rope feed. That is worth the tradeoff in ease of use. For TR soloing~ the MicroT/Spoc is my backup device - not my primary - for that reason I worry less about the much smaller footprint of the cam on the Spoc. If these devices were my primary device~ I would use the MicroT. BTW~ Max~ if you haven't used the Kong Frog for protecting simul-climbing~ you should check it out - no worries taking a lead fall with it on the rope IMO.",Jun 2001,May 19 2019,5

I attach it with this amazing super light aluminum Mallion Rapide I found - I’ve never seen another! I attach my backup with a DMM Ultra O Kwiklock - never seen it cross load and even if it does it is strong enough in the minor axis to handle it.

I attach my backup with a DMM Ultra O Kwiklock - never seen it cross load and even if it does it is strong enough in the minor axis to handle it. I’m curious about the PerfectO but have never seen one in person. Roll n lock (80 grams) weight is similar to the MicroT (85 grams). Operation and performance is fairly similar; I don't think the RnL is any more complex than the MicroT. The main reason I have a RnL is that is was way cheaper than buying a second MicroT. I use them pretty interchangeably~ though I've found that I prefer the RnL as primary and the MicroT as secondary. The reason is that the RnL cam is a bit easier to disengage manually~ so if I want to bump back down the rope to retry a move~ it is a bit easier to let a foot of slack out on the RnL. Whereas the Micro is such a positive~ reliable lock on the rope~ it is a very reassuring backup~ but sometimes a bit annoying as a primary if you need to disengage it from a slightly tensioned rope. For hauling~ though~ the MicroT is significantly superior to the RollnLock. With the RollnLock you lose an inch or two of progress with each pull~ as the cam rolls to engage.,Jun 2008,May 19 2019,1

9502,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,2,13, Something pretty similar to a Petzl Torse. The Torse is a great design~ but is a bit overbuilt for my needs (thicker webbing~ bulky buckle).

9503,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,2,14, This. Easy on/off is what I want.

I agree that the rope could pop out of it - especially when pulling at weird angles... but that's why I run a super secure backup. That said~ I've TR rope soloed pretty much anything I can imagine (crazy big roofs and traverses) and have never had it pop off the rope.,Jun 2001,May 19 2019,0
9504,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,2,15," A little update on the Spoc: Yesterday I was TR rope soloing and noticed that the cam retraction cord had somehow been pulled and had slid into the locked position. There was some tension on the cam~ although not enough to retract it~ so it wasn't a big deal but it did get me thinking (and I'll have to revise ""things I like #4"" above). I've heard of people having the cam on a MicroTraxion disengage while rope soloing and move into the locked-out position. People have even filed off the lockout button tab on the MicroTraxion to prevent this. I've never experienced it and it still seems really unlikely to me - but now I can imagine it happening with the Spoc. In much the same way those people have filed off the button~ I may remove the retraction cord from the Spoc (easily done by simply untying a knot) to prevent this from ever happening.",Jun 2001,May 24 2019,2
9505,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,2,16, I have been using the Spoc for TR soloing (with out another device) and overall it works fine and gets the job done. Josh's point about the tooth cam becoming disengaged while climbing is a valid concern~ which one can combat by tying knots in the rope as they climb up. One thing I have noticed with the spoc (which perhaps is the device's biggest pitfall) is that because the clip in point is really big~ it is easy for the spoc to move around on its biner~ potentially going into a cross loading position. ,Dec 2016,Mar 29 2020,2

See the problem is that you are using the device for something it WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR. Edelrid doesnt give a rats ass if almost hit the dirt because you were using it in an off label kind of way.

9527,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,3,18," I totally agree that the Spoc isn't dangerous when used properly. Cross-loading will break many things in unexpected ways. This argument is akin to carabiners being unsafe because they can break if torqued in unusual ways by bolts (nose getting hooked a la Danny Woods). However~ I am not sure that the Spoc isn't designed for TR solo. In the manual (media.edelrid.de/images/att… )~ it sure looks like the climber is going for a quick TR burn in 4a. Also~ it does mention to use a pear or oval shaped carabiner in the manual (didn't know this before looking at it). The Petzl Microtraxion is advertised as a self-belay device (https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/General-principles-for-solo-climbing-with-a-fixed-belay-rope)~ if used in a certain way. I'd assume the Spoc would be expected to be functional in the same way. I do agree that the dude saying the Spoc is dangerous is total bogus. I've had the Spoc open on me while TR solo'ing (back-up behind a traxion) because I jammed the release cord between a rock and my body~ the cam opened. I imagine the same could happen on a Microtrax~ if a rock got pressed against the release tab. Just need to think critically about how these devices behave uniquely and where they might fail.

9530,Edelrid Spoc Vs. Petzl Micro Trax ,4,1, Both devices can have crossload issues so this whole argument isn't really relevant. You should be using a Maillon Rapide Delta with a belay keeper or an oval locker with belay keeper or rubber grommets to keep things centered. What is relevant is the surface area of teeth on the Spoc is smaller than the Micro Trax. Less surface area potentially means more force per sq cm. Yann Camus of Bliss Climbing has done some initial testing showing that perhaps the Spoc damages the rope at lower forces compared to a Micro Trax. Granted 4kn is still probably more than you are ever going to generate top rope soloing unless you really mess something up~ it seems silly to pick the Spoc over the Micro Trax.

9576,What are the softest shoes avilable now?,1,0, My favorite shoes ever were the Mad-Rock Hookers which were like rubber socks.  I might have strong feet because I felt confident on anything in them~ including little edges.  Is there anything similar these days?  Preferably with laces? Also – if anyone has an old pair of Hookers in the 9.5-10 or 40.5-41 range~ in good condition~ I would buy them.  A little bigger might work too.,Jun 2006,Apr 16 2020,0
9577,What are the softest shoes avilable now?,1,1, Having a hard time of thinking of shoft shoes with laces. I’ll be interested to see what shoes others will mention. Maybe mythos? I think the Mavrinks from La Sportiva are some of the softest shoes I have climbed in. I loved them for gym climbing but I weigh about 195 so that might skew my perception of stiffness. I was climbing in the shamans before hand(very stiff) so I have noticed my feet got along stronger(on my 3rd pair of Mavrinks now). Maverinks are designed and do stretch a lot depending on how you size them just an FYI. The new solution comps are also very soft and are similar in stiffness to the Maverinks IMO. Two other new styles of Sportiva comp shoes are coming out I believe and they most likly will be on the soft side too but again none of these shoes I mentioned have laces.

9585,What are the softest shoes avilable now?,1,9, I'd call the Pinks medium stiffness. Softer end of the spectrum for trad shoes~ but not even close to the super soft bouldering slippers. They also change a ton as they wear out. Good for edging when new~ and sock-like near the end of their useful life.

9614,Wet cams with water stuck in the stem and thumb loop (BD C4 and UL),1,15," Rice might work~ but silica gel would probably work better.  Used to be able to get it at ""Drug Stores""~ but I don't think so anymore. Gun shops sometimes have canisters~ as keeping guns dry for long-term storage is important.  Try there or AMAZON if the rice doesn't work.  (It's easily re-activated and re-used.)  ps - 150F should not hurt the webbing (cars and car trunks easily get to this temp in the sun~ even in the Northeast in the summer...180F in the South) But do be careful if you try this~ as somewhere up above 200F (?) it might.  Nylon melts around 450F.  ",Aug 2013,Apr 16 2020,1

9625,outside rope,1,6, Sterling Ion R 9.4mm Bi-color If you don't like the price on this one~ The Sterling Pro 10.1mm feels and behaves more like a 9.5mm rope and is much less expensive.

9626,outside rope,1,7, Interesting Graham~ I've had 2 edelrid Boa ecos and I've found that they were considerably less durable than other ropes. I do put them through the ringer and climb on them often but I've noticed the sheath fuzzing up disturbingly quickly.,Mar 2017,Apr 9 2020,1

The Energy 9.5 is lighter than the Booster 9.7 and I've found Edelweiss to last a little longer outside~ even if it starts out stiffer.

9632,outside rope,1,13, Interesting to hear other's experiences with the Boa Eco.  Wonder if it has something to do with every rope being a little different because they use leftover fibers from the production of other ropes?

9634,outside rope,1,15, I got a Sterling velocity as a gift shortly before quarantine~ still haven't had a chance to use it. I'm crossing my fingers it lasts longer than the Edelrid boa ecos and that I'm not just a terrible rope owner.,Mar 2017,Apr 10 2020,0
9635,outside rope,1,16, It has been my experience for 25+ years of climbing~ that if you use a rope tarp~ or flake your rope off of the ground~ it will last MUCH longer than if you just throw it in the dirt.  Your biners will look nice longer as well~ as will all of the fixed anchors you lower off.  I have owned a bunch of ropes~ and given some away that I simply hated~ but Sterling and Mammut have never let me down as far as handling or longevity. It may be partly because I treat them nice and store them properly. I rarely look at the price tag...I just get the rope I want.   I think pricewise~ Tendon ropes and Roca ropes outperform some of the more popular brands in the US~ and can be found occasionally at very nice prices.  One of my partners has a Tendon that I really liked~ 9.7mm that was really light and flowed through draws well~ nice sport rope.,Jul 2015,Apr 10 2020,4
9636,outside rope,1,17, Thanks everyone to take time answer me but finally I've decided to take the edelrid Tommy Caldwell because it look to be a good rope and i got a very good deal on it too ! Someone has it too ?,Oct 2018,Apr 17 2020,0
9637,outside rope,1,18, Eco Boas are by far the least durable ropes I've ever owned and used. I've seen them trashed in a single trip.  Also bi-pattern ropes are nice~ but they cost more and it severely limits the options you have. A better solution is to just buy a light colored rope~ and remark it as it fades. ,Jun 2011,Apr 17 2020,2
9638,outside rope,1,19, Not mine:,Jul 2009,Apr 18 2020,0
9639,outside rope,1,20, Be very careful in making the assumption that bi-pattern ropes make it easy to spot a transition. A bi-pattern rope does not change any colors at the mid point; just the pattern of the weave changes. In many bi-pattern ropes it's almost impossible to see the transition zone from twenty feet; if the light is good. Petzl and Beal Unicore both agree and do not offer the bi-pattern option. If spotting the middle mark is your goal I suggest that you buy a light color rope and re-do the middle mark every few months. Or~ better yet~ buy a light color bi-pattern rope AND mark the middle. Climb safe~ Mal,Jan 2001,Apr 18 2020,4

9647,Survey for new concept product,1,7, Hi Brad~ Are you an industrial design major? I am currently doing a master's in ID~ with the intention of designing climbing/highlining/outdoor gear in my future.  Just took the survey. Here's the issue I see-- the biggest reason to climb in the cold is that your skin has a higher coefficient of friction against the rock when it's cold. Interview some double digit boulderers~ and they will likely have certain conditions they like for sending on certain types of rock. They go out and suffer in the cold just  to get the right temp on the rock-skin contact point. This seems to be biggest in bouldering~ but elite climbers in other disciplines also pay attention to temps. Personally~ when I climb in the cold it's because I want to climb and it happens to be cold~ just like when I climb in the heat it's because I want to climb and it happens to be hot. I don't like being cold~ but the one upside is better friction with my skin. (I'm more focussed on long routes/alpine climbing~ but I've known some pretty fanatical boulderers.) Your proposed device heats the one surface of your body which would benefit from being cold. Now~ I get cold hands and feet very easily~ so I understand the motivation to build a hand warmer for climbers.  Integrating heat and chalk would be a no-go for me. What if I want to do one but not the other? I'm a bit particular about chalking up right before I touch the rock~ and minimizing chalk on myself/gear. The time I want chalk is when I'm actively climbing~ and when I want to warm my hands is when I'm belaying/eating/resting/etc. I'm guessing you are targeting climbers who go cragging or bouldering in the cold~ rather than alpine/backcountry climbing. I would say that between bouldering~ single pitch cragging and multipitch climbing the user needs and product requirements change drastically~ so if you haven't yet~ I would clearly define who my target user is.  I've never done heat packs in the chalk bag. If I can't feel my hands~ I put them inside my puffy in my armpits until I can feel them again.  Lastly~ if I were tasked with this issue~ I would consider heated wearables. I think there could be some interesting ideas around pinpointing where heat is applied~ say near blood vessels that are close to the skin. I personally like low tech solutions~ and maybe I'd design a neoprene pouch to hold a disposable chemical hand warmer on the inside of each wrist. Perhaps some research in the physiology of heat loss could direct the solution.  I hope that this doesn't read too harshly~ I don't mean it that way and tone is lost in text. I am familiar with the struggle to design for niche activities with professors and classmates who don't really understand the application~ so I just wanted to share my ideas in case something might help. Also~ I'm procrastinating on doing my design homework...need 5 rough models for Monday... Jonathan  ,May 2015,Apr 16 2020,3

I prefer to start with warm hands when I pull onto cold rock.  I also get way more pumped if my fingers are going numb.

Being from Minnesota~ there are really only 4-5 months of the year where you can even feel your hands while climbing~ so if you want to climb at all consistently~ your hands are going to be numb by the second bolt.

It's the Amazon business model; you see the same thing if you look at their financial records. They have very tiny profits for the amount of revenue they have. Not because they can't make a bunch of profit if they want~ but because if they ruthlessly optimize~ cut costs~ and reinvest in the business. Why? They can put everyone out of business on their thin margins. They effectively put Barnes & Noble out of business by selling books at a loss~ because they can make up the money elsewhere. Microsoft was only ever trying to take over the world of consumer software (they did~ by pretty ruthless tactics as well). Amazon is not targeting a single industry.

Like others I placed my order online~ and about 4 days passed till I heard anything from them~ and then the updates from DHL were really slow~ and then one day several updates posted the package cleared customs and was out for delivery. They arrived at my door~ about 2 weeks later. ,Aug 2014,Jan 28 2020,1
9722,Backpacking-united.com,1,8, I had a great experience with them a few weeks back. Ordered a GriGri in gray on my phone- price listed was $48.80 before shipping/tax.  Learned from another member on here that their mobile site doesn't list all options available~ since there were blue ones in stock as well even though they didn't show on the mobile site. I emailed them the next day asking if they could possibly swap the grey for the blue one- Got a response later that day that it was no problem.  The order shipped a couple days later~ and got to me in a little over a week.  Total cost to my door was $71 USD for a brand new 2019 Grigri~ so $40 off normal US retail.  $49~ plus $13 for shipping.  The invoice said $61 and change~ but my bank statement actually showed $71.  One of the emails from BU had the total of 61 in euros~ so upon further reflection~ I may need to contact PayPal to see what happened there. Edit- Yup~ the total in the BU email said $61 dollars~ but in reality it was actually euros~ so the $71 was correct at the time. I also confirmed with Petzl that backpacking-united is an authorized retailer~ so shouldn't need to worry about counterfeit items.,Oct 2019,Jan 28 2020,1
9723,Backpacking-united.com,1,9, Yeah~ I was as skeptical as everyone else but I looked on Petzl's distributor map and there they were. Odd business model but if we get the stuff for cheap I guess I don't care. I have a static rope arriving today. :),Dec 2017,Jan 28 2020,0

9744,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,1,0, I bought a revo to try out for rope soloing as it feeds well and can lock during an inverted fall but I didnt like how fast you needed to fall to get it to lock (think slabs). Last night I was toying with the revo and noticed that this spring is what causes the tension that the centrifical force is fighting to engage the lock.,Mar 2015,Mar 11 2019,18
9745,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,1,1, I dropped it probably 20 times on each side and decided the drops were consistant enough that I would only measure 5.

9757,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,1,13, Justice~ yer not the only geek here!  You inspired me to replicate your experiment and compare to a Silent Partner.  I’ve used an SP for many years btw~ figured the Revo was superior for solo leading.  After my experiment I’m not so sure! I used a 25 pound barbell btw.  I got pretty consistent measurements with both devices~ +/- 1-2 inches.   Revo averaged 34 inches SP averaged 10 inches Ouch,Aug 2010,Mar 23 2019,2

9759,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,1,15, It works for me as the sp is out of my budget and I'm pretty content so far. I fixed a line last weekend and did 30 tr laps with it and had no problems. Took a few test falls just on tr on low-ish angle terrian and it locked within a foot or 2. I think if you took an actual lead fall you'd lock the thing pretty immediately just from the ammount of momentum you'd pick up in a lead fall,Mar 2015,Mar 23 2019,1

9761,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,1,17, So next question~ how much did you weaken the spring? Finally got to test out my Revo today and really did not enjoy the long fall. It was basically over before I realize it but when I climbed up to some slab I began to start thinking that this mod sounds like an amazing idea. How longb did it take you to weaken it?

9767,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,2,2, Since I've the bits on my workbench ....  The spring has 4 turns so I doubt you are weakening the spring~ you are reducing the preload instead. Go too far and the weight will engage all the time which would be a hassle. Personally in the context of lead falls a few more inches wouldn't interest me in the least!,Nov 2009,Mar 24 2019,2
9768,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,2,3, I getcha~ its all personal preference. Joe posted a photo of one that bent after hitting a backup knot. I figured if you're less likely to hit your knot~ you won't have to retire the thing early.,Mar 2015,Mar 24 2019,0
9769,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,2,4, I was thinking about it more and realized both of our experiments were flawed.  Basically neither device will lock up until the rope passing through it is moving fast enough.  In a lead fall the climber will build up some speed before the device is loaded.  So I did the experiment again with two feet of slack between my 25 pound dumbbell and the Revo...dropped it by hand a foot or more above the device.  Now I’m getting 6-10 inches of rope passing through before it locks up~ which is much better!  The SP gets 2-3 inches. I should point out that the SP is picky about which rope you use...first time I ever used it I had a new Beal Joker and the clove hitch wouldn’t lock up at all...the rope was too slippery.  Fatter worn ropes give too much drag.  So after this latest experiment I’m thinking the Revo is the better device for solo leading...it’s also smaller~ lighter~ and easier to rig. I don’t use either for solo toproping...two Micro-Traxions are superior.,Aug 2010,Mar 24 2019,2
9770,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,2,5, There shouldn't be a different in rope slippage with or without the mod. The friction between the rope and the wheel is the same in both cases. The mod would simply allow the revo to lock at a lower speed like what would happen on low angle terrain. It would also stop a fall shorter if youre closer to or below your last piece which could prevent hitting the backup knot like Justice suggested.,Aug 2017,Mar 24 2019,1
9771,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,2,6," Well yeah~ that's why I kinda wondered about all this. I thought it was obvious that either you fall directly at the gear so the drop would be 1m or you've already fallen further than 1m in which case the lock-up is within 4"". For a normal lead fall rope stretch and the slip from the soft catch  are going to be more interesting.",Nov 2009,Mar 25 2019,1
9772,Revo rope solo- spring modification for faster lockup,2,7, I hope you are at least TR soloing with two strands.  It's generally good practice to use two devices with different mechanism so that you don't have the same failure mode potentially doubled disabling both devices (or in the case of Traxions actually de-sheathing the rope).  I personally use a roll'n'lock and a mini-traxion with the roll'n'lock being the primary device.,Jan 2017,Mar 25 2019,1

Good on ya~ OP~ for being brave enough to do this and submit your work to the scrotiny of the MP wenis whacker brigade*. I rope soloed Maiden Voyage this afternoon with my new Revo and it fed like a dream. Absolutely no lockups in six hundred feet. Full video and review to follow. I plan to test the stock device throughly and then possibly make the OP’s modification. Here’s a clip from the p3 offwidth~ no pre-slack in the device~ just feeding like a boss.

9799,Future of Acopa?,1,13, For starters~ you would need a business plan to obtain financing.  Of course~ given that you would be trying to obtain financing to buy a defunct company~ you will likely need Acopa's business records.  Assuming the brand was for sale~ they'll likely want a confidentiality agreement in place.  That said~ it's sort of the chicken and the egg~ Acopa likely won't give up its information unless they know you are serious (i.e. have financing) and a lender won't agree to financing without having seen Acopa's financials.   Even if you get all that information~ from a lender's perspective the burning question is why did Acopa fail in the first place?  Acopa was in REI~ that was a huge retail point of sale.  However~ IIRC~ Acopa was losing shelf space in REI even before John passed (the company's major marketing asset).  Was that due to supply issues~ marketing~ failure to educate the sales force~ etc.?  You will need to explain how you can make the brand successful when the former owners could not.

9819,New Darts On Basic Mountaineering Objectives,1,0, I just sold my old Sarkens to buy the new Dart crampons. I climb water ice 98% of the time~ but I'm wondering how well they perform on easy mountaineering objectives? I do this like once a year~ so I don't see any reason to buy a different front section unless they actually suck for basic mountaineering. What are your experiences? I've tried them on snow~ but not long enough to draw any conclusions.,Aug 2019,Apr 14 2020,0
9820,New Darts On Basic Mountaineering Objectives,1,1, I have them along with a bunch of other crampons. I prefer them the least for walking on weird surfaces~ but they’re also not so bad. If it only represents 2% of your climbing~ probably not worth buying anything new. ,Mar 2016,Apr 14 2020,1

9827,Space blanket reviews,1,0, Any success stories out there about using a space blanket during an unplanned bivy? They are pretty inexpensive~ but is it really worth adding weight to the pack? Key ask here: do they work or are they just trash? User comments on amazon give these a lot of praise but very few anecdotes...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CQUA28/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A39X1HN6ZHQGNF&psc=1,Aug 2013,Apr 10 2020,0
9828,Space blanket reviews,1,1, I've used the bivy bag that's made of the same mylar material. It's not cheap~ and you do have to be very careful not to rip/abuse it. Something like this:https://www.rei.com/product/813511/sol-emergency-bivy In calm~ warm~ summer nights~ I can get away with using it if I chose a good campsite~ and put on a puffy jacket and insulated pants. I experimented with just a blanket~ but the bivy style worked much better. Having the ground insulated~ even as little as this material will do so~ helps a lot. I wasn't in an emergency setting~ and my naps were planned (and planned to be not very long). If you're using it in an alpine setting~ it may help you survive~ but it's not going to be a happy time. The bivy ver. isn't going to be the most convenient if you can't lay down in it~ so go with just a blanket if that's the case. These things are better than nothing~ but not magical. Saying that~ they weigh nothing~ so throw one in your pack if you want to.,Jan 2014,Apr 10 2020,2
9829,Space blanket reviews,1,2, I've wondered about these in the past as well.  How would you rate the warmth or the blanket style~ compared to packing extra layers?  It seems like if it is roughly equivalent to~ say~ an R1 then it's totally worth it (since it's also a windbreaker).  If it's less than that~ maybe it's better to pack an extra puffy or a summer weight sleeping bag?,Jan 2016,Apr 10 2020,1
9830,Space blanket reviews,1,3, They don't stay put~ are too small~ tear easily. They make an okay ground sheet if you are careful. A large trash bag is more durable and can be made into a vest while climbing or a tiny tent on a ledge sitting in a crouch. If your helmet has a suspension system~ you can tuck one inside it for sudden rain storms.,Dec 2019,Apr 10 2020,3
9831,Space blanket reviews,1,4, I've had to use one of the bivvy sack style ones before when we got forced to bivvy on crap terrain where we couldnt properly set up our tarp and  winds were  higher than expected. It definitely turned an absolutely miserable nights sleep into something slightly tolerable.,Jul 2016,Apr 10 2020,2
9832,Space blanket reviews,1,5," I'd say spend the extra dollars and ounces to get the SOL version. I think there's one that is durable enough to be a ""tarp"" too - that might hold up better in use~ and is probably closer to 10oz than 6.  Definitely plan for the bivy~ then you won't have an unplanned bivy - hear those are the worst   ;)",Oct 2010,Apr 10 2020,2
9833,Space blanket reviews,1,6, Seconding Mattt N.  I've used space blankets in a variety of situations~ planned and unplanned.  The cheapest blanket styles are next to useless: there is no way to fully cover a 6' tall human with one~ other than in the tightest fetal position possible.  They tear easily and offer limited insulation.,Dec 2013,Apr 10 2020,1
9834,Space blanket reviews,1,7, I've been caught out and used them climbing and also spent probably 100+ nights out with them while working as a hotshot and jumper for the USFS.  In my opinion the small foil-ish ones maybe add mental warmth but the crinkly noise they make will drive you nuts.  All I can say is that it's better than nothing.  The heavier duty ones (usually sort of shiny on one side and colored fabric on the other) add some warmth and can be used as shelter.  I'm out of the firefighting biz now so those heavier blankets seem~ well~ a bit heavy for climbing~ though it depends what you are up to and where.  I currently carry one those REI SOL things (where/when appropriate) but haven't spent the night out in one.,Aug 2016,Apr 10 2020,3
9835,Space blanket reviews,1,8, The SOL eblankets (get the two person) are clutch~ along with the bivys. On most big adventures~ I stuff a deployed blanket (that I opened 2 years ago) in the bottom of the pack to fill up the extra space. The SOL stuff is made out of a stretchy material that's way more durable than traditional eblankets.  A blanket can change getting soaked while bailing off a route~ into a forced lunch break while you wait it out at a belay. I survived an unplanned night out in a storm near the summit of baker with an blanket~ but I wished the whole time I hadn't accidentally packed it instead of the bivy bag I had in the bottom of my closet. In the summer the bivys are enough to get you some sleep~ for the weight it's an amazing trade off to carrying a pad~ sleeping bag~ and bivy sack when you need to be light. They can change a life threatening situation into something that's just a bit miserable. If there's a chance of me getting caught out overnight~ or wet far from the car~ I always take one or the other with me. They're both under 4 ounces and can pack down to nothing. ,Jun 2011,Apr 10 2020,4
9836,Space blanket reviews,1,9, Alone the thin ones work I think mostly from cutting wind and slowing evaporation (convection and conduction a greater degree of heat loss than radiation)~ but if you can get them under layers of clothing/insulation they work even better.  The full SOL bivy bags are nice~ work well when used with a sleeping bag~ but don’t breath as well as gore. ,Dec 2019,Apr 10 2020,0
9837,Space blanket reviews,1,10, Even the small basic space blankets are a whole lot better than nothing. You can wrap one around your torso~ under your shell. I've done this a few times~ once after getting very wet and shivery while rapping off a long route. It made a big difference. It's a lot easier to think clearly when you're not shivering.,Oct 2007,Apr 10 2020,1
9838,Space blanket reviews,1,11, Check out the ones from Blizzard they have an air space between the two layers of foil. Heavier~ but in a different class.

9842,Space blanket reviews,1,15," all i can say is that at roughly 28 degrees~ and strongish winds (around 20-25mph)... wearing a pair of jeans  wool socks~ longsleeve shirt~ a softshell jacket and a puffy on top of that...beanie~ and snowgloves... my SOL single ""2 person"" (bullshit) blanket was a two-thumbs-down experience. couldnt get it to stay on my body~ or wrapped around it... wind gets in there and theres no controling the sonofabitch. after an hour of violent shivering~ i used tape to turn it into a ""sleeping bag""and stuffed it chocked-full of pine needles around my body. shivering subsided just enough to get some Z's before soloing the Lost Arrow Spire Tip.  so maybe 1 thumb up after that.",Nov 2019,Apr 14 2020,1

9845,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,0, I have a problem with destroying pants even in regular~ everyday conditions. I have tried a lot of different brands~ including Arborwear~ with no success. Three issues in order of frequency: 1.) Crotch rips during squat type movements 2.) Button pops off when I get up 3.) Walk into something sharp~ causing triangular rip  What are the strongest~ most rugged pants you own? What do you think is the strongest material or blend for pants? How have you successfully repaired/reinforced your pants?  I realize there are behavioral solutions to this (get up carefully~ wear a belt~ don't be clumsy) but that's a different subject.,Jul 2014,Jan 8 2018,0
9846,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,1, My longest lasting have been the Pattagucci Quandary pants. I also have the Black Diamond Dogma pants which are a similar construction to Carhartt pants with the extra knee fabric. They are cotton and on the heavier side~ but they have held up great to some offwidth thrashing.  One of my buddies has like 5 pairs of the Outdoor Research Ferossi pants and swears they're the best. I've had a pair of the prana stretch zions~ but never really liked the fit.  ,Jul 2014,Jan 8 2018,2
9847,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,2, OR Ferossi pants if they made the leg slightly more regular I could get away with wearing them to work and for everything else.,May 2014,Jan 8 2018,1
9848,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,3, The OR deadpoint pant is the most durable pant I have found.  I have a couple of pair that are going on 4 years of heavy use and are still working for me. ( I wear them Climbing but also to work every day~ mountain building using chainsaws and bushwhacking). They are tough pants. They are a mix of cotton and nylon.  I wouldn’t use them in wet conditions but for heavy use in rough dry conditions they are great. ,Aug 2006,Jan 8 2018,1
9849,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,4, 1. You need some stetch~ Lycra or spandex in the mix. Also~ is that where they get thin first (bike riding~ say)? Reinforce from the inside. 2. Button~ sew on with quilting thread. Maybe the waist is too tight? 3. Find matching thread and sew the rip back together~ then put an iron on patch on the inside. If it's not a weird place~ patch on the outside with something cool. If I had my extremely patched and embroidered Levi 501's from the 1970's~ I could auction them for a fortune! Best~ Helen,Aug 2015,Jan 8 2018,2
9850,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,5, Prana Continuum pants so far seem to be pretty bullet proof.  The crotch construction is not a seam from front to back. It’s got a strip that runs up your inseam from one side to the next.  Buttons popping off I’ve got nothing for that. Never been there unless the pants I was had on where ultra old. ,Nov 2017,Jan 8 2018,0
9851,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,6, I have heard good things about duluth firehose pants for durability work pants. I don’t think they would be great for climbing. For climbing I would go with OR. I have had good luck with OR. I even have some prana pants that have held up well.  ,Jan 2015,Jan 8 2018,0
9852,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,7, Since you didn’t specify that it had to be an outdoor company I’m going to say that Ben Davis makes a solid pant. Stronger than dickies and lasts way longer. And you won’t lose stuff out your pockets every time you sit down.    My next suggestion is anything made with Duck Cloth. Such as Carhart or Duluth. Not going to be the lightest but may be the strongest. Great stuff for car camping but I wouldn’t backpack with it. I own a carhart insulated jacket and coveralls. Had them for almost 20 years and they’re still in great shape. ,Apr 2014,Jan 8 2018,0

9855,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,10, Thank you all very much for the responses. I'm definitely going to buy a pair of OR pants based on these recommendations~ although I should have mentioned that they don't need to be outdoor- or climbing-specific. I actually considered buying a pair of Nomex pants as I've found them to be indestructible~ but I can't get over having flame resistant pants without needing that feature. The baseball pants idea is actually genius~ never would have thought of that. I'll bet they're super comfy~ too. Thanks OLH for the repair tips. Have you or anyone had luck with Bituthene (sp?) patches or kevlar thread?,Jul 2014,Jan 8 2018,0

9858,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,13, I was disappointed with the durability of La Sportiva Solution pants~ which use a stretchy version of Cordura. I blew through the knees in less than a year of weekend warrior valley trips~ and the stitching in the pocket bags started to go as well.

I also third the Prana Zion suggestion--solid pants.,Jun 2016,Jan 8 2018,0
9864,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,19, OR pants are not great in general IMO.  I've had five pairs now: first gen. jeans and deadpoints both got rips all over the place~ fit is a bit odd (too short with a huge butt)~ and I've had zipper pulls just fall right off.  I wouldn't recommend them aside from their amazing return policy which lets me put up with their pants falling apart around me over and over...their Cirque pants on the other hands are absolutely amazing in almost every way (but those aren't the pants you're looking for...). ,Mar 2013,Jan 8 2018,0
9865,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,1,20, I have a 5-6 year old pair of Prana Zions~ other than a couple of tiny wear holes in the knees and a bit of ripped stitching on a back pocket~ they are 100% bomber. I will say however that subsequent pairs I've bought seem to be slightly less durable and slimmer fit~ but they are still great pants.,Apr 2012,Jan 8 2018,1
9866,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,0, I've had good luck with my 5.11 tac-lite pants.

9867,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,1, Forrest Carver wrote: I actually considered buying a pair of Nomex pants as I've found them to be indestructible~ but I can't get over having flame resistant pants without needing that feature. I wore Nomex pants firefighting all summer this year and didn't find them particularly indestructible. They are very abrasion resistant but tear easily and the seams aren't that well constructed. It was pretty common for either the cargo pockets to rip off or the crotch to rip open in the field. At least that was the case with the ones issued by the BC Wildfire Service (we have the best colours though~ red and blue ftw). They also get very rough and stiff when they've soaked up a week's worth of dirt and sweat (not sure if long term use without washing is a concern to you). Good luck,Aug 2017,Jan 8 2018,0
9868,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,2, I used the same single pair of Nomex pants for the 2010 and 2011 fire seasons and had great luck (not sure the brand but they were navy blue and we got them from Supply Cache.) One of the cargo pockets did rip off but it didn't affect the pant and I wound up just tearing the other one off as well as I never used them. They definitely did get pretty stiff after a two week roll~ although in civilization I would wash them occasionally~ haha Sounds like I need to try out the OR Ferrosi and Prana Zion. Thanks again for the responses~ and let me know if you have more patching/sewing tips for my dead garments,Jul 2014,Jan 8 2018,0
9869,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,3, You can also get some cheap ass wrangler jeans with some stretch from Target. For warmer days Prana Zion is where it's at (but not worth it if you pay full price~ they go on sale relatively often).,Jan 2016,Jan 8 2018,0
9870,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,4, I also recommend anything that uses Prana Stretch Zion.  I wore a pair of their shorts when I did a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail.  In 3 months and nearly 2200 miles of hiking~ butt-scooting~ and sitting in rocks the only damage they had was from a hole in the bottom of my pocket that steals my chapstick. I use them for climbing occasionally as well.  EVERYTHING else I've worn (Patagonia~ Mountain Hardwear~ The North Face~ and some mountain biking apparel company) have torn or ripped or lost a button/zipper within a year of weekend use.,Jul 2017,Jan 8 2018,0
9871,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,5, Also if you like the stretch zion but want to wear them not outside~ or you just don't want to look like a dork with cargo pockets. Then check out the Prana Brion pant. Same fabric slightly trimmer cut no dorky cargo pockets.,May 2014,Jan 8 2018,1
9872,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,2,6,  Thanks OLH for the repair tips. Have you or anyone had luck with Bituthene (sp?) patches or kevlar thread? No experience with what you mentioned. The quilt thread you get at fabric stores~ threatens to slice your hand before it breaks.  You can get sheets of iron on adhesive for fabric~ too~ and use those to make a patch or reinforcement out of any material you want. Or~ ya know~ have fun embellishing your pants with Holstein cows~ or whatever. Full disclosure~ I very rarely buy new stuff. I've had better luck at thrift stores~ because many more sizes/styles/brands show up there than any retail brick and mortar can ever carry. I'm very short~ but not tiny~ so I have to wade through ten pairs to get two. They are trash by the time I'm done~ as they start out suitable to wear to work jeans~ go out in public jeans~ climbing/camping jeans~ then finally painting and yard work stuff~ at which point dumpster diving would improve my wardrobe. Stretchy or baggy works for climbing~ just fine~ for me~ but I don't bend great anymore~ so.... Dunno what you have where you live~ but we have a business here that makes packs and such~ and they are ridiculously reasonable to get a heavy duty zipper replaced~ grommets~ metal stud buttons~ that sort of thing done. With the right equipment~ it's fast and easy. Without? Not so much.,Aug 2015,Jan 8 2018,2

That's a pretty good deal~ I'd do it. Though I will say I've ripped my Ferrosi's somewhat to shreds after about two years - though some of that comes from crampon tears and my own negligence.

The ""relaxed tapered"" fit is a similar fit to a jogger pants or sweatpants. Very baggy everywhere except the ankle. They are very heavy but highly abrasion resistant. They are made by the same company that makes the most heavy denim on the market- https://tateandyoko.com/products/naked-famous-weird-guy-super-heavyweight-32oz-selvedge-indigo?variant=496978505.....If you are unfamiliar with this type of denim~ it falls under the category of ""raw denim"". You basically get a rip in the jeans as a badge of honor~ like ""ya bro~ I just climb in these thats why I ripped them"". The more you wear them the more ""character"" they get in them~ similar to buying a pair of jeans that is already ripped and distressed.

I would like to try Duluth firehose pants but they start at 32 and I'm skinnier than that. I climb Alpine and ice in softshell pants~ usually Patagonia but sometimes Lowe.

The DuluthFlex Firehose pants are my favorite work pants I've used in the last 6-7 years. The flex makes all the difference but decreases their durability slightly..

9893,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,3,7, Had very good success with some MEC pants made of Schoeller fabric.  Bought them ~15 years ago~ and they're still going strong.  Use them in summer and don't overheat; use them in winter with a pair of biking tights underneath and am perfectly comfortable.  Use them for skiing~ alpine~ climbing~ whatever.  A couple of snags from cacti on a bushwack in Sedona and a nice crampon tear~ but even those didn't run.  Throw them in the wash every once in awhile and renew the DWR in the dryer.,Jan 2011,Apr 12 2020,0
9894,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,3,8, They just changed their cheaper models of softshell pant from Schoeller this year to something... inferior. I've got a pair which was previously made of Schoeller with great reviews that now is made of something else. I've climbed in them a few times (just in the gym) and they've already started to pill. No bueno. Super comfy but definitely not durable (and really short~ too!).,Mar 2013,Apr 13 2020,0
9895,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,3,9, Carhartt double front loggers~ the blue denim ones~ but with a caveat: suspenders. Im a carpenter/ranchhand/concrete countertop fabricator/installer~ and I used to blow the crotch of them way before the rest of the pant was worn out~ until I started wearing good~ heavy duty button-on suspenders. The part of the leg in front of the bottom of the pocket~ just above the double front~ is what now blows out first~ after 3x the wear~ though. I also carry way too much crap in my pockets; drill bits~ driver bits~ knives~ other tools~ etc.They used to sell the pants with the buttons attached~ but now they sell the buttons separately. They are “batchelor buttons” so no sewing necessary~ just a hammer. I actually prefer an awl and some channel locks~ though. Poke a hole~ squeeze them on. Wright’s suspenders~ in NW Washington State~ is a great small family company that makes awesome suspenders for loggers and firefighters. I’m only on my second pair~ with almost daily wear~ and I bought my first pair in ‘08 or ‘09~ and only bought my current pair last year.,Aug 2018,Apr 13 2020,1
9896,Most durable pants/pant material~ best repair options,3,10, Thanks for the further advice. In the 2 years since this topic I have gone through 2x pair of Ferrosi pants. I like them but they seem to run big and stretch out way too fast. I wear a 36 and the first pair I got was 36~ way too big in waist. So I got the 34s~ and within a year they were too big again. Now I have a pair of 32s and they work fine but they're skintight. Durability was fine. I am also trying a pair of the Duluth Firehose pants. So far they are great but I only have 6 months on them.

9901,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,0, I've been rapping off of rap rings for a long time~ for the usual reasons: cheaper than leaving behind a carabiner~ and lighter. But now I can buy a carabiner (BD Miniwire; $4.46 at Moosejaw) for only 50 cents more than the cheapest rap ring that I would rap off of (GM 5-pack; $3.95 on Amazon). It weighs less than the rap ring. It does more than the rap ring. I can easily clip through existing tat~ as well as my own webbing.  Why would I continue to use rap rings? Are folks uncomfortable that a single carabiner is not as closed a system as a rap ring?,May 2008,Apr 13 2020,2
9902,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,1," A bit of tape can turn your non-locker into a ""locked"" carabiner.  Keep some on the inside of your helmet and you'll always be prepared.   If you're putting these carabiners in a popular spot~ they're going to get taken.  I guess it comes down to if you're placing these for yourself or if you're trying to make the station solid enough that folks don't feel the need to add their own equipment.  ",Jun 2015,Apr 13 2020,12
9903,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,2, Good tip about the tape. I don't care if the carabiner get taken. The cost is (nearly) the same to me~ whether they take my carabiner or my rap ring.  Given that the cost is almost the same~ carabiners are as disposable as rap rings. Are rap rings obsolete?,May 2008,Apr 13 2020,1
9904,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,3, Are you talking about a rappel at the end of a route/pitch? Or a bail anchor? If you’re getting down from a climb where others might need to do the same~ I would expect a rap ring to stay in place longer. Other climbers will be more likely to add their own webbing/cord to the existing system if it looks rough~ instead of building something new.,Oct 2017,Apr 13 2020,9
9905,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,4, I've rapped off of a single biner before~ but it was free hanging and would not be levered open by rubbing on the rock.  I personally would like a closed system like a link of chain or a rap ring~ rather than a carabiner~ to rap from if the route is well travelled~ since you know the biner will be stolen.  If there is a rats nest with a ton of old tat~ I usually cut that shit off(save any hardware) and put my own cord on it anyway. Usually at an established rappel there will be a rap ring or link of chain or a quick link~ if there isn't~ I carry a Metolius rap ring just for that purpose.,Jul 2015,Apr 13 2020,1
9906,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,5, I can't give you a very good reason from a strength/safety standpoint why rapping off a single carabiner is safer than a single rap ring. That being said~ if I came to a rap station with 2 bolts~ some tat~ and a single biner~ I would feel a bit uneasy about it and would definitely be thinking about adding a second~ opposed biner.  I wouldn't think twice about the single rap ring.  ,Oct 2017,Apr 13 2020,1

9910,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,9, No reason to use a rings over decent biners. Usually the rings have more metal on them~ would take longer to groove or perhaps.But the real reason: Unfortunately some ignorant folks think any biner left on a wall is “booty.” It’s a state of mind that really needs a sea change. Biners left at wall anchors are there for the community~ much like the “cleaning biners” left on some really steep sport routes.There’s a special spot place in figurative hell for people who “booty” that stuff.  ,Aug 2013,Apr 13 2020,5
9911,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,10, Actually~ the cheapest option would be something like a Kong Oval QuickLink ($2 at MTN Shop).  But it's twice the weight of a BD MiniWire or rappel ring. Does slightly more than one thing. ,May 2008,Apr 13 2020,1

9913,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,12, I get the dual purpose nature of a biner~ but my gloves~ prussik and rap ring all ride on the same biner I clip to my haul loop.  The rap ring is really the best option to leave at a rap station. They are super beefy and will probably outlast you. They shouldn't get grooved just from a rope being pulled through them.,Jul 2015,Apr 13 2020,1
9914,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,13, I get you~ but I'm just not sure that longevity is the key issue for a piece of hardware that will be slung with webbing or cord outdoors. The webbing/cord will weather out long before the rap ring/carabiner wears out. Maybe at a super popular route~ but that's not what I'm rapping off of. As always~ it depends. . . ,May 2008,Apr 13 2020,0
9915,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,14, A tangent- A couple of the anchors we put in years ago on obscure routes  were 2 bolts~ a sling and a biner. When you go back in a few years the biner is gone because the sling wore through due high winds and rough rock.  ,Aug 2002,Apr 13 2020,0
9916,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,15, Much prefer biners at stations but if you’re leaving brand new biners someone will swap it out with an older one from their rack. Not that there’s anything wrong with that so long as it’s in ok shape. ,Nov 2006,Apr 13 2020,0
9917,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,16," You can get 5/16"" quick links for 75c~ which is more or less the equivalent of a rap ring. ",Jan 2016,Apr 13 2020,0
9918,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,17, Context is everything here. If it's an area with some traffic~ circular rings will last longer than quicklinks or biners because rings can rotate and don't concentrate the wear to one point. (Sometimes this doesn't work that well - we've all seen grooved rings.) If you favor the convenience of biners~ do it right and install steel biners or mussy hooks. And yes~ if we're talking about durability then get rid of the tat all together. What's the context of the route in OP? Two bolt anchor on single pitch? Tat on a tree? Bailing off stoppers on an alpine FA?,Aug 2014,Apr 13 2020,0

9920,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,19, My recommendation would be to carry some quick links and rap rings.  Remove all the tat from the anchors and install the quick links and rap rings.  Now you have a much better and probably safer anchor which no one has to mess with for years.  And~ you have given back to the climbing community to boot.,Apr 2003,Apr 13 2020,0
9921,Rap Rings vs. Carabiner~ revisited,1,20, Mostly Cochise Stronghold (AZ)~ new or low-traffic routes. Boulders~ horns~ chicken heads~ and trees.  In that case it seems prudent to steer this question towards CASA and see if they have any input.

9925,Fake Arcteryx?,1,3, The way the zipper slider is exposed when the zipper is closed doesn't seem right. Most good quality shells have a bit of fabric that the zipper slider tucks under when the zipper is closed~ to keep moisture from entering at the end of the zipper.

9926,Fake Arcteryx?,1,4, Fake I think in my opinion.  The tell tale sign Is that flap up the centre of the jacket.   Seems like a good fake though.   Look at the Dino~ they usually don't stitch it well.  And look at the tags~ they often cheap out there too. Word to the wise.. Look where you can't see.  Inside pockets~ behind zippers..  They try to make the outside look good~ but construct the jacket like shit.

9928,Fake Arcteryx?,1,6," I mean~ look at the panel colors. Arc't doesn't have any jackets with panels designed like that on their website~ so the jacket is not new.

9929,Fake Arcteryx?,1,7," I looked at a newer shell and you are correct~ no ""zipper garage"". The color mismatch between the zipper and the rest of the jacket still suggests a fake.

9964,Metolius Cam Question,1,4, Neither. It is an old Trango from the mid 90s. Actually a Korean cam that was sold under multiple brands~ Trango included. I have a whole set in my bin circa 1994~ but don’t feel like digging for them now. Pretty decent pieces imo. ,Feb 2012,Apr 12 2020,2

9972,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,0, Plan to start dirtbagging in July (when hopefully the whole pandemic slows down) and was thinking to get a Toyota Rav4 to convert into a camper. I know it comes with an AWD option but that seems more practical for snow than offroading and I don't plan to be driving in a lot of snow. I've also been eyeing the Tacoma and other awd cars/trucks but don't know how practical it would be to invest in awd. I like the rav4 because it's in my price range of <$15k~ reliable and more fuel efficient than most awd vehicles.  So do you need awd to get to a lot of climbing spots? I'll probably be spending more time on the western part of the US/Canada unless my path finds me more east.,Apr 2019,Apr 8 2020,0
9973,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,1, I think you can get to 98% of where you need to go with fwd and a bit of clearance. Buy some tire wires for winter:) when you are in an area that demands a serious vehicle- You can usually make a friend with one.,Sep 2017,Apr 8 2020,10

9975,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,3, Not necessary~ but AWD/4WD certainly helps when the road gets rowdy~ sandy~ or you encounter unexpected inclement weather. The peace of mind you get from a AWD vehicle outweighs the savings in fuel IMO.

9981,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,9, I had a big ol' Silverado I slept in for a couple months. Got that thing stuck constantly (rwd). Switched to a 4Runner which never got stuck but was a bit less comfy. Now I sleep in the fetal position in a Mazda3 sedan 'cause~ you know~ grad. school doesn't pay for itself. Good tires matter more than AWD IMO. I don't get stuck in really crappy conditions in my Mazda because I have really good tires on it. The amount of time you actually need AWD/4WD for cragging is really quite minimal both in Canada and the States. TLDR:  You pay far more for the image of capability than you'll actually use the capability. ,Mar 2013,Apr 8 2020,8

9983,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,11, I'd agree with ground clearance being more of an issue than 4x4 in my experience. though I've gotten my prius to some pretty rowdy places in the rockies so it's really up to you re: how much you're willing to crunch the bottom of your car,Jan 2019,Apr 8 2020,6
9984,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,12, I have awd and have greatly appreciated it in many circumstances (getting through mud roads in moab~ rock crawling~ passing i70 through vail after snow).

9985,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,13, Solid tires~ a bit of clearance~ and good driving tactics will most likely get you every where you want to go.

9986,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,14, I’ve gotten by with driving compact rental cars when I visit the west side of the country for climbing~ but there were definitely areas where we didn’t go because of the concerns about accessibility. Around here (RRG)~ you could either have a 4wd/good clearance car~ or you could post on MP every weekend hoping that someone will tell you about the up-to-date conditions of various hills. I personally wouldn’t consider a non-AWD vehicle as my “dirtbagging home”. But that’s just me. ,Mar 2011,Apr 8 2020,1
9987,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,15, Clearance is definitely more important than AWD. However~ the vehicles with more clearance are generally cars with AWD/4WD. I know you don't care about snow~ but for snow~ proper snow tires is 1000x more important than AWD.,Feb 2006,Apr 8 2020,4

9990,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,1,18, It really depends on where you are going~ what conditions you are expecting to encounter~ your willingness to hike access roads among many considerations. You can take a 2WD car down some gnarly tracks but these types of vehicles are not really built for this and they wear out much more quickly than a truck or body-on-frame SUV. My wife and I did quite a few road trips in her Maxima~ but by the time it died it was in bad shape and we probably could have gotten a few more years out of it if we had just stuck to pavement. In cars~ things like wheel bearings~ suspension components~ and the muffler (hangs low enough to catch or rocks and cattle grates) don't do so well off paved roads. You might save some money up front~ but if you are spending time in areas with a lot of dirt roads your repair costs will eventually offset these savings.  If you are going to well traveled crags and staying in developed campgrounds with minimal back road driving  you are probably fine with a front wheel drive car. Having a more rugged vehicle with higher clearance and good tires will open up more camping options~ particularly dispersed sites where you do not have to pay (e.g. Red Rocks~ City of Rocks~ Utah Desert). For what its worth I'd prioritize good tires first~ higher clearance second~ and AWD 3rd.  One other thing to consider is that ADW is good for some types of slick conditions like driving on the highway during a snow storm~ but is much less capable in many situations off pavement than a true 4x4.  AWD better than not having anything~ but if you want to check out some truly rough areas or drive back roads in muddy or snowy conditions something like a 4runner or Tacoma is a much better option. ,Mar 2010,Apr 8 2020,4

9995,Is AWD necessary for dirtbagging?,2,2," I've got a 4x4 Silverado. I rarely engage 4x4. The times I use 4x4 that come to mind are: driving on steep mountain roads covered in loose rock (think driving up a creek bed)~ driving in deep snow or parking on a snow covered shoulder~ and crawling over rock steps/boulders on otherwise decent dirt tracks. Only the snow examples have happened at ""normal"" crags. The other examples have all been scouting for new routes or just climbing way out in the desert where nobody goes. If you want to go to 95% of crags~ get something front wheel drive and more clearance than a sedan. If you want the piece of mind of having the extra traction in wet/snow~ get something with clearance and AWD.
