0,Have a hammock gear quilt right now,1
1,I really like it but am annoyed with the continous baffles and having to move the down each night before I go to bed,0
2,The down always seems to end up in the end of the baffles and it's a fair bit of work to get it back on top where I want it,0
3,I like the pad attachment system that Katabatic uses and was thinking of upgrading but curious if the down will do a better job staying put?,2
4,Do you roll or stuff the quilt when not in use? I have the HG Incubator and haven't had this problem,1
5,Gear with filled insulation like this should be stuffed instead of rolled to avoid pushing the insulation down to the ends I believe,1
6,Best of luck with your hang~,1
7,I stuff it and every night the down ends up at the ends of the baffles on the sides of the bag and has to be pushed back,0
8,It stays put if I spend 2 nights in the same place but there’s something about how I’m stuffing it I guess I have like 5 other bags including another HG bad and don’t have problems with any others,0
9,I've had one of the Katabatic 20 degree quilt for the last 6 years,2
10,No issues like you're describing with down bunching up,2
11,I use the tiny stuff sack it came with backpacking and there are no problems~ but for car camping I stuff it loosely in a reusable grocery bag just in case it prolongs the quilt's life,2
12,One of my favorite pieces of gear!,2
13,I know this is kind of old news~ but what is the general opinion of 5.10 shoes now that Adidas owns the brand? Specifically~ the new dragon lace ups and the rubber,1
14,Is stealth rubber still being used and is it still as sticky as before?,1
15,Adidas has owned 5.10 since 2011~ longer than most have been climbing.,1
16,I think overwhelmingly~ the change has hurt the brand,0
17,Shoes that people like are discontinued,0
18,Sizes can vary between manufacturing runs,0
19,New shoe designs underwhelming and under-performing compared to previously designed shoes,0
20,People are not sure about the rubber~ if its changed or not,0
21,The one big positive is they firesale them quite frequently,2
22,Meh,0
23,That may have been when there was a transaction but the major changes~ like closing the American production facilities and moving production to Asia started happening more recently,1
24," I dunno about the rubber~ but I have some moccs and while I like the fit they are already fraying in the ""leather"" around the edge after about 15-20 climbing days.",2
25,I wore guide tennis before and after Adidas took over~ and have noticed a huge decline in quality since the takeover,0
26,Whatever Adidas uses to glue the rubber to the bottom of the shoe started peeling off almost immediately~ and pretty soon the entire front end of the rubber becomes unglued and hangs there like a reverse flip-flop,0
27,This happened to two pairs in a row,0
28,After that~ I switched to Sportiva approach shoes~ which I've been happy with,2
29,Big issue with sizing changes and durability occurred when they moved production to Asia,0
30,They seem to quickly fall apart and wear under normal use now.,0
31,same story here with approach shoes,1
32,#fakenews,1
33,Sizing from adidas is a huge issue - if I find a pair that fits me in a store~ maybe I'll buy them~ but maybe not~ because I'll never be able to get a second pair of the same shoe~ back to the starting line of finding a pair of shoes I like,0
34,Certainly will never order another pair again~ as there's no telling what actual size will come in the mail~,0
35,That includes approach shoes,1
36,It's worth remention that a bunch of five.ten employees went and started the company Unparallel recently,1
37,I had one pair until they were stolen~ and I was super impressed with the quality and the rubber,2
38,I'll buy those again.,2
39,I never had the american made shoes~ but the Adidas 5.10 shoes I have tried have been less than impressive in terms of quality compared to the Italian brands,0
40,My own previous snarkiness aside~ I’ve experienced and observed more Sportiva quality issues than any other brand,0
41,I haven’t bought a new pair of hiangles in a couple years~ but I’ve never had 5.10 issues myself.,2
42,Yeah I would say of the major brands~ the biggest QC issues have been Evolv and La Sportiva,0
43,TC Pro delams~ Miura toe blowouts in 2 months...they’re pretty infamous for it,0
44,The Five Tens I’ve owned have all been top notch in construction,2
45,Only owned one pair of Scarpas but they’ve impressed me~ even though they don’t fit my feet that great.,2
46,Same here,1
47,I haven't been climbing long enough to have used 'American' 5.10~ but after being disappointed with the Adidas Pink Anasazi I bought the Unparallel UP Lace and I've been using them for maybe 6 months or so,0
48,I'll probably buy another pair soon too~ as my current ones are getting a bit too comfy to the detriment of performance.,0
49,I’ve been using 5.10 since they started and during the transition to Adidas,1
50,I recently bought a pair of Grandstones and have to say they are the best built pair of shoes I’ve ever bought from them~ very high quality build,2
51,And BTW~ they are still using C4 the same sticky rubber,1
52,I have some guide tennies from before and after the factory shut down (seemingly where the issues started~ not the change of ownership),0
53,The ones before the shut down are older~ more used and..,0
54,in SIGNIFICANTLY better condition,2
55,The ones purchased almost a year later are already all but useless with the bottom rubber almost completely detached,0
56,I will say I talked to an adidas rep who said they tried pretty hard to change the C4 rubber (trying to make it more eco friendly) but could not do it,0
57,So supposedly it is the same rubber,1
58,FWIW~ I love my 5.10 Quantum lace-ups and the Stealth rubber that they used,2
59,It lasted me about 6 months and I am now about to send them in to be resoled,1
60,However~ I have found that 5.10/Adidas is absolute dog shit when it comes to customer service,0
61,It has taken them 2-3 days to even ship shoes that I have bought through their super sale and~ even then~ shipping is slow (always more than a week from shipping date in my experience),0
62,Additionally~ I ordered a couple pairs of Team VXIs which just didn't fit my foot well and~ despite them having received the shoes~ I have not heard anything regarding my refund,0
63,Bottom line: love the shoes~ not the customer service,2
64,Buy em from literally any retailer other than Adidas themselves,0
65,I think any current 5.10 issues were also present before Adidas bought them~ sizing and quality included,0
66,If anything they may have improved in some ways with the support of the larger company,2
67,Haven't heard any current complaints regarding a drop in the rubber quality,2
68,For every 5.10 complaint I've heard regarding delaminating~ I've heard one for Sportiva as well,1
69,5.10 quality was always inferior to the European shoe makers,0
70,It is the Dodge Charger of climbing shoe companies and always was,0
71,Adidas buying them was like Fiat buying Chrysler - SOS.,0
72,Delam issues are not always the manufacturers fault,1
73,Shoes get abused~ they get thrown in the back of a car and sit it the hot sun and bake,1
74,They get wet from sweat and then thrown into the bottom of a pack and then 30lbs of gear gets loaded on top and then we wonder why my shoes are starting to delaminate,1
75,Take care of you shoes,1
76,It’s like to new climber who’s shoes are blown out in the toe after a month and they complain that it’s a manufacturer defect when it’s clearly poor footwork,1
77,I’ve never had a pair of Five Ten climbing shoes delam and I’ve been using them since Five Ten started,2
78,I have had one pair of Guide Tennies start to delam but that was quickly fixed with a bit of super glue gel,0
79,I'm old...53 to be exact~ and I have not had any issues with my multiple 5.10 shoes: Spires~ Pinks~ Coyotes and Gambits (and more that I can't remember),0
80,But they were all made in the USA and have all had many resoles,2
81,The Coyotes are about done~ the inside liner is all but gone and the leather is wearing through from the inside,0
82,Fantastic smearing shoe IMO,2
83,The highest quality shoe I've ever had is the Boreal Ballet Gold~ they are just a really well made shoe,2
84,Lots of stitching and rubber~ in the right places~ to make the shoes super durable,2
85,I go through a lot of laces~ because these are crack shoes,0
86,I also own the Boreal Ninja~ which also are super well made,2
87,La Sportiva is more hit and miss,0
88,My Cobras only took two resoles before they were toast,0
89,My Mythos on the other hand have been resoled at least four times~ maybe 5,2
90,My Kaukulators were the same way....many many resoles before the leather ripped,2
91,My first pair was orange~ I remember that~ long gone~ but lasted a few seasons,1
92,Only pair of Scarpa I ever had was the Helix~ not that great a shoe IMO,0
93,I don't climb much severely overhanging stuff~ or pockets~ so I don't really have a need for a super aggressive shoe~ so maybe my choice of shoes just last longer than others.,1
94,Strongly disagree,0
95,I used to order 1-2 pairs of the same darn size of Ansazi Velcros  every year for years and years~ and got the same shoe every time~ from 2002ish? to 2012,2
96,I could take them out of the box~ throw them in the pack~ and wear them 1st time at a cliff~ always the very same shoe.,2
97,I started using 5.10 in 1996,1
98,Before that I had a few pairs of Boreals (Vector/Laser/Ballet)~ Scarpas (Rockmaster)~ Asolos (Opera) and La Sportivas (Kendo/SuperX/Ballerina/Mythos),1
99,In 5.10~ before Adidas took over~ I used the Razor (best shoe ever)~ VX~ UFO~ RockSox~ Moccs~ and Ansazi lace and Velcro,1
100,Since 2011~ I've had several pairs of Dragons~ various Anasazis~ as well as a couple pairs of Quantums~ HiAngles and Arrowheads,1
101,Before 2012 or so~ I had absolutely no issues with sizing in 5.10~ and I could find them in a store and actually try them on,2
102,Since about that time frame~ the sizing seems to be all over the place~ and since it seems like no store carries the brand any longer~ it is basically a complete lottery whether the pair I ordered will fit or not,0
103,I have had size 7 fit perfectly~ but then I wasn't able to get an 8 on my feet at all~ and I have (somewhat) comfortably worn 5.10 anywhere from size 6.5 to 8.5,0
104,This is really unfortunate~ and I have started to drift to Sportiva as result,0
105,Though they don't fit quite as well~ the sizing is more consistent than 5.10~ and they have better rubber than Boreal,2
106,As for 5.10 quality issues~ I have had none outside of a pair of Anasazi Pinks literally splitting in apart at the heel after three days of use,0
107,Customer service was completely unresponsive when I tried to warranty them~ so that wasn't that great either,0
108,I did have the same thing happen on a pair of VXs~ but that was after a resole~ and they were a super light weight shoe that 5.10 made for only 1 year in the late 90s.,0
109,Second this comment,1
110,Guide Tennis were my favorite and only approach shoe,2
111,My last purchase (maybe 2.5 years ago) the sole came off within the first season,0
112,Send them back~ got a new pair~ happened again,0
113,I switched to Sportivas as well and have been very  happy!,2
114,I know a few sponsored climbers and apparently a former rep who all feel that the rubber is not the same,0
115,The new Adidas factory has only been producing shoes for about the past 9 months and not all retailers have the new stock,0
116,There is a very stark difference between the new and old Hiangle construction,0
117,You can tell if you have the new ones as the toe hook rubber is thinner and inside the shoe there is a horizontal seam near the midsole,0
118,Also~ the label is different,1
119,I loved my old Five Tens so much that I stockpiled many of them,2
120,The Teams never changed nor did the old Dragons,2
121,The new Hiangles feel uber stiff and insensitive and the heel fits differently (better for me~ doesn't bag out),2
122,I loved that the Hiangle had some stiffness~ but you could still microadjust and pull with the toes,2
123,The newest ones I have feel a lot like an Instinct VS or Solution when new~ but both of those shoes break in quicker and better,2
124,I don't feel that the rubber is as sticky,0
125,The Aleon is a love/hate,0
126,Most people I know like the heel for its fit~ but not for heel hooking,2
127,The stretchiness of the upper means you have to really crank the velcro for it not to move during heel hooks~ but it won't pull off,2
128,The main issue is the toebox can be love/hate,0
129,It is one of the only toeboxes that pushes the big toe inwards and it is almost diamond shaped rather than a talon like the Dragon or Solution and for some it just never gets comfortable,0
130,You can see my other posts about the Dragons~ but almost no sponsored climbers are wearing the shoe and very few normal people I have met seem to like it,0
131,While the build quality is higher~ the design isn't there,0
132,They feel more like an Evolv than a Five Ten,1
133,Let's be honest- no one ever bought Five Ten for durability,0
134,They were designed to perform and be comfortable on granite for the most part and they don't do that very well anymore.,0
135,I generally like 5.10 shoes and have owned many different pairs over the years~ but my experience with them lately (like last 6 months) has been awful,0
136,I've sent at least 5 pairs of shoes back due to sizing issues,0
137,And just to add insult to injury~ I got a pair of Hiangles from the recent sale that fit but one of the shoes they sent has exposed stitching and is delaminating on the side,0
138,I would've been done with them long ago but I'm trying to use a gift certificate..,0
139,super frustrating.,0
140,Interesting to find this thread because I have been wondering about this,1
141,Have been using 5.10 products for over 30 years and they have ALWAYS had quality and sizing issues,0
142,They have also pretty much been the high-performance standard even with said issues,2
143,Sad to hear people think they are getting worse,0
144,I found this thread while searching for 5.10's new website to buy some new shoes,1
145,Yikes,0
146,Pic up some Acopa’s instead.,2
147,Been climbing in 5.10 shoes for about 10 years,2
148,Love my pinks~ quantums and mocs,2
149,"I bought a pair of quantum velcros and loved them~ so I bought another pair~ which are 1/4"" smaller",2
150,I haven't been able to break them in,0
151,Concerned about size issues~ too.,0
152,I was just thinking about this,1
153,A factor two falls puts a much higher shock on the climber and the anchor system than a factor one fall,1
154,"But a ""soft"" catch~ such as was required before modern climbing ropes were invented~ would reduce these forces to something safer",1
155,"A soft catch is tricky to practice~ however~ which is why in the pre-modern-rope era there was the saying~ ""the leader must not fall."" But~ what if there was a device like a Grigri that had a ""soft catch"" mode that would gradually (but obviously very quickly) slow the fall~ thus reducing peak forces on the anchor to something safe? Ideally this mode could be quickly shut off by flicking a switch in the device after pro is placed above the anchor",1
156,Any thoughts on this?,1
157,1/10 Soft catches are overrated in the outdoors unless you are climbing some bad ass overhang route.,1
158,Is this a troll comment?,1
159,Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week,1
160,To get the precision required to do a soft catch correctly in different circumstances you need a computer,1
161,Our brains are that computer,1
162,I think that building a purely mechanical device that could perform a soft catch and was also simple and reliable enough to use for everyday belaying would be very challenging,0
163,Plus it would probably do the wrong thing most of the time.,0
164,Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week Next week doesn't help much~ but if someone could spike me into next year~ that would be great,1
165,I think I have had enough of 2020.,1
166,Even with our brains computing the forces there isn’t much you can do to soften a FF2 fall when using a Grigri,1
167,The OP had the idea that the soft catch feature could be turned off,1
168,You are only in  FF2 territory until the first clip is made~ then shift into normal belay mode,1
169,I agree it would be a challenge to make the device but the concept is interesting,1
170,Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week Can you explain how spiking happens on a less than overhanging route?,1
171,Better to just install autobelays on all outdoor routes and slowly lower everyone when they fall,1
172,thats what the rope is for,1
173,you can also modify your belay geometry to eliminate factor 2 fall,1
174,Who is taking factor 2 falls routinely? Who is even taking factor 1 falls routinely? Most lead falls are like factor 0.5 or less~ unless you've done something really~ really wrong,1
175,What you're talking about could only happen in those first few feet between leaving an anchor and placing your first piece on a multipitch,1
176,And that's only if the multipitch is actually steep and vertical,1
177,The follower should be connected to the anchor with their rope~ which will help to absorb the shock,1
178,Can you explain how spiking happens on a less than overhanging route? Climber falls~ and the belayer~ a sadist~ sits back into their harness as hard they possibly can - just as the climber's weight comes onto the rope.,1
179,I don't think they can make it,1
180,It is either locked or open,1
181,Any engineers out there?,1
182,Trango Cinch?,1
183,I think the answer is similar to the answer to the question “Why aren’t Yates Screamer dogbones more popular?” The market doesn’t demand a supply,1
184,As a moot/academic discussion~ though~ I’d be curious to hear your design constraints/requirements/ideas you would suggest for the device~ though..,1
185,What kind of impact/force reduction is already offered by an ATC~ pilot~ megajul~ gri-gri~ cinch~ revo~ whatever..,1
186,Have you considered the impact-reduction provided by dynamic rope stretch in a factor 2 fall? How does that compare to the potential reduction of maximum force you’d be looking to achieve via the device?,1
187,Is this a troll comment?   Dear RRG climbers..,1
188,The RRG is basically a gym.,1
189,Climber falls~ and the belayer~ a sadist~ sits back into their harness as hard they possibly can - just as the climber's weight comes onto the rope,1
190,I'll make this easy for you~ Artem,1
191,"In a less than OVERHANGING fall gravity~ not the sadistic belayer~ is what ""slams"" you into the wall",1
192,!/  instead of /! where the climber is !,1
193,Best bet in any less than overhanging fall is to put the brakes on it ASAP,1
194," In an overhanging situation where you're run out a bit it's the pendulum of you swinging back into the wall that ""spikes"" you and where a ""soft catch"" can be helpful",1
195,Sounds complex~ I'm trying to think of what sort of mechanism could give you a reliable soft catch,1
196,Hmm...,1
197,I guess you could have a mechanism that releases the GriGri a little~ just like the lever does~ when the device is pulled away from the belayer using a spring or something,1
198,If the spring is set so it takes~ say~ a few kN to pull it there you go,1
199,Maybe it could even be a thing you put on a regular GriGri rather than a new device,1
200,"Though~ I feel like most of the chill trad routes I do have a place to get a bomber ""Jesus piece"" in coming off the belay~ so it's not hard to minimize the chance of a factor two fall",1
201,How many routes out there have belays where you can't really avoid being in a factor two situation?,1
202,That's not what spiking is.,1
203,I'll make this easy for you~ Artem,1
204,"In an overhanging situation where you're run out a bit it's the pendulum of you swinging back into the wall that ""spikes"" you and where a ""soft catch"" can be helpful",1
205,A good belayer can give you a soft catch by moving with the pull of the rope and will decrease the force on the climber as they fall,1
206,A bad belayer will sit back and mess you up by increasing the speed of the swing you take into the wall,1
207,It blows my mind how many people don't understand what a soft catch is and how to give one,1
208,Normally it's either noobs who are in their first few seasons or crusty trad dads that catch one fall per season that deal most of the worst spikes I've seen.,1
209,The mountain project like count may agree with you,1
210,The laws of physics do not.,1
211,I'm seconding this because the original quote has 12 misinformed likes and counting,1
212," Besides that~ the ""soft catch"" proposal for Grigris isn't about spiking the faller~ it is about reducing the maximum impact load to the gear and team",1
213,That happens because some fall energy is dissipated by friction when the rope is allowed to run under tension,1
214,Spiking is a result of penduluming into the wall on a very short fall on overhanging ground,1
215,Lengthening the fall puts the overhanging wall further away and allows the leader to hit with reduced impact as their pendulum crosses the vertical and starts ascending,1
216,On less than vertical ground~ the pendulum never crosses the vertical (obviously) so there is no impact reduction~ and meanwhile adding length to the fall risks smacking the falling leader into features or ledges.,1
217,"""Right~ because we all know that in less than overhanging terrain the best policy is to spike your climber into next week"" Now~ I suppose you're correct that 90 degrees is 1 degree LESS THAN OVERHANGING",1
218,So~ yeah~ for all those exactly VERTICAL climbs with no obstacles sticking out of the face you are correct,1
219,"In most of the real world of climbing~ though~ ""less than overhanging"" means ""less than vertical."" Don't go soft-catching anyone on slab",1
220,Or blocky alpine terrain,1
221,Or a 5.9 Royal Robbins classic like The Open Book,1
222,You'll break your climber's legs or worse,1
223,On less than vertical ground~ the pendulum never crosses the vertical (obviously) so there is no impact reduction~ and meanwhile adding length to the fall risks smacking the falling leader into features or ledges,1
224,Most of the ledge falls I've seen are belayers giving their climbers hard catches and swinging them straight into a ledge that they would have otherwise fallen right past,1
225,Even a small feature can ruin your talus bones/ankles with a bad belay.,1
226,Most of the ledge falls I've seen are belayers giving their climbers hard catches and swinging them straight into a ledge that they would have otherwise fallen past,1
227,"  Note above~ ""small jump."" ",1
228,Don't go soft-catching anyone on slab,1
229,Way to make a strawman by moving the goal posts to slab lol,1
230," Note above~ ""small jump.""  If you are above a huge ledge that you won't fall past - then this is a special situation where a tight belay would be warranted",1
231,This is relatively rare and a good belayer will know when to do it,1
232,Hard catches should never be a one size fits all policy,1
233,How about a Munter?,1
234,Spiking is a result of penduluming into the wall on a very short fall on overhanging ground,1
235,For the people liking Artem's posts: Read the bold part and take the time to understand it.,1
236,For the people liking Artem's posts: Read the bold part and take the time to understand it,1
237,A soft catch will reduce the speed of the climber before they come in contact with the wall - a hard catch won't do this and more deceleration will occur when the climber comes into contact with the wall (this rapid deceleration is what causes the injury),1
238,You will always have flight time before you touch the wall on a vertical wall (less than overhanging) - the only time you wouldn't is if you are on a slab (less than vertical).,1
239,Artem~ This youtube video demonstrates your point pretty well.youtube.com/watch?v=_0GGsBg…  Even when the climbers tie-in is only .5 m from the vertical point of the pendulum the speed at impact was substantially lower using a soft catch,1
240,It also appeared to be lower well before the vertical point of the pendulum~ although they don't put numbers on the screen for that.,1
241,Soft Catches are stupid~ just don't keep people too tight or too loose,1
242,They'll be fine.,1
243,I think you missed a crucial point,1
244,"The discussion here has been about ""less than overhanging"" climbs",1
245,Nobody has disputed that a soft catch on overhanging climbs is a nice feature and can keep a climber from swinging back into the wall/rock.,1
246,This video also doesn't represent the technique in a soft catch~ because the belayer is static~ they are just adding slack to the system,1
247,That is not how a soft catch works.,1
248,No~ I didn't miss that point,1
249,I looked up the video because I essentially agree with you from a physics perspective~ but it doesn't align with my personal experience,1
250,The portion of the video where the climber is 0.5 m from the pendulum point models a vertical~ not overhanging~ route pretty well (IMO),1
251,My ass is often 1.5 feet from the wall when climbing~ and if I fall doing something dynamic I would imagine it could end up out even farther than that,1
252,The video concludes - through mathematical analysis and empirical modeling - that climber speed as they impact the wall is lower with a soft catch in that situation,1
253,The data shown when demonstrating this convinced me that the same would be true on a slightly slabby route,1
254,That is not how a soft catch works,1
255,It's pretty clear here that you haven't actually watched the video.,1
256,It's pretty clear here that you haven't actually watched the video,1
257,That is why I went back to finish it,1
258,Their early examples were terrible,0
259,But I agree that a soft catch is a good thing in most circumstances,2
260,A soft catch will reduce the speed of the climber before they come in contact with the wall - a hard catch won't do this and more deceleration will occur when the climber comes into contact with the wall (this rapid deceleration is what causes the injury),1
261,You will always have flight time before you touch the wall on a vertical wall (less than overhanging) - the only time you wouldn't is if you are on a slab (less than vertical),1
262,"Any physics professor would tell you that your first paragraph is gibberish (and the rest isn't even relevant to a fall on a dynamic rope.) The force of the rope catching the climber is not a material ""impact."" The static rope analogy is irrelevant because we don't climb on static ropes",1
263,The dynamic properties of the rope are more than adequate to eliminate any risk of injury due to the forces of the rope catching the fall,1
264,"The dynamic rope will make the ""catch"" part of the catch soft enough",1
265,On a high fall factor fall you may feel the rope catching you hard~ but it can't hurt you,1
266,Dynamic ropes are specifically engineered to eliminate that risk.,1
267,That is why I went back to finish it,1
268,When would a soft catch be bad then?,1
269,When would a soft catch be bad then? That catch should match the terrain~ the gear~ the belayer/climber weight ratio~ and a number of other factors that most gumbies cannot understand,1
270,But hopefully with a good in person tutor~ they can move beyond gumbyland and figure these things out,1
271,That catch should match the terrain~ the gear~ the belayer/climber weight ratio~ and a number of other factors that most gumbies cannot understand,1
272,Please speak Gumby,1
273,So when is a soft catch bad?,1
274,Please speak Gumby,1
275," So when is a soft catch bad? You have already stated that for you ""Soft catches are overrated in the outdoors unless you are climbing some bad ass overhang route.""  Stick with your gym climbing and trolling",1
276,TRE Sirius was designed to slip a bit and mimic the behavior of a Munter,1
277,By far my favorite belay devices~ but out of production a very long time at this point.,1
278,Artem~ I figured out the disconnect,1
279,"You're taking ""less than overhanging"" to ONLY mean plumb vertical",1
280,"The rest of us are taking ""less than overhanging"" to mean~ well~ all climbs that are LESS THAN OVERHANGING",1
281,That means everything from some 5.2 beginner trad route to big portions of even El Cap,1
282,Here's what's missing in the video~ IMO: She's falling into empty space,1
283,Put an 85 degree angle of granite under her and redo it,1
284,Then let's talk,1
285,Artem~ I figured out the disconnect,1
286,Even plumb vertical isn't going to change the parameters much,1
287,"Once again~ rgold nailed it: ""on less than vertical ground~ [or even plumb vertical] the pendulum never crosses the vertical""",1
288,Haha~ especially at the end when they say if you are doing trad climbing~ forget everything we said,1
289,(But~ actually~  some of it should be relevant...),1
290,Even plumb vertical isn't going to change the parameters much,1
291,"Once again~ rgold nailed it: ""on less than vertical ground~ [or even plumb vertical] the pendulum never crosses the vertical"" No need to make it personal",1
292,"I'll be the first to admit I'm not versed in the physics~ but in my experience~ on a vertical wall I much prefer a moderately soft catch if there is nothing to hit (I suppose we could debate ad nauseam what constitutes a ""feature~"" but I'm thinking of climbing in the 5.10/11 and up range~ so fairly small holds",1
293,A ledge~ even a small one~ would change the calculus,1
294,"We could also debate ad nauseam what constitutes a ""moderately"" soft catch)",1
295,Most of my partners agree~ and that's the kind of catch I will give them~ or anyone in such a scenario unless they explicitly request otherwise,1
296,"The alternative--a hard lock-off--results in~ not necessarily a ""spike~"" but at the least~ uncomfortable impacts on vertical walls.",1
297,When would a soft catch be bad then? When the extra length of the fall would cause the leader to hit a ledge or the ground or other feature.,1
298,So a munter then..,1
299,Well at least it’s free.,1
300,Grigris kill.,0
301,Figuring out a “send” mode for climbing shoes sounds just as possible and far more useful.,1
302,"(But~ actually~  some of it should be relevant...) If this post from a Mathematics University Professeur (also with his long-time practical experience in climbing which is many more years than most of us have been alive) does not end this discussion on ""soft-catch"" (and he even acknowledges that under ideal circumstances it might just be better) then there is no way that you are open to changing your mind.",1
303,Didn’t someone ask years ago~ “Why can’t belay devices have an idiot mode?”  And thus the Gri Gri was born,2
304,Don’t push your luck,1
305,Lol,1
306,As someone who's climbed a lot of steep stuff in the Red but also a lot of vert and slab in NC~ I almost always give and prefer to receive a soft catch,1
307,I don't know what people are talking about when they say you should give a hard catch on slab,1
308,I've taken plenty of slab falls~ and the ones that suck the most are when I get a hard catch,1
309,On everything but very low angle friction slab you're usually falling slightly away from the wall~ and a hard catch increases the impact into the wall,1
310,On vertical terrain I couldn't imagine thinking a hard catch is better~ you're falling away from the wall and you're going to swing back in so it'd be dumb to make that swing fast and short with a hard catch,1
311,Honestly~ I sometimes prefer a hard catch on really steep stuff because I'm not gonna hit anything but air anyway~ and it makes it less work to boink back up,1
312,The Grigri 7,1
313,No need to make it personal,1
314,"The alternative--a hard lock-off--results in~ not necessarily a ""spike~"" but at the least~ uncomfortable impacts on vertical walls",1
315,"I think the folks screaming ""I wouldn't let person X belay me"" are the ones making it personal",1
316,"And phrases like ""spike into next week"" are the spray.",1
317,There are many ways a climber can get spiked on a 'vertical' route,1
318,Admittedly~ probably not as hard as on an overhung route~ but it can still happen,1
319,Climber could fall while doing a move that requires lots of outward force such as a layback or pulling on an undercling with smeared feet,1
320,Another scenario is anytime you're not directly above your last pro such as on a traverse,1
321,Traversing out of a corner would essentially be the same as a roof.,1
322,Traversing out of a corner would essentially be the same as a roof,1
323,Injuries are caused by kinetic energy,1
324,Counterpressure moves are very unlikely to contribute enough energy into the system to cause injury.,1
325,You can absolutely spike somebody on a vertical wall - since you fall out and then back in,1
326,A hard catch will swing you into the wall violently~ while a soft catch will absorb most of the speed of a fall before you touch the wall,1
327,Why are you pushing off the wall when you fall? Don't blame your belayer just because you don't know how to fall properly,1
328,Why are you pushing off the wall when you fall? Don't blame your belayer just because you don't know how to fall properly This response is amusing,1
329,"Have you ever fallen off of a vertical wall? You don't need to ""push"" to fall outwards - you will always come off the wall and then come back into the wall~ no matter what you do",1
330,"And generally~ to ""push"" off the wall~ you have to fall intentionally~ which is something I don't do - since this is a mistake newer/less practiced climbers will make when they are scared and unwilling to keep climbing",1
331,I typically fall when either going for the next move and missing~ or from a spontaneous foot slip,1
332," You don't need to ""push"" to fall outwards",1
333,If you are moving outwards~ something needs to push,1
334,What is this mysterious force that causes some climbers to fall horizontally outwards?,1
335,What is this mysterious force that causes some climbers to fall horizontally outwards? You're telling me that on a perfectly vertical wall~ you'll fall down~ flush with the wall and scrape it the entire way? Lol,1
336,Your responses have been pretty absurd so far~ but now I am dying to see you demonstrate this master falling technique,1
337,This response is amusing,1
338,So~ you fall when you miss whatever move you were trying (aka a mistake; something you are claiming you don't do),1
339,Have you thought that maybe you missed that move because you were incorrectly pushing off the wall with your feet our pulling out on a hold with your hand? So~again~ don't blame your belayer because you made a mistake.,1
340,You're telling me that on a perfectly vertical wall~ you'll fall down~ flush with the wall and scrape it the entire way? Lol,1
341,Your responses have been pretty absurd so far~ but now I am dying to see you demonstrate this Only our hands and feet are in contact with the wall,1
342,Our center of gravity (basically our hips) is always away from the rock (at most by about the length of our arms which can be about two feet~ but rarely does one fall just as their arms are completely extended horizontally.) On a plumb vertical wall our center of gravity is typically about a foot from the wall,1
343,I have inadvertently done it,1
344,Lightweight climber (~100lbs)~ heavier belayer (~160lbs),1
345,Climber was approximately .5m above the bolt~ with about 10m of rope in service,1
346,Granite slab climb~ just less than vertical with a short crux of almost vertical terrain,1
347,Climber fell and I gave an unintentional hard catch,1
348,The climber fell out slightly from the wall then the rope came tight and she accelerated into the wall and twisted her ankle.,1
349,"What is this mysterious force that causes some climbers to fall horizontally outwards? My impression is that the ""mysterious force"" you are asking about depends on the mechanics of falling",1
350,If your hand pops off and your feet stay on~ you will tilt back slightly as you fall,1
351,Have you thought that maybe you missed that move because you were incorrectly pushing off the wall with your feet our pulling out on a hold with your hand? So~again~ don't blame your belayer because you made a mistake,1
352,This response is so blatantly obtuse and disingenuous - but yes~ please continue giving me lessons on technique despite you at best being a 5.10 sport climber :),1
353,Only our hands and feet are in contact with the wall,1
354,There absolutely can be and often is an outward component to climbing a vertical face,1
355,Are you only pulling straight down when you climb or are you exerting an outward component to your pull? If you are pulling out some~ what are our feet doing? Now~ what are your feet doing when hands~ that have some outward pull~ pop off the holds,1
356,I don’t know much about the physics~ but anyone who has actually taken or even caught enough falls on vertical terrain can attest to the potential for spiking~ especially if you’re a lighter climber,1
357,If your physics model doesn’t come up with this then I question whether the model is correct.,1
358,If your physics model doesn’t come up with this then I question whether the model is correct.,1
359,Our center of gravity (basically our hips) is always away from the rock (at most by about the length of our arms which can be about two feet~ but rarely does one fall just as their arms are completely extended horizontally.)  Would you do this little experiment next time you are climbing a vertical wall,1
360,He’s not the one modeling what forces the climber is applying.,1
361,Would you do this little experiment next time you are climbing a vertical wall Dude~ you're right! A force that no one can explain pushed me away from the wall just as I fell!,1
362,This response is so blatantly obtuse and disingenuous - but yes~ please continue giving me lessons on technique despite you being a 5.10 sport climber :)  You are right about my abilities,1
363,I don't chase grades but have been pushing into the 11's lately with a new gym opening with a great setter,1
364,But~ I still don't see why I need to climb at such an elite level as you to know how to fall properly,1
365,But~ what does my tick list have to do with physics or this discussion? If anything~ it will tell the average climber that I spend more time on low angle/vertical terrain than you do where the types of falls in question happen~ since generally~ the higher in grades you get in sport~ the more overhanging it is~ right? I'm not the one blaming everyone else for my mistakes,1
366,Look at your post history~ you have a tendency to do just that.,1
367,There's really only one expert for physics questions:,1
368,I've only ever fallen straight down a climb once,1
369,Slightly less than vert~ spead eage with tenuous holds and a foot popped~ causing the hands to pop~ and down I slid,1
370,On anything near vert~ you will almost always have an outward force because you are pulling down and out at some vector,1
371,Plus~ it would suck to fall directly down~ hitting your pro/bolts and getting tangled in the rope,1
372,Typically it is a hand that gives out~ causing a pivot outwards ad your feet are briefly still on a hold or 2~ IME,1
373,Some of the worst falls I've had are knees at pro~ lower on a route~ with a quick swing into the rock,1
374,I don't think a soft catch would be timed correctly~ but having a little extra rope out seems to help,1
375,Very small holds on off vert slab might be different~ but I'm too scared (or scarred) to fall.,1
376,I'm not the one blaming everyone else for my mistakes,1
377,Look at your post history~ you have a tendency to do just that,1
378,Lol~ what a bold and baseless accusation,1
379,Feel free to provide some examples,1
380,I remember our last interaction was you trying to blame me for being dropped by my belayer (a gym employee dropping me in a gym - and then also faulting me for knowing other climbers who had also been dropped at some point in their careers),1
381,That was a nasty interaction that left me with a rather bad impression of you,1
382,You are right about my abilities,1
383,If you fall straight down a vert wall in a gym..,1
384,well~ I think you would only do that once,1
385,You will purposefully put some outward momentum into your fall (it will be there even if you don't) to avoid breaking your ankles on the way down.,1
386,I’ll certainly take the opinion of someone who has taken and/or held hundreds/thousands of falls before listening to the opinion of a physics expert who has taken/caught very few,1
387,Now if you happen to be both...that’s even better.,1
388,Lol~ what a bold and baseless accusation,1
389,You are the same Artem who got a college degree because everyone else told you to do it and then wanted to default on your loans right?,1
390,You are the same Artem who got a college degree because everyone else told you to do it and then wanted to default on your loans right? Ooh buddy - you had to go all the way back to my first posts on this forum (over 900 posts ago) and even then you couldn't come up with a proper example,1
391,And yes~ I'd still default on my private loans if it means the difference between buying groceries and paying for my loans,1
392,Quite a few young people are in the same predicament as me in today's America,1
393,Thanks.,1
394,I think the whole debate has assumed semi-religious overtones with neither side wanting to give ground,1
395,It occurs against the background of the sometimes contentious trad-sport arguments~ with each side claiming superior knowledge the other side doesn't have~ this in spite of the fact that many people do both types of climbing,1
396,It has been established that when hard-locking belay devices like the Grigri are employed~ properly-timed soft catches can reduce impacts to the anchor,1
397," In fact~ the entire soft-catch concept took hold because of the ""hardness"" of the autolocking belay",1
398,The variability in the effectiveness remains an unaddressed issue~ as people speak of a soft catch as if it is an unvarying intervention unrelated to the host of conditions surrounding the belay event,1
399,From this perspective~ a tendency has evolved to blame the belayer for everything untoward that happens to a falling leader~ as if the soft catch was some kind of magical shield against all possible injury~ hence any injury becoming prima facie evidence of belayer misconduct,1
400,The issue of spiking has to do with the effects of penduluming into the rock~ and is not necessarily the same as reducing the load to the anchors; this is another area where the soft-catch discussion is muddled~ as the only published test results I've seen have to do with anchor loads~ not pendulum impacts,1
401," The video linked above is one of the few sources of information about the results of pendulums~ and as I mentioned it looks as if~ in the more nearly vertical situation~ and especially with short falls~  that the climber might be  ""spiking"" before the jump can mitigate the pendulum effects",1
402,This doesn't mean the soft catch might not have some application to single-pitch trad climbing~ but it does mean that extrapolating from other experience is fraught,1
403,We'd all be better off if we could get away from the smug proclamations and admit we know a lot less than we think.,1
404,Is this a bad idea? Does a bear shit in the woods? yes,1
405,A soft catch is just super incredible easy to master,1
406,You hardly have to do anything~ just let your hips give in and move at the right time,1
407,You be failin' and spikin' your leader if you are terrifiend and brace like you're getting hit by a linebacker and resistin' that movement,1
408,Also~ people must at some point learn to climb~ learn when that ol' soft catch is appropriate or not~ and not hope all this technologizin' will solve their many problems,1
409,That being said~ it's 2020~ not 1989~ so never use a non-brake assist tube style device unless youse inSANE!!!,1
410,Not sure if you noticed the different sides and where they live,1
411,For example~ places like RRG it makes sense to do a soft catch,1
412,On granite walls (California) those people generally tend to be less friendly with the soft catches,1
413,Hard/Soft Catch is like debating politics,1
414,Covid is a Hoax ;-),1
415,Seems this is solved pretty easily by just seeking out a rope with lower impact rating rather than the voodoo of jumping at whatever you /think/ is the right time to jump,1
416,As Rgold mentioned~ without actual~ personal~ measured data on the forces involved~ and a lot of practice~ you never really /know/ it you’re actually doing anything productive~ or making things worse.,1
417,I would prefer a person who reads the conditions of the fall and adjusts based on knowing/experience than an overly complicated device~ some of which require more experience to employ well.,1
418,Watch the climber~ pro~ and terrain and do what you think is in the climber's best interests,1
419,The device can't do that for you,1
420,#OkGumby,1
421,#OkGumby #OkGumby,1
422,Sheesh~ people...,1
423,There are a few Grigri type devices that do allow a bit of slippage~ the mad rock lifeguard being one,2
424,Mad rock also offers the Safeguard~ with no slippage~ for rescue and gym applications,2
425,"Problem is~ that ""lock even when the belayer drops dead"" thing is why people buy grigris or the like~ the ""hands off"" ""foolproof"" device~ and then stuff that Grigri into the hands of a totally inexperienced belayer...and wonder why things didn't go so swell",0
426,An on/off switch is an interesting idea...but then you're right back to the competence of the user,1
427,Overriding the cam is already a huge operator error,0
428,That slippage is probably best left to experience~ or~ pick how you belay carefully~ if you plan to blow out anchors regularly,1
429,I'm too lazy to hunt it up~ but Jim Titt has a spiffy chart showing how different devices lock~ or not~ the forces involved  And yes~ grigris are hard stop~ ATC and others less so,1
430,But it's a curve~ so more interesting than just hard and fast numbers,1
431,My guess is~ all the other factors will add up more than the belay device~ such as rope out~ drag~ climber/belayer weight~ terrain~ etc,1
432,I expect the other styles of assisted braking devices vary too~ there's a lot more on the market these days than ATC and Grigri,1
433,I've seen claims for the Alpine Up to auto lock~ unassisted~ but of course even Grigri instructions say use your brake hand,1
434,IIRC~ Munter and ATC are the gentlest~ but an experienced belayer that cares is still best~ IMO,1
435,By the way~ can too go past a vertical line on a less than vertical route~ way~ way past,1
436,Don't forget about climbing to one side or the other of that plumb line and setting yourself up for a nasty pendulum into whatever awaits beside you,1
437,Or~ ahead or behind~ on a traverse,1
438,Horizontal travel can nail you too,1
439,Best~ Helen,1
440,Having been dropped twice (outdoors trad~ with injuries)~ I’ll settle for just the catch...anything else is icing on the cake,1
441,Count me among the insane,1
442,Catching refrigerators with muscles too~ not skinny little pipsqueeks.,1
443,This is the “Leeroy Jenkins!!” post of the thread.,1
444,Your responses have been pretty absurd so far~ but now I am dying to see you demonstrate this master falling technique Gravity ONLY pulls down~ bud,1
445,So if it's not YOU pushing outward~ away from the vertical wall~ what is the force doing it? Or are you saying you DO push off~ deliberately~ to avoid grinding on the wall?,1
446,The climber fell out slightly from the wall then the rope came tight and she accelerated into the wall and twisted her ankle,1
447,I'm genuinely curious,1
448,Do you mean your climber bounced away from the wall and then you pulled her back in? If she was .5m,1
449,"or 1.5 feet~ roughly~ above a bolt~ I'm not sure a traditional ""soft catch"" would have made much difference",1
450,Those falls just above a bolt are often jarring,1
451,You're probably right about that,1
452,"It's worth noting that this is a thread that started with someone asking about creating a device to ""soft catch"" on Factor 2 falls",1
453,Which~ by definition~ only really happen in multipitch scenarios,1
454,Given that a belayer MUST be anchored for there to even be a fall factor 2 happening the whole debate about REAL soft catches (which~ again~ are a great trick in overhanging~ run-out situations to keep your climber from hitting the wall when they swing back) was sort of a non-sequitor,1
455,It's pretty hard to jump toward your falling climber when on a hanging belay at a multipitch anchor,1
456,The most bizarre soft catch dogma I've seen~ though~ was by certain testers at my gym when giving lead belay tests,1
457,"A person I know was failed on her lead belay test not because she failed to stop her climber or did anything wrong but because she didn't ""jump"" and give her climber a ""soft-catch"" on a juggy 5.10a climb that was dead vertical with lots of stuff sticking out of it",1
458,In other words~ not actually a place where a soft-catch is ideal,1
459,But this poor person is now likely to go through her entire climbing career thinking that you must ALWAYS jump when catching a fall or you're doing something wrong,1
460,I'm genuinely curious,1
461," Her fall pretty much described something between a semicircle and a ""J""~ where she popped off~ fell backwards then down",1
462,She yelled and I braced for the fall,1
463,As soon as her weight came onto the rope she accelerated and swung hard into the rock just a couple of feet below the bolt,1
464,I didn't move,1
465,I honestly don't recall what device I was using to belay.,1
466,I honestly don't recall what device I was using to belay,1
467,Well~ you caught her and she was okay~ so good work in the end,1
468,Thanks for answering,1
469,But that's the point that soft-catch advocates are trying to make: they don't have to be jarring~ because you can give a soft catch! Falls just above a bolt or gear are one of the places I'm more intentional about it for exactly that reason~ and such falls can be common if on well-protected routes at one's limit,1
470,I'm thinking of vertical or near-vertical walls here,1
471,It should go without saying~ but probably won't on this thread~ so to disclaim: no~ I won't do this if there's a ledge~ protrusion~ or the ground that the climber could hit,1
472,Is it always perfect? No~ but it usually works well and is better than the alternative~ particularly if the alternative is locking down hard.,1
473,Is it always perfect? No~ but it usually works well and is better than the alternative~ particularly if the alternative is locking down hard,1
474,"You are talking about comfort but the initial criticism that started this debate ""OMG never let that person belay you!"" was talking about safety.",1
475,I too aspire to be technically correct~ while completely missing the point and alienating everyone around me.,1
476,Don't be so hard on Artem.,1
477,So now we’ve gone from “a mysterious outward force nobody can explain” to “When falling we do often tilt backwards and we often kick off a bit...Pushing out is very common~ almost everybody does it~ despite those who spray otherwise”,1
478,i guess somebody explained it.,1
479,With all these hypothetical situations~ people are getting caught up on equipment as a substitute/crutch for skills,1
480,That goes for both the leader and belayer,1
481,Does anybody plan before they leave the ground??? If climbing at your limit~ you have an inkling of where the crux is and you’re within sight of your belayer~ do you talk about distance to the last piece of pro? how you might fall~ length of the fall~ risk of hitting a feature~ ground fall~ pendulums~ the amount of slack in the system and the type of catch~ etc??? All this jibber jabber makes me think not,1
482,If people expect a piece of equipment to make a fall “better” or “softer” or “safer”~ they’re fooling themselves and their partner,1
483,Sometimes a fall is a surprise..,1
484,that’s just climbing.,1
485," You are talking about comfort but the initial criticism that started this debate ""OMG never let that person belay you!"" was talking about safety",1
486,We must just have different ideas of what a soft catch is,1
487,That video is focused on what the climber should do~ rather than the belayer~ but most of the catches looked reasonably soft to me~ particularly given the nearness of the ground--on most of them the belayer went with the force of the fall and was pulled up in the air,1
488,(There's also a reference at one point to communicating with your belayer if possible so you can receive a softer catch.),1
489," It's already been said~ but this has become one of those ""team"" debates where people are more interested in their ""side"" winning than having a discussion where any of us could learn something",1
490,If someone wants to offer a clear explanation of the dynamics of a fall that justifies the use of a soft catch on a nonvertical slab~ I'm more than willing to be convinced.,1
491,Man it just gets better! Now you’ve moved from a vertical wall to a slab! Keep digging.,1
492,Nope: Vertical is at best a maybe~ slab is is a never.,1
493,Shit~ now it’s gonna be a quarry.,1
494,Nobody is arguing with that~ Charles,1
495,The belayer COULD have given his climber a softer catch if he had the timing and room to do so,1
496,That is true,1
497,"But he didn't and she wasn't ""spiked"" or injured or anything",1
498,"The actual proper ""soft catch"" technique isn't about comfort or because climbers are particularly fragile people",1
499,It's a deliberate technique to keep a climber on overhanging terrain from penduluming back into the rock~ often headfirst~ and not getting injured as a result,1
500,I’ve got 100’s-1000’s of falls taken and caught over 30ish years of climbing,1
501,And being pretty light~ often with a heavier belayer~ the difference in whether the belayer moves or not is incredibly obvious~ even on vertical walls.,1
502,This thread is great,1
503,It highlights the Dunning–Kruger effect very well,1
504,There are even people stating that they don't believe their lack of experience should factor in because the physics are simple to understand,1
505,As a climber that climbs 3 to 4 days a week on average for well over a decade~ I have a bit of experience,1
506,As an aerospace engineer~ I have a decent background in physics,1
507,I can tell you a good belay is complicated and requires skills and attentiveness,1
508," As my advanced dynamics teacher said~ ""Higher education is just a series of decreasing lies~ the higher you go the less we lie to you and the harder the math gets.""   The life long physics teacher was the only one in these 6 pages to say maybe he doesn't know everything",1
509,The arrogance of the inexperienced is always amazing,1
510,Man it just gets better! Now you’ve moved from unsafe to obvious! Keep digging,1
511,Yeah~ experience,1
512,I know people that are convinced that vaccines cause autism because of their very personal experience of raising a child with autism,1
513,I mean~ they've walked the walk..,1
514,You've got experience and credentials,1
515,Then can you give us a quick write up explaining the correct and appropriate situations for a soft catch? I'm particularly interested in why it would ever be necessary on slab~ since no one wants to go there.,1
516,Find one post of mine where I said not giving a soft catch was inherently unsafe,1
517,Of course it’s situational~ nobody is arguing that,1
518,When conditions don’t warrant softening the catch...duh~ don’t do it,1
519,But when they do~ yes it decreases the chance injury,1
520,And by “obvious” I mean specifically more likely to sprain/break an ankle.,1
521,And by “obvious” I mean specifically more likely to sprain/break an ankle,1

523,Then can you give us a quick write up explaining the correct and appropriate situations for a soft catch? I'm particularly interested in why it would ever be necessary on slab~ since no one wants to go there,1
524,It is apparent that you are missing the point of my post,1
525,You want this to be a simple thing someone can teach you in a 1000 or less character post,1
526,Only the truly inexperienced with a rudimentary understanding of physics think in this way,1
527,This is why you have the two camps talking past each other,1
528,I'm not talking about the fall Philip described specifically~ I'm taking issue with your suggestion that falls just above a bolt are often jarring,1
529,I don't think they need to be and in my experience usually aren't,1
530,I don't agree that there isn't sufficient timing and room to give a soft catch in such situations~ or that soft catches are limited to overhanging terrain,1
531,However~ as I said to Dave~ it may be that we have different ideas of what a soft catch is,1
532,Perhaps we agree more than we realize,1
533,That being said~ I just don't think these short falls usually need to be jarring at all~ which makes me wonder,1
534,We have crossed into that argument zone where it is now about who is saying the same thing better...,1
535,The topic was FF2 falls,1
536,Help me understand the soft catch process for FF2~ please? Slab~ vert or overhanging~ I don't care,1
537,Explain for me how to soft catch an FF2 with~ for example~ a grigri,1
538,Thank you!,1
539,Jesus~ you’re dense~ “inherently” would be ignoring all other factors~ like ledges and obstacles,1
540,You know very well nobody is advocating softening the catch even if it would add to the risk of hitting an obstacle,1
541,If those factors/obstacles don’t exist then~ yes~ I’m saying unequivocally~ softening the catch will result in fewer injuries on vertical to overhanging terrain,1
542,I’m making no statement as to whether this holds true for slabs.,1
543,I can clearly see the belayer giving the climber a soft catch~ in the same frame.,1
544,ZZZZzzz Clearly y'all need a hobby,1
545,That video looks like contrived bullshit and incompetent belaying to me,1
546,If you fall that far below your gear for only having it at your knee when the fall started - you WILL eventually hit something on the way down - and with a lot of force,1
547,It's just a matter of time,1
548," It's not rocket science to see this guy in particular would have fully cratered into the ground if he was a body length or more above that draw - hardly even a ""long"" run-out",1
549," This video nicely shows what NOT to do for a ""soft catch"".",1
550,Leron: do you know what a fall factor 2 fall is?,1
551,I think we agree more than you realize,1
552,"Yeah~ with 30 feet of rope and direct line of sight the belay COULD HAVE stepped forward or ""hopped"" or whatever to make it more comfortable",1
553,Or they could also not have,1
554,And~ in the end~ the climber was fine which is what matters most,1
555,"When I said~ ""often"" it's because it depends a lot on the angle of the climb (not jarring at all when you fall 1.5 feet past the bolt on a dead overhang) and~ most of all~ the amount of rope in the system",1
556,The primary source of give in the modern climbing system would be our dynamic ropes with their 30% impact stretch,1
557," My issue with the ""all catches should be soft catches"" line is that there's not even consensus about what is a soft catch",1
558,"Is it leaping into the catch? Is it leaning or stepping forward slightly forward and ""giving"" when it hits? Is it feeding slack or letting your brake hand slip on an ATC? I've heard all of those thrown about as the ""true"" soft catch",1
559,I appreciate a great dynamic belay,1
560,I've had a good soft catch save me from slamming into overhanging rock numerous times while sport climbing,1
561,Hooray for that,1
562,But if I'm 90 feet above you on a ledgy or juggy multipitch trad climb just CATCH me,1
563,I don't want anyone increasing the distance of my fall in that case by leaping or anything else,1
564,"My issue with the ""all catches should be soft catches"" line is that there's not even consensus about what is a soft catch",1
565,I think we're mostly talking past each other at this point,1
566,"Who on this thread is saying ""all catches should be soft catches"" or suggesting leaping on a juggy/ledgy multipitch? I'm certainly not~ and there's a wide spectrum between that and overhanging sport climbs",1
567,"Though I do agree with your implication that it would be helpful to define our terms--""soft catch""--before we debate these issues",1
568,I'm curious exactly what you do on a short fall on a clean vertical wall but I'm not sure I have the energy to keep discussing this!,1
569,"Who on this thread is saying ""all catches should be soft catches"" or suggesting leaping on a juggy/ledgy multipitch? Not you",1
570,Artem was essentially saying all catches should be soft catches,1
571,"He even has the ninja reflexes to ""soft catch"" someone past a ledge~ apparently",1
572,I want video of that because if it's true it's RAD.,1
573,Not you,1
574,Since I am bored - yes I agree that all catches should be soft,1
575,Of course~ if you hit a ledge or something else the catch stops being soft,1
576,Hence~  a soft catch is meant to prevent you hitting things/ledges/ground hard,1
577,See - definition of soft catch is not that hard.,1
578,Who cares about all this fall catching stuff,1
579,The most important quality of a belayer is whether they shame you appropriately for grabbing the rope at your tie in point when you fall,1
580,Lol I unfollowed this thread but keep seeing it pop back up on the recent threads table,1
581,Only MP can we go 7 pages arguing about something as simple as this,1
582,Any bets on how long we'll be beating this dead horse all while insulting each other virtually (as is the custom on the board)? I say this is headed straight for a page 10~ or maybe even 15.,1
583,I'll throw something else in here..,1
584,I'm the lighter partner~ and granted~ I don't lead much~ but I do fall lots and lots when I do~ lol,1
585,We pretty much always climb on my rope~ and my partners are usually heavier,1
586,Sometimes much heavier,1
587,"And yet~ no one has ever attempted a ""soft catch""~ and no catch I have had has ever been anything I'd object to",1
588,So why is that? Just beginners luck? Or~ would my rather stretchy newish rope make a difference? I know it adds a lot to the falls my big guys take if they peel (I keep that in mind~ especially close to the start)~ and they lose a fair amount of ground if they hang to ponder a move very long,1
589,So~ rope a factor in soft versus hard? I'm not talking static~ obviously~ just whatever rope you usually climb on,1
590,Just curious,1
591,By page 7 anything's fair game~ eh? Best~ Helen,1
592,I'm curious exactly what you do on a short fall on a clean vertical wall but I'm not sure I have the energy to keep discussing this! Well~ obviously bicarbonate of soda makes bread rise.,1
593,I don't know what Artem is climbing~ but MOST of the time I can't even see/hear the leader where I climb..,1
594,I climb mostly in the mountains(on trips)~ routes don't go straight up,1
595,My rope is springy enough thank you~ and there is always some slack in the system~ don't be giving me any more to allow me to hit a ledge,1
596,I usually outweigh my partners~ and am more concerned about bashing them into unconsciousness in a fall rather than getting the softest possible catch,1
597,Single pitch sport climbing is a different story~ soft catch away...I weigh > 200 lbs so I'll be pulling you right off your feet anyway,1
598,Helen~,1
599," A climbing partner of mine who is an actual rocket scientist (and who also gives great sport soft catches) once explained to me that if the weight difference between two parties is too much the concept of a ""soft catch"" doesn't really pencil out because whenever your weight (say 100 lbs) hits the end of the rope against 200 lbs the 100 lb delta on that causes you to just stop~ no matter what",1
600,And if the larger person happens to hop early and is coming back DOWN~ well~ then the jolt is even worse,1
601,So good thing we solved that problem with ropes that stretch 30%,1
602,One of my primary climbing partners weighs about 60 lbs less than me,1
603,She always gives me a soft catch~ even if she sits down when I'm falling,1
604,Safe but also no mercy.,1
605,Now I am going to say~ OP making a gri gri like you mentioned with a soft catch feature would be extremely difficult because the GriGri cams on the rope to stop it and there has to be so much force involved and then it is either an all or nothing cam,1
606,Soft catches are best given by the belayer themselves after they have read the situation and have the experience to know how soft to make the fall (it could be a hard catch or it could be a super soft catch depending on what best fits in the situation),1
607,And finally guys~ soft catches are something that we can all agree that no one can agree on,1
608,I have had soft catches on slabby climbs that have been quite nice~ and I have had soft catches on over hangs that have kinda sucked and I wished my belayed would have made it a hard catch,1
609,The moral of this story is which is better soft catch or hard catch is based purely on preference,1
610,They both have situations that can be dangerous and both have times when one would be better over the other~ but lots of the time either one works and as long as you are caught it doesn't really matter how it happened just that you didn't deck and that you didn't get decapitated on an overhanging ledge,1
611,Last thing~ throwing personal insults at other people's comments doesn't improve your own point,1
612,I personally am a fan of soft catches because I have hurt my back getting a hard catch before in the past~ but I can see the merit behind getting a hard catch in certain situations,1
613,So if I buy another rope I might want to consider this? Stick with a similar amount of elongation? At the very least~ I'd know what to expect,1
614,I've had the years long benefit of that physics guy on here patiently explaining stuff to the noob with endless questions...,1
615,I've had the years long benefit of that physics guy on here patiently explaining stuff to the noob with endless questions..,1
616,I recently switched over to Edelweiss ropes and love mine,1
617,It's 60M and has a bi-pattern to it,1
618,It has a great stretch amount for soft falls~ If you are looking for a new rope I would definitely recommend,1
619,I've broken several sets of trigger wires over the years - it seems the only BD-supported way to repair them is to send them in for service,1
620,The UL trigger wires seems flimsier,1
621,Has anyone come up with a way to replace these wires with something a bit more substantial?   I do recognize that these cams are as light as they are because they trimmed all the grams~ and the irony of thinking about doing anything to them that would increase weight,1
622,But the wires do seem to be a weak point~ and maybe worth adding a tiny bit more mass,1
623,yes~ i have fixed a dozen or so,1
624,i use a hand crimper tool from amazon,1
625,i stick with the same size wire rope to keep them light since the repair is easy.,1
626,I've replaced trigger wires on normal c4s with weed wacker line,1
627," 0.065"" worked for me~ but I'm not sure if it'll fit for the ultralights",1
628,Hey~ I was wondering what do you guys usually carry on your harness besides normal protection like quick draws or trad protection? My current rack for relatively short less than a day single and multi pitch climbing from left to right is: - 120cm sling for attaching light belayer,1
629,- 60cm sling for making a lanyard if needed,1
630,- Another 60cm sling for random use,1
631,Both have a small screw gate,1
632,-Two medium size HMS screw gates for anchoring etc,1
633,- Grigri,1
634,Good for climbing with single rope,1
635,Not that useful for double ropes or two followers,1
636,- 240cm sling for trad anchors,1
637,-Water bottle for long trad routes with a small screwgate,1
638,-ATC and two HMS screwgates for belay,1
639,-Ropeknife with a small screwgate,1
640,-Two prusik's with one small screwgate each,1
641,- Microtraction with a light HMS screwgate,1
642,-Two 120cm slings for self rescue and extending pieces etc.,1
643,Seems like a lot of redundancy,1
644,Youll know after a while what you use and dont use,1
645,Leave the stuff you dont use,1
646,Regardless of how much you bring~ itll just be weight training.,1
647,That’s for sure more than I carry,1
648,The only item that is 100% of the time consistently on my harness regardless of what kind of multipitch I’m doing is a wiregate with a very small amount of athletic tape around the spine~ (for ‘locking’ non-locking carabiners) a Hollowblock~ a tiny knife~ and a microtrax,1
649,Everything else depends on the larger context of the route~ but is usually some variation of this: 120cm dyneema sling on a single locker for general use Single belay device,1
650,(Usually a camp ovo with two lockers or a grigri with one) Single locker for cloving in or a dedicated tether with locker if rope-solo-seconding,1
651,1 anchor setup per person (usually a 240cm dyneema sling or a cordalette) Sometimes I have an extra wiregate for the microtrax if I’m hauling pitches on a free climb  Everything else (Prussiks~ extra slings~ lockers~ etc,1
652,is redundant or better carried in a small pack,1
653,(Water),1
654,Wow,1
655,I think I counted 14 lockers in that photo you posted,1
656," If this is your rack for ""relatively short days~"" i.e",1
657,less than a full day~ it seems like way too much to me,1
658,I'd carry 3 lockers~ maybe 4~ haha,1
659,Don't forget yer nut tool,1
660,Sport climbing the only thing I take is a Grigri.,1
661,All of your stuff could get used on some route or other,1
662,On one hand what you choose to carry is your affair~ even if its more than you strictly need,1
663,So whatever you want~ to a large extent.On the other load yourself too much and you might not be able to squeeze through that chimney and you may get to the end of every pitch of the route with most of that shit still hanging there on your harness~ unused,1
664,If you didn't use it you didn't need it,1
665,Try eliminating any piece of gear you didn't use on your last outing~ if you want,1
666,I prefer to strip optional gear out of the equation.,1
667,Why not rappel on your gri gri and pass on both of the prusik's :)? I used to bring pruskiks too~ but then i started using my 60cm slings as a prusiks,1
668,They're not as smooth~ but since i don't prusik regularly I don't mind,1
669,I also bring 2x 120cm slings but i have mine on Camp nano 22 wire gate carabiners and can't say that i've ever wished they were lockers.,1
670,If using a plate style device~ there's definitely no need for more than three lockers (one for atc/one for guide mode masterpoint/one for your tether/clove),1
671,If you're climbing runout routes where a single protection point failure (i.e,1
672,freak accident of biner becomes unclipped) you can always double up opposite opposed nonlockers.,1
673,Yeah uh oh there's 16 lockers in the pic,1
674,Yikes :D Yeah I know it's overkill,1
675,That's why I asked,1
676,I do take beginners to climb quite often and they regularly forget their stuff on the ground,1
677,That's the reason for the extra HMS biner and extra prusik~ but yeah I do carry way too many small srewgates,1
678,-Nut tool goes in the nut rack or I give it to the second,1
679,-I usually choose to carry either Grigri or ATC,1
680,They both really good in their own way,1
681,-I have one wiregate dedicated for shoes and chalk,1
682,Maybe I should put that another prusik and knife and the water bottle there.,1
683,Instead of prussiks and extra slings~ I include two nylon slings as a part of 2 of my alpine draws,1
684,These work as prussiks and won't melt if you use them as a third hand,1
685,I think a lot of your extra slings are redundant if you consider that every alpine draw can be broken down into a sling for whatever off-nominal issue comes up,1
686,Definitely a lot of lockers on your rack,1
687,I've had much fewer when carrying everything with two newbie climbers,1
688,By my count~ all you need is: 1) Lower anchor master point locker 2) Personal clove hitch locker 3&4) ATC lockers 5) Upper anchor master point locker (since you'll need enough to build 2 anchors at a time for multi pitch) And then I bring 2x 240 cm slings to make both anchors.,1
689," ""Wiregate with a very small amount of athletic tape around the spine."" Why not carry one small screwgate instead? What carabiner do you use with the microtrax? A dedicated one or just some random one? ""Hollowblock~ a tiny knife and camp ovo"" These would be nice",1
690,"""Sometimes I have an extra wiregate for the microtrax if I’m hauling pitches on a free climb"" Is this for redundancy?",1
691,Interesting thread --- I like the idea of reducing lockers but bringing tape to backup lockers,1
692,For me at least~ I think of the slings + wiregates as belonging with the protection/leader,1
693,Seems like you can lose the dedicates prussiks in favor of slings in a rescue scenario.,1
694,Okay so I shaved about 325 grams,1
695,I do plan for rescue if someone needs one,1
696,Not necessary for the ultimate lightest setup~ but too much is too much..,1
697,This is the extra I shaved off,1
698,Yeah It's true that I can just break down alpine draws if I need 60 slings.,1
699,It really depends on the area and type of climbing doing,1
700,Sport:  if there's permadraws already hung~ its probably overhanging,1
701,So ill normally carry one or two draws and a hollow block cord,1
702,This allows me to boink up the rope easier~ by using a draw as handle,1
703,If it's more vertical I'll carry a belay device~ Hollow block~ anchor setup~ bail biner~ nut tool (has a built in wrench) For sport multipitch I add to the above gear a micro trax and a small pully,1
704,Trad multipitch: Belay device~ anchor setup~ 5-6 extra wiregate biners~ 2- D shape lockers~ 2 pear shaped lockers~  nut tool~ hollow block~ left hand ascender~ pully~ u ascend~  5 meters-7mm anchor cord,1
705,(At least I think it's 5m...)  Hell there's probably something else I'm forgetting!,1
706,As others have said~ it seems like an awful lot of stuff..,1
707,My extras generally are: A PAS with a locker~ but that is because I've used one for a while and am just used to it,1
708,It I were starting over I would use a simpler personal tether (1 locker),1
709,Either a pre-tied quad (if there are bolted anchors) or a long cordalette (trad) either of them with 4 lockers (5 total),1
710,My Alpine Smart with a spare locker for guide mode belaying (there are 2 more lockers~ so 7 total)),1
711,An ATC on a locker for multipitch just in case (funny~ I have never dropped my main device but I have dropped my back-up ATC~ so now 8 lockers),1
712,A nut tool~ but only for trad routes (comes with a tether and clip),1
713,A water bottle for multipitch or if I am belaying from the top on a hot day (non-locker).,1
714,Why so much? Are you hauling?,1
715,Give as much weight as possible to the follower~ they are on top rope,1
716,You are leading,1
717,I bring:,1
718,Okay so now this should be good enough,1
719,Seven Lockers one wiregate,1
720,Optional Grigri prusik and 120 sling.,1
721,What is the micro trax for? Have you ever needed to use it? I mean I don't take beginners out often but I carry way~ way less than is shown in even your updated image here,1
722,Do you regularly use all of these things?,1
723,Why even five? I have one for my ATC/grigri~ one for anchoring myself~ and one or two for misc,1
724,use,1
725,I have to double up non lockers sometimes~ but not terribly often,1
726,That being said~ there is a point where the convenience of having a little more stuff is worth some more weight.,1
727,A rescue can be improvised~ only bring a microtrax if you plan on hauling your partner up,1
728,Skip the tethers if you're with a competent partner~ if you're bringing up an non leading second on a multipitch they can carry their own tether~ if they can't remember that they can't really be trusted to belay,1
729,And to answer the question 1 Dmm boa masterpoint 1 attache for atc + 1 superlight locker 1 dmm sentinal for my grigri I will have water on a locking biner but it's extremely rare that I'd be hanging it off my harness (250m routes in the scorching heat)  If sport climbing i will literally have 1 draw on me after I've put up the draws.,1
730,Lets see: -one 240cm sling w/locker & one cordalette w/locker for belays -one belay device (usually tube) w/locker or grigri -one hollow block and gloves on mini biner,1
731,-pas or sling -couple extra light weight biners for bolted anchors -water bottle for long routes -LaSpo TX2 for descent if walk off -nut tool for follower~ so sometimes I carry it,1
732,I can think of a few situations where 4 is what I'd want,1
733,One extra for piece of mind,1
734,Agreed,1
735,I will say that I almost run out of things often~ and have to improvise maybe 5%-10% of the time,1
736,IMO~ that's the point: to go as light and simply as possible without being a pain in my ass,1
737,If I am consistently using all of the things on my harness on most pitches while still able to deal with any emergencies that arise~  I feel like my system is appropriate,1
738,Holy crap ya'll bring a lot of gear,1
739,What are the grigris for? I can see if you are projecting at your limit~ but you'll want an ATC-like device anyway,1
740,A guide mode tube works for self-rescue applications and is way more versatile,1
741,Full day trad: DMM Pivot + locker for belay 120cm or 240cm sling on a small locking biner (Spirit) Hollow block 2-3 small wire-gate biners Nut tool Maybe a small knife with a little tape (rarely~ unless tat is expected~ etc) Chalk bag (sling is an emergency prussik) Phone if reception or for topo (1 per group) as needed Of course water~ and a small bar~ if needed...,1
742,Ok I'll play,1
743,Only 3 things live permanently on my harness.,1
744,Well honestly I haven't needed the Microtrax for a real rescue situation,1
745,It's purpose is for rescuing unconscious leader(or a follower) where I have to fix the rope to the belay anchor and ascend up the rope to the leader and haul him to a new anchor I've just made,1
746,Also handy for hauling the follower over the crux,1
747,I do use them all quite regularly,1
748,You need one HMS per second to tie them in with a clove hitch,1
749,So If you have for example three seconds then you need three extra HMS screwgates,1
750,It's however newer happened that all three followers forgot their tie in biners on the ground,1
751,Small srewgates,1
752,Yeah I'have newer used them all at once but they are quite handy for making bomber anchors and threads and a attaching lanyards etc,1
753,I guess they could be replaced with wiregates.,1
754,For sport climbing multipitches I carry: The right amount of quickdraw Reverso + 2 screwgates PAS + screwgate Prussik 2 x 1.20 meters slings each with 2 regular biners Quicklink and a couple of random biners  Climbing knife I don't do much pure trad climbing but for alpine climbing I add: No PAS (I use the rope) No knife (Leatherman Crunch in the backpack) A few nuts Full set of cams (or less depending on the route) Switch the quickdraws for alpine quickdraws A bunch of slings + biners 1 cordelette Microtraxion + oval biner Ice screws if needed Crevasse rescue kit if needed,1
755,Typical Yosemite route between 500-1500 ft for me 5 Miniwire Quickdraws 4-5 skinny Dyneema Alpine Draws 1 120cm Dyneema (only if rapping or I need it for a particular placement) 2 lightweight lockers 1 grigri 2 1 atc 1 nut tool with prussik on a non-locker 2 quads made from 240cm dyneema with miniwires (if not in a hurry) 1 Edelrid Spoc (for self rescue~ photo jugging~ or impromptu simuling) Spare wiregate for shoes spare wiregate for bike bottle,1
756,Bong? I don't see a bong.,1
757,Thats alot of stuff,1
758,For a standard multipitch trad route I carry: - a GriGri on a locker OR an atc guide device plus two lockers -prusik on a wiregate -knife and tibloc on a locker -if its off the beaten path~ I will bring a cordalette on a wiregate I have no need for all of the extra slings,1
759,Half of my alpine draws use nylon runners~ so I can use them for prusiks or cut them and sling small trees,1
760,As for the lockers~ you only need a couple (for your belay devices and emergency ascender),1
761,I use non lockers for pretty much everything else.,1
762,What actually goes with me on every climb lives in and on this sweet Tufa chalk bag:,1
763,yeah~ that's definitely a lot of stuff,1
764,i typically have a belay device and biner (either grigri or light ATC type)~ a nut tool that has a wiregate~ a prussik clipped in the nut tool's wire gate~ and two or maybe 3 light lockers for anchors,1
765,sometimes i will substitute my trango shark knife/nut tool for my usual nut tool,1
766,"i also have a 9 foot doubled piece of 1/2"" webbing for my chalkbag~ and another one for the belt of my pants",1
767,i definitely cringe at your water bottle setup,1
768,i have almost been taken out from above by 2 water bottles like that which came loose,1
769,it would be better to take about a foot of webbing and then a handfull of wraps of duct tape around the bottle.,1
770,This is nuts dude,1
771,Sport climbing i have A chalk bag and 1 draw,1
772,The belayer has a grigri a glove and belay goggles,1
773,Trad 3 120s on a single biner each~ for extension threads anchors...many uses,1
774,In the pocket of my chalkbag a tiny knife~ a tiny elight a single rolled rap ring and a tiblock (which is my sole nicety in my mind)  a reverso/ belay plate and 3 lockers one locker has a 6mm aramid rap cord,1
775,We belay with a grigri (Edit) if we are hauling a bag or leading a clean wall with no wind,1
776,We will bring a mirco and a 6mm or so aramide 65mm tag line to haul a small bag~ for shoes food water clothes ect,1
777,Somtimes  we will fix  the line and follow the pitch on a mirco while the leader hauls,1
778,In the scenario we each have a little more gear,1
779,Your rack has x number of alpines/draws Plus wires and cams ect plenty to draw from if you need to make more complex systems,1
780,You do not need more than 3 lockers What does plan for rescue mean? Its called improvised rescue,1
781,You dont need a SAR level redundancy.,1
782,Why so much? Are you hauling? Reading through the rest of this thread has made me realize I carry to much shit,1
783,However the non lockers are used to rack everything else~ and one pear shaped locker goes with the belay device,1
784,Leaving 1 pear for the master point and a D shaped locker to tie into,1
785,I have done few courses that included rescuing scenarios in various levels,1
786,Those all have a list's of equipment one need to have,1
787,So you plan and practice that rescue scenario beforehand,1
788,For example could be a scenario where you are rescuing an unconscious leader,1
789,I don't know about the term improvised rescue,1
790,Is it an American thing?,1
791,It's more of an experience thing - it's not specific to a nationality,1
792,In those courses you took pretty much every piece of gear can be substituted using other gear~ or a slightly different technique,1
793,Rescues can be done safely and effectively with pretty much nothing more than what you need to lead a typical pitch of trad~ and a few lockers.,1
794,Is it an American thing? The likelihood of needing any of that is near 0%,1
795,I have done it and its not so bad,1
796,But if you have aramide cord or a really long hollow block you can rappel a weighted line with the valdeton tresse,1
797,Its an arborism technique but applies wholesale to climbing,1
798,My normal personal gear for a few to many pitches of trad is: 3 lockers (one to clove hitch myself to the anchor~ two for guide mode on my belay device) 2 non-locking biners 2 double length slings (anchors) Petzl reverso Bail biner which holds: Nut tool~ pirahna knife~ and a 5mm prusik cord Chalk bag Optional: food~ water~ phone~ extra layers (down jacket~ rain shell)~ roll of climbing tape (dual purpose for medical use and repairs)~ approach shoes Optional x2: extra webbing if I expect I might bail and/or have unmaintained rappels I will cannibalize protection (slings~ biners~ etc) as needed to make an anchor if my two slings aren't ideal~ and also leave slings/gear behind in the event of a bail/emergency.,1
799," Ditto the ""Holy crap!"" comments!!! Most anchors are tied together with the rope and tie ins are simple clove hitch to locking biner",1
800,All slings~ doubles etc are part of the total gear avalable for leading~ anchors etc,1
801,I don't carry any extra slings for dedicated personal use,1
802,Generally use the first one cleaned when following as shoulder sling to rack cleaned gear,1
803,This is faster at belays than de-racking from harness,1
804,When it comes time to multi pitch rappel~ slings are tasked as personal tether and rappel device extension Dedicated personal gear: -ATC or ATC guide with HMS autolock biner -hollowblock or prussik and small locker for third hand or rescue -2-3 light lockers -nut tool -chalk bag with small pair EMT scissors in side pocket -bail biner doubles for hanging descent shoes -sometimes a water bottle -snacks in pants pockets,1
805,Lockers are pretty much luxury items,1
806,I do always bring a munter biner for belaying / rappelling either with a hitch or atc,1
807,Everything else can be done with biners on the rack,1
808,I add more lockers for specific climbs where they will make things more efficient or lighter.,1
809,"Is it an American thing? ""Improvised rescue"" simply means to self-rescue without the assistance of an outside SAR group.",1
810,You put lockers on the bolt or gear ends of your anchors? I just use wiregates like with every other piece of gear I clip on a route,1
811,The only locker goes on the masterpoint,1
812,So my lockers would be: 1 small one for personal anchor,1
813,Belay device locker (I use a Mammut smart alpine)~ one more for masterpoint,1
814,If I run out I just use opposite and opposed wiregates,1
815,It really comes down to what you think needs a locker,1
816,I dont build anchors with lockers just 2 super light wire gates and if it's a 3 point then a cam has a racking carabiner,1
817,So for me it's just 3 lockers,1
818,Belay device locker guide mode locker clove hitch locker,1
819,If I bring a micro T it gets a locker,1
820,If I'm bringing shoes they go in a pack,1
821,If I'm rapping then no shoes,1
822,Nut tool and prussic go on 1 wire gate,1
823,Instead of a knife I taped a razor in a helmet (taped up and angled so I can't get cut) chalk bag on wire gate too,1
824,If I bring water its in a pack (Camelback is great to drink and belay)  or the follower carries it,1
825,I could lose a lot of weight with lightweight shoes,1
826,Gotta find some I like for cheap...,1
827,Multi-pitch Trad setup: - Grigri with auto locker as main belay device for both leader and (especially) follower- HMS screwgate to tether my climbing rope tie in to the anchor- Reverso and hollow block stored on old non-locking bail biner for rappels / emergencies - 2 more auto lockers to set up a fixed-point lead belay~ rap with Reverso~ use as master point with girth hitch/clove hitch/rap ring anchors~ etc,1
828,- double length sling on non-locker- triple length sling on non-locker - nut tool- water bottle on shock cord (Gatorade ftw!)So 4 lockers total~ including 1 on the grigri,1
829,3 are auto locking~ mostly because I've had a couple screwgates jam closed on me,1
830,Exception is the HMS I use to tether myself~ which is a screw gate so I can clip it one handed,1
831,For single pitch trad I'll leave behind the triple length sling and water,1
832,For sport climbing I'll also leave behind the nut tool and one of the spare auto lockers~ but keep the Reverso/hollow block~ and double length sling in case I find myself needing to rap,1
833,For my anchors I try and use minimal gear and minimal knots favouring girth/clove hitches instead~ especially if it's a hanging belay,1
834,If I can clip a big auto locker onto a beefy backed up ring anchor~ that's my first choice for a master point,1
835,For 2-bolt anchors I'll use the rope to clove the first with my HMS and clip a bowline on a bight to the second bolt as my master point (banshee belay),1
836,For 3 point Trad anchors I'll use the double length sling to equalize 2 pieces with a girth hitch~ clove hitch my tie in to that~ then clove hitch the third piece with the back side of my tie-in,1
837,This assumes we're swinging leads,1
838,If we're block leading I'm more likely to use the double or triple length sling in a more conventional quad anchor~ pre-equalized~ or banshee belay setup~ but I really try and avoid busting out the triple length sling whenever possible - it's just too much material.,1
839,Put your device back on a gear loop and never rack it again,1
840,I have:,1
841,Post coffee post..,1
842,..,1
843,my standard set up is two alpine runners with lockers; this stays on my right rear gear loop~ next to my belay device~ at all times unless it's actively being used--ask me why,1
844,On long routes I shoulder the slings~ gear loop the lockers~ and rack a cordellette.,1
845,Why?,1
846,So my lockers would be: 1 small one for personal anchor,1
847,That's exactly what I do.,1
848,That's exactly what I do,1
849,In addition to the time: the weight~ and the fact that they're different from the rest of the biners you're carrying so you end up with 'specialized' biners that can only go one place~ vs a biner that can be used for almost any purpose,1
850,I think carrying multipurpose gear is ideal.,1
851,This is a small detail,1
852,I put a couple wraps of tape around my folding knife to keep it from accidentally opening,1
853,Tape could then be used for locking a non-locker.,1
854,My current setup: -Cordalette + Locker (+1 more for other climber) -Locker for Clove-Hitching in -GriGri+ Locker -Nut tool (+1 more for other climber) -Knife -Hollow-block + locker -ATC + locker for rapping/backup Opportunities for weight savings: consolidating to just ATC for some climbs~ going from 5 -> 3 lockers.,1
855," ""I don't have a problem with lockers per se~ but I do have a problem with the time and effort that goes into constantly locking and unlocking them~ and double checking whether they are locked..."" +1 Every climb I have",1
856,1 twist lock HMS for belay biner with belay device~ 1 autolock for tether/master point biner runner length 6mm prussic and mini biner in chalk bag pocket---      teeny tiny multitool (about 1 1/2 inches long with scissors~ nail file and knife)      nuts and washers (for bolts with the hanger stolen to use with wired nut)      cut off toothbrush trad add---      nut tool      pink tri cam if using someone else's rack multi-pitch add---      aaa light in pants pocket      double runner in 6.5 mm dynamic cord on oval wiregate,1
857,I have seriously considered carrying a pink tricam in my chalk bag pocket.,1
858,you should know how to Munter~ then you could skip the belay plate if your main belay is the gri gri,1
859,Hell~ if it's bolted anchors you could skip all the belay devices and just use a munter,1
860,Always: Nut Tool + Wiregate ATC + HMS Locker Prussik + Locker Double length sling + Locker Optional: Additional double length sling + HMS Water  Snack Webbing  Knife Beer,1
861,I don't have a problem with lockers per se~ either~ but just don't see why they'd be at all useful on the gear of an anchor,1
862,We trust our lives to non-locking biners every time we are leading above any piece of gear or a quickdraw~ right? So what is special about an anchor that it'd require lockers on three different pieces for gear with a primarily downward angle of pull? Plus the gear already has racking biners,1
863,Just seems like a lot to carry and extra time and effort as you correctly note,1
864,The only place I really feel like a locker is required would be on my belay device and on a rappel device,1
865,You only need 3 lockers,1
866,2 for a guide mode atc and 1 for your clove hitch,1
867,If you want to extend and back up your rappels~ you have the 3 lockers needed (for sling tether~ ATC~ and autoblock),1
868,Optional locker on your shoes or water bottle if you’re doing a chimney or something,1
869,Voila Also if you’re carrying your shoes~ put stuff  in them! Why carry a knife on a locker when you could just put it in your empty shoe,1
870,Throw Some food in there too,1
871,Why? After leaving the ground without it I was forced to Munter down Kern Slab: not fun~ slightly disruptive~ and embarrassing!,1
872,After reading Touching the Void I no longer carry a knife; I do carry six lockers including my belay though...,1
873,For a multi pitch trad climb I carry : Grigri on a locker Atc on a locker Prusik on a locker double length sling on a locker or Lockerdraw  cordlette on non locker and / or Long thin dyneema sling on non locker One extra non locker Knife~ headlamp on a toy biner,1
874,If you carry a Grigri and a microtraxion there is no need for prusik loops,1
875,Each can be used as an ascender if needed,1
876,Unless your one of the safety concerned people who like backing up a grigri,1
877,I don't have a problem with lockers per se~ either~ but just don't see why they'd be at all useful on the gear of an anchor,1
878,The only place I really feel like a locker is required would be on my belay device and on a rappel device,1
879,I try not to trust my life to any single piece of gear when leading,1
880,If a piece fails I should be caught by the next piece,1
881,It may mean significant injury but not death.,1
882,That's why I also carry the knowledge of how to tie a knot,1
883,It adds some weight~ but I think it's worth it.,1
884,It may mean significant injury but not death,1
885,I'm with you on that~ but you're not trusting your life to a single piece of gear when using regular carabiners on the anchor pieces of a 3 piece anchor~ either,1
886,I typically use a locker as a master point biner but if I'm ever short one I'm also happy to use a couple opposite and opposed regular biners,1
887,I'm with you on that~ but you're not trusting your life to a single piece of gear when using regular carabiners on the anchor pieces of a 3 piece anchor~ either,1
888,On multi you get one at master-point: top rope two of any kind I have handy,1
889,Thanks for all the answers,1
890,Keep them coming,1
891,:) It's interesting how everyone seem to have a bit different setup like their own flavor and no one have it exactly the same,1
892,I now realise that my setup is so bulky because I regularly climb with two or three newbies who have no own eqipment or skils to use it,1
893,I guess this is not that normal practise,1
894,What comes to belay it's kind of like rope solo climbing because they either newer belayed before or have limited experice with it,1
895,I do climb easy enough not to fall and easy enough for people who have newer climbed trad or rock before,1
896,With a competend partners I take a lot less,1
897,With leaders better than my level I tend to be very consiuos with weight,1
898,I just take the belay/rappeling equipment and a nut tool,1
899,I'll be cleaning after them anyway,1
900,For the upcomimg weekend trip I'm going to take the mp's advice and try to climb with less,1
901,I understand less is sometimes more,1
902,More climbing meters with less weight,1
903,How is this looking?,1
904," If you know a climb has ""traditional anchors"" (talking bolts here) ie 2 bolts in vertical orientation with.a chain connecting them and a single rap ring you can carry a single locker as your entire anchor just clip it to the ring and bam master point",1
905,Then just clip your clove and belay device to that masterpoint locker and Bob's your uncle,1
906,For that kinda anchor ultralight gear would be 1 locker for master point 1 locker and belay device (only 1 device ie mega July or grigri on the anchor for me) 1 locker for guide mode and prussic with my nut tool So that's 4 lockers 1 belay device nut tool and prussic ona wire gate,1
907,No cord or slings.,1
908,When I was a brand new rookie fireman still wet behind the ears I soaked up all the advice I could get from the older fireman,1
909,The thing I quickly realized when it came to equipment and tools that were ”essential“ to carry in my fire coat and pants is that if I took everyone’s advice I would soon be carrying 50lbs of extra crap that various salty fireman deemed essential,1
910,While all were well meaning and all the tools and gear served a purpose I obviously didn’t need ALL of it and I paired my essentials down to what suited me and the areas I worked,1
911,The same goes for climbing~ take in all the advice but pair it down to YOUR essentials,1
912,I had to read this few times,1
913,I don't know about Bob D: but yeah this is the best method,1
914,I always feel like why would you build an anchor from sligs on top of the perfectly good and superduper solid anchor,1
915,For top roping ofcource but for stand there is no need to do that,1
916,It's quite usual that there's two rings and I've heard that top one is good for connecting devices and the bottom is meant for rope,1
917,Side note,1
918,For groups more than three the masterpoint locker is a very good idea,1
919,You run out of space if you try connect everyone to that top ring.,1
920,After reading Touching the Void I no longer carry a knife; I do carry six lockers including my belay though..,1
921,After reading Touching the Void I have learnt how to pass a knot..!,1
922,After reading Touching the Void I have learnt how to pass a knot..! o.O,1
923,That looks like a very reasonable kit at the moment~ and significantly pared down from what you first posted,1
924,Aside from the rack~ I take a double length sling for personal anchor/anchor material on a locker and an ATC on a locker,1
925,Also~ one extra locker for guide mode,1
926,I've used this set up for many years and never wished I had more gear on me,1
927,Some of this gear we use every time~ some of it we use as insurance,1
928,It's like a monthly budget~ we all have to buy groceries but do we need to buy the AAA roadside assistance? You don't need it until you need it,1
929,If we do need it you'll l be glad you have it~ but some never will need it.,1
930,Yes~ but I wonder if bringing a micro-trax and so many additional slings is equivalent to also carrying spare alternator belt~ two spare tires~ etc,1
931,- One HMS locker for anchoring myself,1
932,- grigri with locker for belaying / rappelling,1
933,- Chalk bag with 6mm cord as belt (doubles as friction hitch cord) Everything else can be accomplished using whats on the rack.,1
934,I like to reduce the amount of carabiners on my harness that don't get used,1
935,I'll put my rappel prusik in a pocket or stuffed in shoes instead of on the harness,1
936,Instead of using a carabiner for shoes I tie the laces through my haul loop,1
937,I use a $1 gas station cheapo knife with a 3mm keeper loop that's super light and have one wrap of tape to keep it shut,1
938,Nut tool is the kind with an integrated clip gate instead of requiring a dedicated carabiner,1
939,As others have posted~ a small amount of tape is useful for locking nonlockers when bailing,1
940,Some folks use cord to tie a chalk bag belt~ which ensures that you always have a little extra material if you need to bail,1
941," Felt it worth commenting on the ""we'll use the rack"" notion",1
942,(Not calling out Buster in particular on this one; his kit seems to have taken this into account.),1
943,But depending upon where you are driving that might not be a bad idea..,1
944,do we keep it in the truck all the time or take it in and out of the garage depending on the trip..,1
945,so many decisions in life!,1
946,But depending upon where you are driving that might not be a bad idea..,1
947,so many decisions in life! To every thing~ there is a season!,1
948,The longer I climb the lighter it gets,1
949,Often just a grigri on a locker~ a nut tool~ and a couple wire gates,1
950,Water bottle and a wind breaker if the climb is longer/might get windy and cold,1
951,Swing leads a build anchors with the rope~ or an alpine draw,1
952,Clove hitch in on a wire gate,1
953,If its hard finger cracks I might bring a little tape,1
954,If it's sketchy climbing and we're gonna climb on two ropes for a pitch I'll bring an atc,1
955,If it's a long climb with involved rappells in the alpine I'd carry my emergency knife for sure.,1
956,Ditch 2 of the lockers and combine the slings and cord on a single biner,1
957,Then it's perfect.,1
958,if you own an old Land Rover or heck even a new one carrying a spare alternator and belts as well as a fuel pump ain’t a bad idea,1
959,^^Ahhhh~ everyone would agree that it would be stupid to carry anything you don’t need on a climb....the trick is to have the experience to know ahead of time what that minimum is Everybody gets it wrong one way or the other sometime,1
960,Early on you’ll likely carry too much~ later on you may be caught short as you thin your margins,1
961,It’s a fine line to surf~ But in general~ less is more.,1
962,if you own an old Land Rover or heck even a new one carrying a spare alternator and belts as well as a fuel pump ain’t a bad idea,1
963,That's because LR's are a POS.,1
964,When climbing trad you already probably have everything you might need in an emergency in your rack already,1
965,Use your runners if you need to make friction hitches,1
966,Use biners if you drop your rap device,1
967,Two wiregates are as good as a locker,1
968,Etc,1
969,"As a side note~ it's funny that people on MP make such a big deal out of carrying ""too many"" lockers",1
970,If a few lockers are weighing you down~ maybe you need to get some modern ones,1
971,I carry midsized screwgates which are only 50g a piece,1
972,Grivel makes a tiny screwgate that weighs 37g - that's about the same weight as a BD hoodwire or a WC helium,1
973,One think I always have on my harness while sport climbing: bail biners! Whatever old snapgates I have in my gear bin.,1
974,True the weight doesn't make much difference and you can always use a locker as a nonlocker by not locking it~ but that just feels wrong.,1
975,Tell me honestly~ though,1
976,Have you ever seen someone carrying 10 lockers who is carrying the modern ones? I see (and have been guilty myself of this) people putting their gloves on a 90 gram locker,1
977,And their cordellete on a 90 gram locker,1
978,And their shoes on a 90 gram locker...,1
979,It adds up quick,1
980,When I sat down and tried to figure out the very best way to shave a lot of weight off everything I carried it came down to switching from old BD racking and alpine draw carabiners that were 43 grams each to Nano 22s,1
981,The 21 grams each savings x approx 40 carabiners total adds up to nearly two lbs,1
982,Same goes for reducing the # of big lockers you carry,1
983,That was me too~ although not with lockers...shoes on an old BD oval~ chalk bag~ BD oval~ nut tool~ EMS oval...all those oversized biners were heavy,1
984,But since I am carrying around about twenty pounds of extra fat~ that weight seems to pale in comparison LOL,1
985,Hell~ if it's bolted anchors you could skip all the belay devices and just use a munter I saw a Swiss couple at RRG using Munters and they were onsighting 13’s,1
986,It f***s the rope a bit but you can always run the kinks out,1
987,The Munter is as basic a skill as a rethreaded 8 and 90% of climbers don’t know it.,1
988,I experience is that this mindset pervades all of their choices in climbing.,1
989,(Not calling out Buster in particular on this one; his kit seems to have taken this into account.),1
990,This is very similar to how I got by rope back Saturday,1
991,The more you know the less you need.,1
992,This is very similar to how I got by rope back Saturday  Also how I unstuck someone's rope on a multi descent as I had passed their snag on rappel,1
993,They lacked this skill though the had the tools.,1
994,All the more reason to replace your chalk bag cord with a little bit of 5mm rope,1
995,Hey~ I just launched a kickstarter for a new hangboard design,1
996,I'm curious if y'all have any feedback - we can still do minor edits to our design before our full production run,1
997,Thanks!,1
998,Nice! That looks slick! Very cool for apartment-dwellers who are scared of drilling or ripping down their door frame,1
999,Could you make a picture that shows edge sizes and hold configurations (i.e,1
1000,2 finger pocket~ 3 finger pocket~ 4 finger edge~ sloper~ jug)? EDIT: Also~ could other hang boards be mounted easily to this setup? Perhaps you could make a tier with just the mounting system sans-board for those who already have a board?,1
1001,This looks like a great idea and could fit a need for a lot of people,1
1002,Board almost might have too many hold options,1
1003,I really like how the newer tension board just gives you a pull up rung~ 30 mm holds down to 8 mm; no pockets~ no frills,1
1004,What about making your door mount compatible with most hangboards? Just a thought,1
1005,Good luck!,1
1006,Are the pinches interchangeable? Could I mount a plastic hold instead of the wooden pinch?,1
1007,You would have to modify the board a bit~ but it would be relatively easy to do,1
1008,We actually mail the boards without inserts epoxied in yet (we include epoxy with the shipment),1
1009,Do you have a specific type of pinch in mind?,1
1010,Do you have a specific type of pinch in mind? Looking at using either a half dome or a rectangle pinch block,1
1011,With the rectangle~ would like to have ability to change the mounting angle so I can practice different pinch angles.,1
1012,Can you explain the value of having 3 different 30/20mm flat holds? If you want to train two fingers instead of three or four~ can't you just do that on a bigger edge? This is what I think some of the newer boards get right (e.g,1
1013,tension): more edge sizes~ fewer gimmicky pockets.,1
1014,Great idea! I'd love it if I could buy just the mounting mechanism (very creative)~ and not the hangboard (would prefer to use my own),1
1015,Any chance you guys will sell the mount separately?,1
1016,Can you explain the value of having 3 different 30/20mm flat holds? If you want to train two fingers instead of three or four~ can't you just do that on a bigger edge? This is what I think some of the newer boards get right (e.g,1
1017,tension): more edge sizes~ fewer gimmicky pockets,1
1018,Why not just leave some open space on each end and put T nuts there so users can add a pair of holds of their choosing? It would be best if the holds were mirror opposites~ but I guess you can't have it all,1
1019,(Or are there pairs of holds like that? I'm thinking that system boards might have them.),1
1020,Very cool design! It looks great,1
1021,Since I have been hangboarding more than I ever wanted to recently~ a few thoughts on function: - Agree that I would much~ much rather have a wider variety of edge depths than pockets,1
1022,E.g,1
1023,I love boards where you have 8~ 10~ and 12 mm edges so you can progress at or near body weight,1
1024,I find I use pockets very little,1
1025,- Slopers are useful for warming up (if they're easy) but not much for training since they're so conditions-dependent,1
1026,- Holds more than 20mm deep are good for assisted one-arm hangs~ but not so much for 2-arms since you need so much weight,1
1027,Also~ it's annoying to try to do 2-armed hangs when the hold you want is mirrored close to the center of the board so your hands are close together,1
1028,So..,1
1029,maybe put bigger holds for assisted one-arm hangs towards the middle and smaller ones for 2-arm hangs towards the outside? - Make sure you've chosen the best outside radius for the edges,1
1030,Hard to find something that feels good in all grip positions (e.g,1
1031,tiny radii/sharp edges feel good for crimping but hurt a ton open-handed),1
1032,Yes~ this is exactly what I want,1
1033,I hear you that it will make it a bit bulkier~ but don't put form over function here,1
1034,People have strong preferences about the hangboards they like and don't like (I do~ at least),1
1035,Putting an intermediate mounting board might not look as sexy~ but it's super functional and is where I think you're more likely to find a strong market of enthusiastic buyers.,1
1036,Yes~ this is exactly what I want,1
1037,Putting an intermediate mounting board might not look as sexy~ but it's super functional and is where I think you're more likely to find a strong market of enthusiastic buyers,1
1038,The problem is that form and function contribute to each other,1
1039,If your hangboard and mounting system don't look good~ then you won't leave them out and won't end up training as much,1
1040,Plus a bulkier setup would be more of a hassle for setup/takedown and would be larger to store,1
1041,But I like your points! That will also be much less expensive to manufacture without all of the milled features,1
1042,Thanks for the feedback!,1
1043,If your hangboard and mounting system don't look good~ then you won't leave them out and won't end up training as much,1
1044,Isn't the whole point of having the quick-release locks on it to make it easy to take down? I wouldn't care at all that it didn't look quite as sleek~ as long as I could take it down (which I would do even if it was the sexiest-looking hangboard ever~ because my bedroom door would be unusable with it mounted) and I got to use the hangboard of my choice,1
1045,I don't think it would really even add all that much bulk~ either,1
1046,In fact~ if you were planning to just mount a couple small campus rungs on the intermediate board~ it might even end up being less bulky than with the integrated hangboard.,1
1047,I'm working on a mounting-system-only alternative this week! I'll see if I can add that option to the kickstarter page on Thursday,1
1048,"One question though: What's your ideal size for a blank mounting board? I'm leaning towards 28"" x 8""",1
1049,Thanks for the feedback!!,1
1050,Maybe comb through here or a similar page and pick what models you'd like to support? Popular compact boards like tension grindstones and beastmakers would be no problem on 28x8,1
1051,The only question is whether you'd want to support behemoths like the trango rock prodigies that take up way more space,1
1052,I don't know of many bigger boards besides the trango one that are actually popular~ even though they exist~ so idk if that's a use case worth designing around.,1
1053,Sweet! Super excited to hear that.,1
1054,Hey!! I just updated the kickstarter campaign with blank hangboard mounting options.,1
1055," Awesome Design! If I hadn't already said fuck it and mounted to the beam in my hallway I would have bought one!  For reference I needed a mounting board that is a minimum dimension of 32"" wide by 10"" tall to mount the Trango Rock Prodigy",1
1056,Great idea adding the blank board,1
1057,Awesome! Just backed the project,1
1058,Really hope to see this be successful!,1
1059,What kind of shorts do ya'll like to climbin?  I want something form fitting and stretchy with a decent amount of durability!  Thanks in advance!,1
1060,Khaki/cargo shorts (aka korts),1
1061,Who cares about style when you have pockets for food or whatever?  Er~ not exactly form fitting or form flattering though.,1
1062,I guess i should be more specific,1
1063,I'm looking for something to sport climb in~ so pockets are not necessary,1
1064,I just want something that moves well.,1
1065,Lululemon,1
1066,Best sport shorts i own I found on accident at walmart~ Ben Hogan golf shorts,1
1067,Fit slim and have a good amount of stretch,1
1068,They breath well too and are like $12 a pair.,1
1069,Generally~ I don’t like Kuhl brand anything...but I ended up with a pair of their Freeflex shorts and they’ve become my sport climbing go-to.,1
1070,Prana Mojo,1
1071,Find them on sale and pay like $20,1
1072,Mountain Headwear Chockstone,1
1073,Super stretchy~ like 14% elastane,1
1074,Cut off mildly stretchy docker style pants,1
1075,I work in those and just cut them off just above the knees when they start to look unprofessional,1
1076,I’ve been pretty happy with my Gramicci G-Shorts,1
1077,Not the cheapest~ but they are comfy~ durable~ and I like how they look,1
1078,OR Ferrosi,1
1079," You want ""form-fitting""? Like Lycra?",1
1080,I assume so~ isn’t that what sport climbers wear?,1
1081,Adidas knee high or shorts tights cheap and work great for sport / okay on some trad depending on what your doing that day no offwidth or chimney action for these,1
1082,Super comfortable,1
1083,I like board shorts,1
1084,They move well~ light weight~ no or few pockets~ and lots of styles.,1
1085,Patagonia baggies,1
1086," A pair of ""military-surplus"" shorts that I got close to 20 years ago and have endured 7 years as my main climbing apparel",1
1087,They cover the knees~ have cargo pockets~ don't interfere in any movement~ and have been ridiculously durable compared to everything else,1
1088,They also work well in a wide temperature range for some reason,1
1089,Unfortunately they're almost to the end of their life and I haven't found anything close to replace them.,1
1090,+1 for baggies.,1
1091,+1 baggies,1
1092,Speedos,1
1093,This is what I wear: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Russell-Men-s-Woven-Tech-Short/132884286 (this link says out of stock.,1
1094,but Walmart usually carries a comparable~ even if slightly different~ pair in store) Not only for climbing~ but for everything in life,1
1095,Specifically for climbing and kayaking,1
1096,They are made from a similar fabric as bathing suit~ which means they dry quickly after sweat~ rain~ or river water,1
1097,They have a zipped pocket in the back which is great for storing a car key when swimming,1
1098,They have the tie strap around the waist to keep them from falling down,1
1099,And they're super light-weight and stretchy which means they're cool~ comfortable~ and great for climbing,1
1100,Edit: also~ they cost about 10 USD~ so they're much cheaper than climbing specific shorts.,1
1101,Grammicci makes a pair with a stretchy quick drying material and they are comfy and sexy as hell,1
1102,E9 Planet Rondo Shorts~ Moon Climbing Cypher Shorts~ and La Sportiva Levanto Shorts,1
1103,Basically whatever is on sale at the online stores.,1
1104,I very rarely climb with shorts~ even in full summer~ I only do so at crags next to the sea or a river at low altitude~ I never climbed in a desert so far,1
1105,That's why I only own 2 shorts~ the E9 Rondo Shorts and the La Sportiva Leader Short~ both light~ durable and stretch~ I can highly recommend both,1
1106,The 2019 thread was great~ so let's keep this going for 2020.,1

1190,Crazy deals right now on moosejaw+active junky,1

1192,I was able to swap out all my biners for 5.50 per camp photon,1
1193,I'm stoked! Did you do that recently? Because the lowest I'm able to get it now with that code is $137,1
1194,Did you do that recently? Because the lowest I'm able to get it now with that code is $137 Weird! It seems the regular items cost less than clearance items right now,1
1195,I did use a different code that was available at the time~ I purchased on Jan 18,1
1196,I think if you keep an eye on the website you’ll find the deal you’re looking for,1
1197,My guess is EB does these all the time,1
1198,Adidas/Fiveten has Hiangles for 105$ right now and an extra 25% with code JAN25 for a total of 79$/pair (roughly 47% off normal),1
1199,Activejunky is an extra 1% (booo) back,1
1200,Backcountry has same deal as well (last time I checked they had pretty much all sizes) + 12% active junky today,1
1201,Looks like they're trying to clear these out before the launch of the Z4s,1
1202,I don’t know about the deal~ but pay attention to their shipping expenses which could be as high as $30,1
1203,How you reckon? $14 x 0.3 = $4.20 in rewards~ $14 x .14 = $1.96 in cash back.,1
1204,"so thats like $6 ""off"" making them $9/ea?",1
1205,"so thats like $6 ""off"" making them $9/ea? Rack pack is $45",1
1206,$45 * (1-.30-.14) = $25.20,1
1207,Rack pack is $45,1
1208,$45 * (1-.30-.14) = $25.20 Didn't see/still don't see the rack pack so maybe its OOS,1
1209,I have ordered from T-P several times,1
1210,At least on the east coast~ shipping times can be better than most US companies,2
1211,I once ordered skis from T-P on a Sunday~ and they arrived Wednesday via DHL,1
1212,Yes~ shipping costs can be higher than we're used to~ but when you place an order to the US~ VAT will be deducted from your price,0
1213,That plus the generally better prices on ski/climbing gear can more than make up for the shipping costs if you spend a couple hundred dollars.,1
1214,"so thats like $6 ""off"" making them $9/ea? Each biner is $7.95 retail~ so all in with shipping and etc.",1
1215,for the second order that clocks it in around $5 or so a biner,1

1217,Good luck! They do various pct off deals all the time,1

1224,Nice find!,1
1225,An eBay search will find a seller with a few pairs of Anasazi Lace (pinks) in size 10.5 and 11~ for $59 each,1
1226,I purchased a pair from the same seller last month and they were definitely BNIB,1
1227,This is not a great online deal~ it's a shitty marketing campaign.,1
1228,AAC members...go get you your 20% and stack an 8% active junky on it in the meantime!~,1
1229,I have a pair of there jeans and really like them,1

1243,Mountain Steals has a few codes that are still valid  SAVE25 and SAVE35 they both have their own restrictionsClimbersLink.com pays 4% for Mountain Steals they also pay 8% for anything at Black Diamond and 5% back from La Sportiva,1
1244,I picked up a pair when they were $50 and they've been decent for the gym,1
1245,Definitely a step up from something like tarantulaces~ but it also didn't take long for the rubber to start separating from the rand,2
1246,Semi Totem Cam Deal: Campsaver - add 2 totems to your cart,1
1247,(in stock or out) two days later you get a voucher in your email for $25 off your cart,1

1279,I was having trouble paying with cc also...but paypal worked,1
1280,I think I had to try with a couple different credit cards when I ordered from them,0
1281,I may have had to do an extra security step as well (like a confirmation on my phone).,1
1282,When did you see them at 16$ ? They are now back to 21$,1
1283,Yeah I always think it is crazy to see 10 year old used cams for a 20% discount off of current price,1
1284,plus I never buy new stuff at retail either so..,1
1285,Used climbing gear prices seem pretty steep to me,0
1286,I think it's better to consume~ consume~ consume,1

1292,Like now  Really strange !!!!,1
1293,i wouldnt call this next one a great deal but if you make lots of smaller purchases~ GEAREXPRESS.COM is good (i built up a lot of my rack last yaer $50-100 at a time),1
1294,they have most of their cams at %25 off and free shipping over $50 so it's a good site if you're looking to get one alien revolution ($56 shipped)~ or one dragonfly ($56 shipped),1
1295,looks like the only thing they don't sell are totems,1
1296,they are based in utah~ i get my stuff in LA really fast.https://www.gearexpress.com/climbing/protection/cams.html,1

1298,Might be browser issues with EpicTV? Anyway~ I've been waiting for them to restock a shoe and they keep telling me a couple weeks~ but in the meantime I missed a 10% BananaFingers code,1
1299,Anyone know if they run coupons often or know of a code? I wonder since they're technically sister shops if they would price match~ EpicTV is cheaper but they're in different countries,1
1300,That’s~ scored my daughter an R1 for half off!,1
1301,Not a deal~ directly~ but probably valuable 411,1
1302,I had JUST bought my wife a new Patagonia Down Sweater at about 25% off (about $175) when~ just today~ that big 50% off sale included the same item,1
1303,I called Patagonia and~ just like that~ they refunded me the price difference,2
1304,Their official price adjustment policy is 14 days but I suspect they'd do that if it's been longer~ too,2
1305,Great customer service,2

2323,Hi all~  does anyone have experience with ordering a trigger repair kit from BD?   I have a broken trigger on a BD C3,1
2324,There's a round plastic grommet that holds the base of the wire~ inside the trigger bar - that part has broken,1
2325,Does the C3 repair kit that BD has on their website give you these plastic parts as well?  or just the metal wires themselves?   Link to product:blackdiamondequipment.com/e…,1
2326,Just the wire if I’m not mistaken,1
2327,Sounds like yours may be toast,1
2328,Ask BD~ they probably have parts laying around in a drawer,1
2329,Even if you can get your hands on the plastic part~ you wont be able to get it on the cable as they are threaded on before the cable is crimped/swaged onto the head,1
2330,I suppose you could maybe cut it in half and then glue it back together on the cable~ but not sure how well that would work,1
2331,I had a wire pop out of one of those and managed to pop it back in the little hole at the top and bend it back around the plastic slider,1
2332,Used a pair of pliers and hemostats,1
2333,Sorry if you lost the plastic part and this is unhelpful,1
2334,The trigger wire kits I have from BD contains no plastic parts at all,1
2335,"However~ they are labeled ""Trigger C4  BLKD 26024""~ so it might be different than the one you have in mind",1
2336,More importantly~ I've heard rumors that BD does no longer make these,1
2337,Does anyone have good suggestions for DIY material for trigger wires for C4 (the standard BD cam just before the ultra-light version)? I've a decent standard steel wire fitting #3 (which probably fits down to maybe 0.4),1
2338,However~ the 0.3 cam uses a much thinner wire into the lobe and I can't find material that is stiff enough,1
2339,"Any suggestions? (right now I'm leaning towards going all ""soft"" with  a nylon fishing line).",1
2340,You cant have soft trigger wires with C3's,1
2341,There are no springs in the heads of the cam,1
2342,They are below the trigger and push the rigid trigger wires to expand the lobes,1
2343,I've seen some folks use guitar/bass strings..,1
2344,a little janky but not terrible.,1
2345,Had this problem twice,1
2346,Had to send them in both times.,1
2347,Sorry for messing up this thread,1
2348,My comments were regarding the C4~ which is obviously a very different design,1
2349,My brain fart told me C3 was just a previous generation of C4~ which is NOT true,1
2350,Hello all~ I'm trying to get into trad climbing but I'm also a starving college student,1
2351,As I understand~ hexes are a lightweight and cost-effective alternative to getting cams,1
2352,Any recommendations on which ones are the best to get? Or should I just say screw it and purchase cams? Thanks!,1
2353,Buy cams,1
2354,Buy cams~ they are more versatile and quieter than the cowbells you reference in the op,2
2355,Love hexes,2
2356,Bomber,2
2357,DMM Torque Nuts are good (extendable so you save draws)~ Wild Country Rockcentrics are my next favorite,2
2358,If you’re getting the DMM get all four sizes,2
2359,For the Wild Country 5-9,1
2360,Don’t let the hex haters persuade you,2
2361,Purchase cams,1
2362,They've never been cheaper and~ unlike hexes~ you can generally resell them for good value if you end up not liking trad,2
2363,If~ after hearing that~ you still decide you want to buy hexes the best ones are DMM Torque Nuts~ IMO,1
2364,But~ seriously~ save up a few hundred dollars and buy a full rack of used prior generation BD C4s for about $250-$300,1
2365,I like the WC hexes much more than the DMM,1
2366,For endways placements~ the WC taper allows more bite into the rock and less leverage outward from the rope,1
2367,The DMM taper is bass-ackwards,1
2368,Cams unless you get a great deal on used hexes,1
2369,Learn about placing nuts in opposition so you don’t zip out all your pro,1
2370,Get “Mountaineering Freedom of the Hills”~ lots to learn and costs less for brand new copy 9th edition than a set of old hexes or a new cam,1
2371,Awesome! Thanks!,1
2372,I too prefer the DMM Torque nuts over any other design,2
2373,Wired hexes are useless,0
2374,Buy cams~ they are better,2
2375,Despite the multitude of hex haters out there~ hexes are lightweight~ versatile~ work in horizontals~ and are great to save for anchors,2
2376,For knobby flaring cracks hexes can be bomber in placements that wont take cams,2
2377,The dmm hexes are great and the largest BD hex is perfect for flaring fist cracks,2
2378,This is only a concern for your first piece of pro on each pitch and is easily mitigated:  place a cam for your first piece or use one of the bolts if its a bolted anchor or use the highest and/or best cam in your anchor,2
2379,I agree,1
2380,Op spoke of using only nuts on a trad climb,1
2381,I will add: “...highest and/or best cam in your anchor” on a multi pitch,1
2382,Even though I rarely use hexes I'd say yes get them,2
2383,Not the small ones (as small as a large nut) though,1
2384,You can climb with a set of nuts and a set of hexes,2
2385,You will probably want to dial back the difficulty and climb on stuff you won't fall on (passive pro is harder to place correctly and one set of nuts and hexes isn't a lot of pro so you may have some run out sections),1
2386,And it's even more important to have a mentor who can critique how and where you place your pro,1
2387,You could mock lead with this rack and start learning how to trad lead without worrying about falling on badly placed pro or runout sections,1
2388,But you could get your feet wet,1
2389,Then you could buy a set of cams and have the hexes as your doubles of those sizes,1
2390,Then you'll buy a second set of cams and the hexes will gather dust 99% of the time~ but you may pull them out for alpine climbing when you want to go light and the technical difficulty won't be near your limit.,1
2391,Scuse me~ what?,1
2392,Say screw it and buy cams and a set of nuts,2
2393,If you find yourself wanting doubles frequently~ get some (slung) hexes,1
2394,They're way more finnicky~ but if you're climbing below your limit they'll work for keeping you safe,1
2395,Once you get a second set of cams you'll likely rarely use them,0
2396,There are placements where only a hex will fit~ but 90% of the time you'd be better off with a cam,0
2397,They are great for anchors though,2
2398,Alternatively~ find someone with the skills and tools to lead and buy them weed and beer,1
2399,You'll be safer and learn a ton from climbing with someone more experienced.,1
2400,It can be an issue anytime the rope makes a big change in direction.,1
2401,Wired hexes for sure.,2
2402,Metolius curve hexes But~ generally~ don’t think of them as a substitute for cams,2
2403,Think of them as huge nuts - for constrictions,1
2404,Yes indeed,1
2405,I have huge nuts,1
2406,;),1
2407,Scuse me~ what? Let me clarify,1
2408,hexes are lighter than cams and harder to place on lead as anything other than large nuts so they are a good lightweight option to have on hand for extra anchor pieces~ and when you are setting up and anchor they are far more versatile than cams and can be placed actively or passively~ can be slung around a boulder or chockstone~ and are great for cracks that are parallel to the face you are climbing that face the sky on top of routes or pitches where rigid stemmed cams are going to get tweaked or a nut might not place due to the pull direction or parallel sides of said crack.,2
2409,Let me clarify,1
2410,hexes are lighter than cams  Not as much as people think~ though~ now that cam weights have been pared down,2
2411,Wired Blue Torque Nut weighs 161grams,1
2412,Same size BD ultralight blue cam is 167 grams,1
2413,Regular c4 in that size is 181 grams,1
2414,I sometimes carry a green and a red torque nut as a 2nd set in the alpine because I enjoy them,2
2415,And it's nice to have something that's easy to leave behind if you want to bail,2
2416,But the weight argument isn't so compelling any more,1
2417,^ Interesting because they look so much lighter,1
2418,A BD #10 hex is 5.78 oz a #3 C4 is 7.1 oz,1
2419,So the hex is about 80% the weight of the cam,1
2420,I would have though it was much lower.,0
2421,Hexes are a great first piece of gear to buy~ since then you will also have the first piece of gear you will sell,0
2422,Buy cams.,1
2423,Exactly,1
2424,"People used to tell me they were ""half the weight"" and I took that at face value",1
2425,Then I bought a scale and got curious,1
2426,Best way to save weight climbing is to replace heavy carabiners with light ones,1
2427,I wonder if hex development has stagnated since they are kind of an afterthought nowadays,0
2428,Cams have made steady weight reductions over the last 20 years,2
2429,Seem like hexes could have too.,1
2430,Not half the weight but you can have a large hex and a small Tricam or nut for the weight of a cam,2
2431,And you can get a set of nuts for the price of a cam.,2
2432,What more could you do with it? That’s like asking “why haven’t they improved the hammer?” It’s a basic design~ I’m sure it’s as light and thin as can structurally be~ no?,1
2433,I like torque nuts a lot,2
2434,Don't listen to the haters,1
2435,Hexes work well and are bomber,2
2436,Some rock also just takes them really well,2
2437,Now if you just climbing splitters I wouldn't bother with them,0
2438,If you insist on buying hexes get the dmm hexes,2
2439,I have the wild country hexes I bought off ebay for a good price when i was first starting off in trad climbing and even though i seldom use them~ I wish i had the dmm version,0
2440,Complete waste of money,0
2441,Theyre not as easy to set or remove as a cam,0
2442,I think wires on hexes really suck,0
2443,Also~ the solid hexes~ the small hexes~ suck,0
2444,Nuts are better in the small-hex range,2
2445,I significantly prefer the BD hexes~ slung w cord,2
2446,I have also used hexes as hammers~ slings~ and rappel devices,2
2447,They are good at belays~ cause you're standing in a spot to fiddle w em w both hands,2
2448,Theyre cheap to bail off of,2
2449,I carry them on long alpine routes~ because a handful of big hexes is light~ is another handful of gear options~ and if you have to build a dozen rap anchors to get outa there~ you have wide options,1
2450,Not all the bail cracks take nuts,1
2451,Protecting a 5.10 pitch w only hexes/nuts/tricams is Really hard,0
2452,You'll want cams to climb hard.,2
2453,What more could you do with it? That’s like asking “why haven’t they improved the hammer?” It’s a basic design~ I’m sure it’s as light and thin as can structurally be~ no? I would bet they could be significantly lightened with an engineered structure (as opposed to a solid uniform thickness wall),1
2454,Some old hexes had circular holes in them (probably drilled),1
2455,A modern hex could use a structure similar to cam lobes,1
2456,Look how much cam lobes have evolved in 20 years,1
2457,But probably not worth it investment wise due to the limits sales numbers of hexes.,0
2458,If you are new to trad climbing you probably shouldn’t be leading on hexes,0
2459,If I had to lead a climb near my limit with a rack full of hexes~ I’d be pretty damn nervous,0
2460,Cams are much easier to place and more versatile which you’ll appreciate as a new leader.,2
2461,#7~ #9 and #11 is all you need,2
2462," Picked up some of the larger WC hexes and found them to be very ""tinkly"" sounding (vs",2
2463,clanky),1
2464,So if the noise factor is important to you~ there's that,1
2465,I still prefer the BD/Chouinard style but slung on cord (vs,2
2466,wired),1
2467,Having said that~ hexes usually get left behind these days,0
2468,Sometimes will rack one biner with BD 4-7 on long pitches,1
2469,The small wired ones look attractive~ but (as someone said upthread) are redundant and rarely fit better than a similarly sized nut.,0
2470,I started climbing with hexes in the 70’s and early 80’s,1
2471,They work fine and are bomber when well placed ( and yes occasionally they are the only piece for some constrictions in a crack - but skip that placement and put a cam above or below it),2
2472,A cam allows many more options for use on a pitch and they are faster to plug in on hard leads,2
2473,They are also more versatile across many rock types,2
2474,As previously stated cams weights are now similar,2
2475,I still have a lot of hexes but only bring them into the mountains where I carry a few when attempting new routes as they are cheaper and I prefer leaving them behind if they are bomber in situations where I need to bail off the wall,2
2476,Just commit to buying a double set of cams to three inches (plus a big one) and some wires plus light carabiners  and you will be able to climb pretty much any trad route anywhere (except Elbstanstien where you need knots) with more safety than if all you have is hexes,1
2477,Hex placements make adventures seem more adventurous,2
2478,I hate to say this but when deciding who’s advice to take on buying cams or hexes it might be a good thing for you to look at the grade that those people who are telling you to buy hexes climb at,0
2479,I know it’s true that all the old greats used hexes back in the day and ‘they climbed so much harder than us’ but you can make your own decision if the people who are giving you advice to buy hexes top lead grade is 5.8 trad,0
2480,If you start looking at people that climb harder and ask them if they climb with hexes you probably won’t get too many people that do that anymore except for nostalgia,0
2481,Make your own decision obviously,1
2482,I’d buy cams.,2
2483,Funny you repeat what so many have said yet I see more n00bs with triple racks of cams flailing way more often than I see experienced climbers with a light rack,1
2484,I wonder why?,1
2485,I don’t think it’s rocket science to understand why beginners are flailing with whatever gear they have,1
2486,Beginners flail,1
2487,That wasn’t my point at all,1
2488,My point was when you start climbing higher level you trade in the hexes for cams because they are more versatile and convenient for when you’re on the sharp end,2
2489,Unless you’d like to show me modern high end climbers (or even 5.10 trad climbers) that prefer to use hexes (not for the old school feel of it) on a regular biases?,1
2490,Oh~ a higher level eh? I better go buy more stuff so I can climb at a higher level!,1
2491,A person can set a cam incorrectly but guess what~ a person can set a hex incorrectly also,0
2492,You’re using an argument that says that hexes are better because a beginner doesn’t know how to set a cam? I didn’t go to college but I think your argument is called a false correlation argument?(Correct me if I’m wrong~ I didn’t have a lot of the book learnin) It’s like saying a bike is safer than a car because teen drivers crash a lot,1
2493,I mean...it’s your opinion man,1
2494,I’m pretty sure the reasons people climb with cams is because they have more range~ more placement opportunities~ they weigh less and they’re quicker to place,1
2495,You might think that beginners don’t know how to use cams but people who DO know how to use cams choose them over hexes for a reason.,1
2496,I'm still climbing on Hexes I bought back in the 70s,2
2497,I change the cordage out every once in a while tho.,1
2498,Something I find really troubling is that some new trad leaders only use cams,1
2499,I actually went out with a guy who had a shiny new set of cams and didn't know what to do with the nuts I handed him when I said the pitch required them due to rock quality and placement options.,0
2500,This is exactly how I got started...it took 20 years before I had what might be loosely called a “set” of cams,1
2501,I rarely use the hexes now but they got me started with some hand sized pro for 1/3 the cost of the same sized cams and they acted as doubles once I finally could afford a few cams,2
2502,I say get a set,2
2503,You will use them and never be sorry to have another tool in the arsenal,2
2504,Also~ get the slung ones~ not wired,2
2505,Since my main crag is all single pitch trad~ I love building a rap anchor to be left at the top all day out of hexes,2
2506,Much smarter in my opinion than leaving $100 worth of cams unattended 95% of the day.,1
2507,I’m new enough and brave enough to ask:  What makes wired hexes less than ideal? Any when or all the time? Truly need the education,1
2508," ""What makes wired hexes less than ideal? Any when or all the time? Truly need the education",1
2509,""" I personally find equivalently sized cams almost always easier to place",2
2510,It's possible I am jsut a clueless gumby who is making choices because it's easier and faster,1
2511,Which seems okay to me,1
2512,The idea that maybe large cams are suprior to hexes~ and possibly nuts are superior to similarly sized hexes seems reflected in the racks of most of the folks I climb with or see climb (or guidebook listings~ or route descriptions or pretty much every place I see folks talk about what they are carrying),2
2513,Personally~ if price was the issue~ I'd just make it a priority to climb with folks who already have a rack,1
2514,Cause if you're learning~ it would be way better to be following someone who has been doing it already~ anyhow,1
2515,The fact we're mostly climbing with other folks~ and that their tastes and equipment may factor heavily in what goes up the climb~ seems glossed over in this thread,1
2516,I can't even get my partner to take my tricams with him on his pitches,1
2517,And I -like- tricams,2
2518,I have some old hexes from the 90s~ but I don't think I'd have any luck getting my partner to use those when we're climbing any more than my old rigid stem friends,1
2519,I can barely get them to agree to take the couple of totems that I have and like instead of their equivalent x4 cams.,1
2520,I should clarify: I have cams~ wired hexes~ tricams~ nuts~ and even one ballnut,1
2521,But~ what makes wired hexes less than ideal~ and in which situations are they less than ideal and in which situations are they better compared to slung hexes?,1
2522,One word: limestone! On low friction rock passive pro is your friend,2
2523,One word: limestone! On low friction rock passive pro is your friend That’s true,2
2524,I placed a micro cam in some basalt once and it did not inspire confidence,0
2525,I was sure it would slide right out before engaging,0
2526,I haven’t climbed any limestone at all but I assume it’s similar? Are there a lot of limestone crack climbs that protect with gear? I’ve only seen a lot of sport routes in pictures and videos,1
2527," Buy a bunch of cord of various diameters and build a ""Czech Rack."" It will save you tons on gear and you will look cooler",1
2528,The stiffer wire doesn’t allow the hex to “cam” as well as a sling does,0
2529," Go on ""weigh my rack"" and compare a similar sized slung hex and a wired hex",1
2530,Just for example~ the wired green torque nut weighs 15 grams more than the slung equivalent,1
2531,Oh~ a higher level eh? I better go buy more stuff so I can climb at a higher level! Wasn’t the whole context of this thread someone who was new to trad asking which hexes to buy since he couldn’t afford cams? If a new climber can’t place a cam correctly they sure as hell won’t place a hex correctly.,1
2532,Wasn’t the whole context of this thread someone who was new to trad asking which hexes to buy since he couldn’t afford cams? If a new climber can’t place a cam correctly they sure as hell won’t place a hex correctly,1
2533,A new climber probably won’t place anything correctly for a while~ but not a good reason to jump straight to cams -the heaviest and most expensive option - and bypass passive pro proficiency.,2
2534,Even when I first started leading trad I pretty much knew how to place everything correctly,1
2535,I wouldn't be trusting my life to gear I didn't know how to place,2
2536,I climbed with a few mentors,1
2537,Practiced at the base of climbs,1
2538,Then I took a course and the instructors gave all my placements a thumbs up before I led anything,1
2539,The drawback of hexes are they are harder to place correctly vs,0
2540,cams in 90% of the placements I see,1
2541,They're only are easier in constrictions (placing them like a nut) and I don't see that in CA all that often,0
2542,They are also not multi directional like cams,0
2543,They are usually more suitable places for cams,2
2544,Cams are easier and quicker to place,2
2545,IMO cams are safer most of the time for beginners,2
2546,Starting at least 10 years ago I don't see any proficient climbers in Yosemite carrying hexes,0
2547,Some advanced climbers don't even carry nuts,1
2548,The last page discussed weight,1
2549,The fraction of hexes to cams is 8/10,1
2550,Not much of a difference,0
2551,As I mentioned earlier I'd still recommend the largest 3 or 4 size hexes for a cash strapped beginner just due to cost,2
2552,They become the secondary pieces after your first set of cams,0
2553,And save a little bit of weight for alpine or easy climbs.,2
2554,That’s true,1
2555,I have not climbed on basalt but I would imagine it is similar! Tricams~ hexes~ ballnuts~ offset nuts and totem cams are definitely useful on Ontario limestone,2
2556,Regular cams work but the cracks are usually flaring and they tend to rip in parallel  placements,0
2557,Regular cams have to be placed in pods and constrictions,1
2558,The best limestone trad climbers I know have excellent nutcraft! Like anything~ the more practise you have fiddling with passive pro the more efficient you become placing it while cruxing out,2
2559,Maybe these days you dont see climbers in the valley or the creek carrying hexes or nuts~ but they are still widely in use,2
2560,Even on harder traditional routes,1
2561,And lets be honest~ it is much more intimate with the rock~ takes more skill and is more fun than simply plugging a cam.,2
2562,And lets be honest~ it is much more intimate with the rock~ takes more skill and is more fun than simply plugging a cam,1
2563,Well said Ty!,2
2564,Thank you for the excellent information!,2
2565,They are more prone to walking and getting pulled.,0
2566,One of the great thing with the Torque brand hex is the long sling,2
2567,There are a few ways in which you can carry them to mute the cowbell sound too~ by pulling some slack from the top of the hex and clipping that as well,2
2568,I have run out of slings and just used the sling from the hex as a runner clipped to a cam,2
2569,When setting TR's I can usually get by with a set of Torque nuts~ a set of stoppers and a long static line,2
2570,Don’t mute them for god’s sake,1
2571,That “hex sound” is much safer in Bear country,2
2572,Use cams and risk getting eaten by a bear,0
2573,Of course cams are most preferred,2
2574,Which cams? By following others and using their rack you will develop your own preferences,1
2575,In the meantime~ grab a set of hexes and nuts for cheap and get a bunch of easy leads in when u can’t be with a mentor.,2
2576,Gotta watch out for them multipitch bears!,1
2577,LOL,1
2578,I've done that too,1
2579,Hex wasn't right size for the placement,0
2580,Out of slings,1
2581,Stuck a Totem in and used the hex to extend,1
2582,Learning to place nuts and hexes first I think makes a better leader in the longrun.,2
2583,I don't know about better~ but more versatile for sure,2
2584,But I can't even remember the last time I carried a hex on a lead,0
2585,It would probably be sometime in the early 2000's,1
2586,Want to protect the damn funnel at Hawks Nest? Wired hexes,1
2587,I have only 3 small ones~ but you can pull them from my cold dead hands.,2
2588,They are more prone to walking and getting pulled,0
2589,How exactly do hexes walk?  They have no moving parts,1
2590,There are pros and cons to wired hexes,1
2591,The pro is the ease of placement due to the wire,2
2592,The con is that you always have to extend the piece! I have tried a few different styles of hex and I prefer the dmm torque nuts,0
2593,But thats just me!,1
2594,Great input,1
2595,Ease of placement above you/out of easy reach,2
2596,Wired hexes can be more difficult/not placeable in funky spots like pull throughs~ pockets~ and other weird spots where the constriction and the direction of pull aren't in line,2
2597,Slung hexes excel at these,2
2598,Also you can use them as extensions when your draws run out,2
2599,Not that I've ever had to do that...,1
2600,How exactly do hexes walk?  They have no moving parts,1
2601,As the ropes jumps and wiggles~ the sling wiggles~ and the hex will pivot around on its contact points with the crack,0
2602,Just like a nut can be wiggled up and out by the rope~ a hex placement can be manipulated,0
2603,The flat side of the hexis so large~ a small rugosity (sp?) or two can keep it for seating well with a tug,1
2604,Thats another reason stiff wires suck compared to slinging with cord~ and the bennefit of a long sling,1
2605,Incase it hasn't been said~ wired hexes are better for mixed climbing than the slung counterparts~ the wire holds up allot better to being pounded on by an ice tool,2
2606,Recommendation is to not buy them,0
2607,I only lost $35 on resale of my hexes YMMV.,1
2608,As the ropes jumps and wiggles~ the sling wiggles~ and the hex will pivot around on its contact points with the crack,1
2609,I've climbed with hexes off and on for almost 30 years and this has never happened,2
2610,Maybe because I have placed so many that I know what a good spot for a hex is and isn't,1
2611,Gotta watch out for them multipitch bears! You're joking~ but mid multipitch bear attacks have actually happened in the past: http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/2015/12/01/from-dawn-to-dusk-from-dusk-to-dawn/,1
2612,You're joking~ but mid multipitch bear attacks have actually happened in the past: http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/2015/12/01/from-dawn-to-dusk-from-dusk-to-dawn/ I heard that bears prefer the taste of gumby flesh!,1
2613,Well~ climbing bears are only one of your worries,1
2614,Tower bears are crossed with wolverines and are fuckin huge and ill tempered!,0
2615,You're joking~ but mid multipitch bear attacks have actually happened in the past: http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/2015/12/01/from-dawn-to-dusk-from-dusk-to-dawn/ i’ve heard of dropper bears attacking climbers down in arapiles,1
2616,scary stuff!,1
2617,I've climbed with hexes off and on for almost 30 years and this has never happened,1
2618,Any piece can potentially be moved in the crack by the rope,0
2619,Most especially in the alpine~ where routes wander and your rope zigzags,1
2620,Thats why slings are a thing~ because this is an actual problem,1
2621,Not all hex placements are bomber~ nor are all nut placements bomber,0
2622,Youre argument is bomber pieces dont move~ so nothing moves?,1
2623,Youre argument is bomber pieces dont move~ so nothing moves?   Your right~ but it would be physically impossible for that to happen,1
2624,Ideally~ the sling could be extended if the route wandered,1
2625,I have BD hexes that I used to supplement my rack until I eventually collected enough cams~ now I hardly use them,0
2626," I am not strongly opinionated as to which hexes to buy~ just wanted to back you up in your ""I am a starving college student""~ I get it~ and I think getting a small set of hexes (maybe 4 or 5) would be a good idea",2
2627,If you can afford $500 in cams from .3 - 3 then do that I guess,2
2628,My initial trad rack was a set of nuts~ 4 cams and a 4-5 hexes~ 8 lightweight draws and 4 runners,1
2629,Kept me safe..,1
2630,enough.,1
2631,I wear a 42 EU street and have EU40 Otakis just becoming comfortable after 5 sessions I have EU40 skwamas also 5 sessions but they felt comfortable after just 2 sessions,2
2632,I could have maybe gone to 39.5 for both,1
2633,I was thinking about Katana laces for a comfort fit but don’t want dead spaces,2
2634,After spending hours of looking through this forum and elsewhere I couldn’t reconcile the varying advice,0
2635,I have a relatively wide Greek foot shape,1
2636,Thinking about 40~ 40.5~ or even 41 for Katana laces as all day for mostly single pitch but thinking of getting into multipitch,1
2637,TIA just looking for specific advice in case anyone else has had a similar experience.,1
2638,I'd go for the 40.5's~ or the 41's if you want to wear a thin sock with your comfort shoe,1
2639,"My experience: I wear a 44 for LS Futuras/Geniuses as a ""performance"" shoe~ and use a size 46 TC Pro as my ""comfort fit"" shoe",1
2640,I almost always wear socks with my comfort fit shoes~ though,1
2641,If not~ I'd probably size them down to 45.5.,1
2642,You want an all day shoe~ buy one,1
2643,Don't try to fit your way into all day comfort by upsizing aggressive models,0
2644,That is my advice.,1
2645,I agree,1
2646,I've tried this a few times and it hasn't worked,0
2647,Bought Katana Laces a size larger for an extra comfy pair~ and they sucked for edging~ smedging and pockets,0
2648,Tried with Masais too~ with same result,1
2649,Like a TC pro or even a Mythos?,1
2650,Or Maestro...,1
2651,Like a TC pro or even a Mythos? Yes,1
2652,The advantage of the TC Pro is its comfort:performance ratio,2
2653,You can size them down and they’ll still be relatively comfortable after breaking in while retaining performance,2
2654,With the pointy toe and downturn you’ll have to size Katanas fairly big to wear them all day which may lead to dead space,0
2655,I’ve heard of people doing it but you have to have the right foot shape.,1
2656,The TC Pros and the Katanas are built on the same last and are both medium volume,1
2657,According to La Sportiva,1
2658,Yeah but the Katana Lace is a very different shoe,1
2659,It’s even a lot more aggressive than the Velcro model with the downturned toe and higher heel tension and with the lining doesn’t stretch as much as a TC,2
2660,I wear size 45 TC Pros on long multipitches while my 45.5 KL are a performance fit that I wouldn’t want to wear for more than 1-2 pitches.,0
2661,Is there a “black totem” equivalent for belay glasses or are they all generally comparable?  Guess I’m looking for a recommendation,1
2662,My mileage - stay away from plastic frames,0
2663,They flex a little~ prisms will pop out,0
2664,Not a big deal - a bit of crazy glue fixes it,1
2665,Plastic will also break in the most inconvenient moment,0
2666,"I like original ""Belay Specs""  - they seem to limit field of view least~ but my wife dislikes them",0
2667,"She prefers ""Y & Y Classics"" - metal frames",2
2668,Both work over regular glasses.,1
2669,I have been pretty keen on the Y&Y clip ups,2
2670,They flip up out of the way when you don't want to look through them and are more compact than other version,2
2671,Only problem is that the attachment clip to clip to your sunglasses or prescription glasses only accommodates a thin junction between top of lens or nose piece and the lens on the sunglasses or prescription glasses,0
2672,This is not a problem for prescription glasses as few have a large junction~ but many sunglasses have thick plastic across the top of the glasses and the attachment clip won't accommodate that and doesn't seem to accommodate being bent (part of clip is plastic and can't be bent~ the metal part of clip seems like it would break if you tried to bent it),0
2673,I inquired with Y&Y if I could bend them or otherwise accomodate my regular sunglasses and they just said they were built for prescription glasses,0
2674,I have a decent pair of sunglesses with thin junction~ so I just climb with those,1
2675,I rarely climb with my prescription glasses on~ but the clip up fits fine on those,2
2676,I have an old style petzl hard helmet with a pretty low rim and I have to tip up my helmet a tad to flip the belay glasses up and out of the way~ not a big deal and unlikely a problem with modern helmets,2
2677,My wife wears them flipped up when climbing and doesn't have issues (but not climbing hard stuff),2
2678,They have a small case that I keep on my harness and pop them into when climbing,1
2679,Nicer size format than the case for most other belay glasses,2
2680,I have their classic glasses too~ but always choose the clip up and my wife loves them,2
2681,I will try to post pictures of size of cases later.,1
2682,Agreed to avoid the plastic-framed ones,0
2683,Just find the cheapest metal-frame ones on Amazon.,1
2684,Some prisms are different from others,1
2685,I tried a couple different ones and couldn't use them,1
2686,Then I tried a pair that a friend got from Alex Megos that were quality from Europe and they never set my vertigo off like the others did,2
2687,I'm currently using the Metolius UpShot Belay Glasses and those aren't giving me vertigo either,2
2688,Only used them for a year so far so maybe the plastic will cause issues~ but so far~ so good.,2
2689,I like the belaggles more that the Y&Y~ but I am more used to them,2
2690,When I wear the Y&Y~ I feel like I have tunnel vision because the prisms are smaller,0
2691,That said~ as I have gotten older and ent back to wearing glasses~ I'll be buying the Y&Y clip ons.,2
2692,Sunglasses and neck pain have always worked for me,2
2693,I've used the Pitch Six ones and like them a lot,2
2694,I have an original pair of begoogles and the limited viewing angle makes them less appealing,0
2695,I got the $20 cheapo plastic ones off Amazon and haven't had an issue with them except that the case zipper broke quickly,2
2696,Then again when people complain of vertigo or motion sickness~ it's like a bear complaining to a shark that it's knees hurt,1
2697,I have no experience to interpret it through,1
2698,My partner has the Metolius ones and they work well too,2
2699,Just to give you idea of size of Y&Y clip ups & case compared with more traditional sized belay glasses (their classic version),1
2700,Those sunglasses have about the widest nose bridge that these clip ups would fit on - by that I mean it has to be quite narrow as the spring clips need to clamp onto the lens area near the nose and if frame is wide at top the attachment clip won't engage,0
2701,That being said~ the small format of these clip ups and the ability to flip them up out of the way while they are still attached is awfully nice (not affiliated with company~ my neck is just happy that I am using them),2
2702,I purchased some Belay Specs about a year ago,1
2703,I am quite happy with them and recommend them,2
2704,Easy to get on and off over a helmet~ fit well over sunglasses~ the steel frame and nose pieces are adjustable so you can make them comfortable for your face~ and the field of view is wide enough I don't get motion sickness,2
2705,The case takes a bit of getting used to~ but I find it easier than using a zippered case,2
2706,I tried the Y&Y classics (metal frame) and they were too small for my big head,0
2707,The temple arms did not extend far enough to reach over my ears comfortably,0
2708,The bend in the temple arms started a few inches too early~ so the end of the temple was resting on my ear instead of behind it,0
2709,I've heard good things about them but they just didn't fit me,0
2710,If they fit you~ they could be a good choice,2
2711,The CU Belay Glasses looked interesting~ but they were twice the price of the Belay Specs,0
2712,I've been curious about trying a pair~ but not twice the price curious.,0
2713,I have a super cheap pair that I use at the gym,2
2714,They are fine and sturdy enough,2
2715,I keep them in their case between climbs,1
2716,I paid around $25 for them,1
2717,Does anyone have recommendations of pads you can slide over the waist strap of backpacks to make them more comfortable? I have a BD speed back and the thin waist straps get pretty uncomfortable on longer approaches,1
2718,I found a single outdoor product one that works perfectly but they wouldn’t sell me an individual pad,1
2719,I'm sure you could find a shoulder strap pad intended for typical travel bags on Amazon that would work,1
2720,I’ve looked around a bit but surprisingly couldn’t find any that are short enough (6-7 inches).,1
2721,I've made a few (photos),1
2722,PM me if you want to discuss.,1
2723,These shoes look cool~ but it's hard to find somewhere to try them on,2
2724,Anyone have some info on the sizing of these? I'm specifically interested in the up lace,1
2725,I wear 42 in street shoes~ 41 in evolv shoes~ and 39.5 in scarpa,1
2726,Just wondering how these compare.,1
2727,No idea on lace-ups,1
2728,I believe there is a big thread on their shoes somewhere,1
2729,I bought Vim's in size 10 and their tight but fit,1
2730,I might go 10.5 in the future depending on how little they stretch,1
2731,I wear size 42 in Drago's and VSR's and 42.5 in the VS and lace up Instincts,1
2732,9.5 in the old Hiangle's.,1
2733,I have the Up Lace in 42 and it took about two days to break them in,1
2734,I am a 42/42.5 in La Sportiva~ 42 in Five Ten~ and probably like a 44 in Evolv (I've never had a pair that fit my street size without a lot of pain),1
2735,The Unparallels fit my foot a lot better than the Pinks and Miuras of the same size.,2
2736,I wore and 8.5 in the Pinks and wear an 8.5 in the UP Lace,1
2737,Size 10.5 street shoe~ narrow foot,1
2738,I love the UP shoes!,1
2739,Anyone use these shoes (saw another thread that doesn't answer my specific questions)? Wondering how they fit compared to other Scarpa shoes,1
2740,I have Vapor Laces (last yellow/black version) and 43.5 is tight~ 44 for more comfy but still tight,1
2741,Vapor Vs (older) in 45 are all day gym shoes~ but too big for anything above moderate (for me) outside,1
2742,The instinct line doesn't fit as well as Vapors~ too much front volume for the correct length,0
2743,Anyone compare the fit of Mago (new version) to these? I will probably order 2 sizes and send 1 or both back,1
2744,I've found little online about comparisons~ except one review said they run small and to size up,0
2745,Wondering if I should order 43.5/44~ or 44/44.5 (or even 44.5/45 if they run that small),1
2746,No local store has them or will order for me..,1
2747,Many thanks HfM,1
2748,I am street shoe 10.5 and I have the Magos in 43.5~ they are snug but comfortable,2
2749,The heel is kinda mushy~ which may have been less of an issue if I went down a half size,0
2750,I have 43.5 Instinct S and 44 Chimeras that fit similarly~ snug but not painfully tight,2
2751,Sorry I don't wear Vapors for comparison,1
2752,I really like the Magos for their precision and comfort~ personally I'm glad I didn't downsize too much even if they don't heel hook as well.,2
2753,Cool~ thanks,1
2754,Might try a 44 and hope for the best,1
2755,Probably end up a typical online shoe shopping fiasco.,1
2756,I sized up to 41 from my 40.5 Instincts and i wish i had gone up to 41.5 They are doable~ but gnarly tight compared to the Instinct fit and the heel is still baggy,0
2757,I imagine the heel will be baggy for most people regardless of sizing~ though i do tend to have a problem with a lot of shoes feeling baggy in the heel.,0
2758,Ok~ maybe 44.5 then,1
2759,I'm getting to old for ultra tight shoes,0
2760,One tip for baggy heels~ put a thin layer of silicone caulking in there where there are voids and spread it around with your finger (with glove),1
2761,Works pretty well,1
2762,Liquid latex might work too.,1
2763,Thanks for the tip! I'll try this on a cheap pair and see how i like it!,1
2764,I've also done similar on some shoes that shrunk up and became way too tight for me~ and I modified them for my wife,1
2765,Not perfect in that case~ but better than expected.,2
2766,Hi all - I am moving into my car in a couple of days after a COVID layoff in order to afford my student loan payments and also to enjoy some good climbing while I retrain to become a web developer,1
2767,I am planning to live on BLM land in central Oregon and hanging out at Smith Rock,1
2768,I have a small problem currently - I am trying to figure out a way to insure my gear (collectively worth ~15k) in the event that it is stolen from my car,1
2769,I am going to leave some things at a friend's house that I either can't secure while living out of my car (bike) or that I can't use in the summer+fall in Central Oregon (ice+alpine gear+portaledge),1
2770,That being said - I need to figure out how to insure the stuff that will occasionally be unattended in my car while I am out climbing,1
2771,Does anybody have tips + tricks as to how to achieve this? Renter's insurance requires an address~ which I won't have,1
2772,I need to secure my climbing gear since if it is stolen this will be a serious catastrophe,1
2773,I tried finding some specialty insurers - but all of the outdoor gear specific links that I was able to find are expired and no longer in play,1
2774,I'll be chatting with some insurance representatives tomorrow but would like some direction if anybody has had success with doing this with their own gear,1
2775,I will not be selling any of the gear~ since I will be using all of it at some point or another.,1
2776,Many insurance plans have an optional to cover a specific item or set,1
2777,Jewelry is a common thing to get this insurance for,1
2778,What I'm not sure about~ and maybe this is the crux of your question is how those plans interact with cars,1
2779,I know my renter's insurance covers my stuff except when it's in my car,2
2780,Comprehensive auto-insurance covers theft from a car~ but I don't know if that includes some limit that would be less than 15k,1
2781,The crux is not having an address for renters insurance! I need to figure out how to get around that (without committing fraud) - and the qoutes I get for comphrehensive car insurance can be out of this world..,1
2782,15k worth of gear takes up too much space in a car~ get a storage unit,1
2783,So far it fits into four bags (one haul bag stuffed full of ropes~ one haul bag stuffed full of hardware~ one bag stuffed full of ice climbing equipment~ and then my portaledge) which isn't so bad since two of those will be left in a friends gear room,1
2784,You can probably buy a “personal articles” policy from the same insurer who provides your car insurance,1
2785,But be honest about the fact that you’re storing this stuff in your car~ which is frequently parked in public,1
2786,The underwriter may decline coverage under those facts~ or may charge an increased rate,1
2787,What address do you use for your registration and insurance? Use that address,1
2788,Also~ you definitely want comprehensive insurance~ living van life means a higher risk of hitting an animal (which is not counted as a collision)~ hail damage~ damage from falling trees~ etc,1
2789,I pay $800 a year for some kickass Geico insurance,1
2790,My renters is another $200 a year but covers $15k with a $500 deductible,1
2791,MAKE SURE your renters insurance is for the replacement value~ not the current value,1
2792,That way you get a check for the cost of the item~ in new condition.,1
2793,When I lived in a car I had renters insurance,1
2794,I'm pretty sure that I took out the policy on my parents house and said I was renting a room from them.,1
2795,x2,1
2796,"you can even make a lease with your parents and pay them $1 to show money has actually changed hands for the ""room"" they are renting you.",1
2797,Travel Insurance? I recent went on a cross-country bike ride and got travelers insurance~ which also covers belongings based on your policy,1
2798,As it's meant for long-term travel you don't need an address to get insured~ but most policies i looked at had like a 6-month limit.,1
2799,If your stuff at your friend's house is of any value~ you can get a policy that covers that as if you have it in storage,1
2800,At least with USAA~ the stuff in your car would be covered by your auto policy.,1
2801,What address do you use for your [vehicle] registration and insurance? Use that address,1
2802,As a former vagabond~ I used my parent's address~ so use your parent's address or other close relative's address.,1
2803,Renters Insurance,1
2804,Find a way to use someones address,1
2805,Even if you viewed this as fraud it would be the equivalent of stealing from the mafia,1
2806,(except they wont break your knees),1
2807," The real issue with using a ""fraudulent"" address is that if the claim is big enough (and to my mind $15k is ! ) the insurance company might investigate~ and if they do get that far and conclude you were living ""on the road"" and not where you say you were~ then they don't pay off and you've spend money for the policy plus losing your stuff",1
2808,"Pretty easy to find out you're not where you say...couple of phone calls to the neighbors and/or requiring the occupants of ""your address""  to submit a signed~ notarized statement (""on penalty of perjury"") that you live there",1
2809,Hasn't happened to me~ but a car insurance company once sent investigators to where a friend lived because they didn't believe it,1
2810,(Rates were significantly lower than a few miles away.),1
2811,I told my renters insurance that I specifically want it to cover my stuff and I live in my van and they told me no problem,1
2812,Basically~ anything I own is covered no matter where it is,1
2813,If I left a computer at your house and you got broken into~ they will cover that.,1
2814,So..,1
2815,I need an all-day trad shoe for granite/crack climbing and kind of a mix of everything,1
2816,The TC Pros have always been on my list of shoes to try and they were on sale through Moosejaw,1
2817,I went to my local shop and they were able to price match them which was awesome BUT the clerk (whos opinion I do trust,1
2818,He is a long-time climber working at The Gear Room in SLC,1
2819,Respectable shop with solid people who actually climb...) anyway the clerk..,1
2820,"he said~ ""you known~ the Butora Altura is a better shoe for $40 cheaper"" (same price as the TC Pro with the price match sale)",2
2821,He went on to say that the Altura doesn't delaminate at the shoe bend like every TC Pro does~ it is hemp lined so it prevents stretch~ and the rubber is superior than the x-sedge of la sportiva,2
2822,Really it came down to fit for me,1
2823,La Sportiva shoes have always fit my heel very well and the toe box felt better,2
2824,And~ the Altura had a significant pressure point on the side of the foot near that boney bit on the outside edge,0
2825,So~ I went with the TC Pro,2
2826,My question is~ does anyone out there use the Altura and have you had any issues with the shoe? There are so many accounts and reviews of the TC Pro so I know what to expect but very few on the Altura,1
2827,Looking to see if I made the right purchase and if I should consider taking the brand new TC Pros back for the Altura..,1
2828,Let me know! Also~ maybe it's worth it to also bring up any other shoes that might compare to the TC Pro/Altura? What about the Five Ten Grandstones? Or maybe skip the hightops and head for a Katana? Again~ I have an affinity for La Sportiva purely on the heel cup and toe box fit for my foot shape but always open to try new things,1
2829,Nobody loves cause my feet are too big,0
2830,I ended up with some alturas because the TC pros aren't big enough for me (I wear a 48/49 depending on the shoe),2
2831,They feel like a pretty nice shoe~ but I've only been climbing with them for a couple of months so I can't give a long-term report,2
2832,The only other compatible option for me at this size are the scarpa maestros,2
2833,IMO go with whatever you think fits best.,2
2834,Might not be helpful~ but I got a pair of Evolv Generals and like them so much I sold my pair of TC Pros and I ain't going back,2
2835,I've got the orange Alturas~ and they take a LONG time to break-in,0
2836,Wish they were a bit more sensitive~ so perhaps resole with thinner rubber when the time comes and they'll be great,0
2837,Otherwise~ they're superb for foot jams and they're comfortable,2
2838,I've also found the LaSpo's to be a better fit,2
2839,I use my Katanas/Katakis for pretty much everything~ but when it comes to crack~ I switch to the Alturas,2
2840,The guys at The Gear Room turned me onto Butora shoes as well,2
2841,I've had the Alturas for 2 seasons and a pair of the Mantras for one year,1
2842,They both need a resole at this point but I feel like I've gotten good use out of them and they perform well,2
2843,The hemp tops definitely don't stretch as much as leather so I'm much more inclined to pay for a resole compared to the all leather shoes I've had in the past where the uppers stretch too much to be worth it,2
2844,I have a short and wide foot so I like that they have different width options~ although I was hard pressed to tell the difference in the store,2
2845,As with all shoes though~ it doesn't matter how high quality are~ if the fit is off~ don't bother.,0
2846,TC Pros are the best shoe out there!   I absolutely love mine and have for the 20 months that I’ve had them and used them on everything from sandstone to dolomiti to granite and from slabs to edging and cracks,2
2847,You made the perfect choice in my opinion!,2
2848,I'm happy with mine so far,2
2849,They are almost ready for their first resole,1
2850,They are stiff and well-built,2
2851,At first I had a bit of regret about buying them because they put a lot of pressure on my Achilles tendon and did not seem to be breaking in at all,0
2852,However~ they did eventually stretch enough to be comfortable for extended wear,2
2853,I can wear them all day now,2
2854,It is possible that they would stretch enough in width for you to be comfortable..,2
2855,but maybe not.,0
2856,I have a BD cabana + fly that I will happily trade for a good cordless drill with batteries and hardware to even out the deal,1
2857,Let me know if you are interested and I can send you detailed photos of the ledge + fly,1
2858,This should probably be in the climber exchange section,1
2859,Noted!,1
2860,The line from Mammut has been that the new 9.5 Alpine Dry and the 9.5 Crag Dry are equivalent (or even upgrades) to the 9.5 Infinity Dry,1
2861,The Alpine Dry and the Crag Dry have exactly the same specs as each other~ but not as the Infinity Dry,1
2862,Specifically~ the new ropes have more static and dynamic stretch as well as a higher impact force,2
2863,There also don't seem to be any reviews of the new ropes anywhere,0
2864,Has anyone used one of the new ropes? If so~ are they noticeably stretchier than the Infinity? In this video~ the Mammut rep mentions that the new ropes have a higher thread count which supposedly improves handling,2
2865,It would be great to hear from someone who has tried them out...https://youtu.be/JSmOUNdKRJQ,1
2866,I have the 9.0 Crag dry sender and it feels a lot more supple and smooth than the infinity dry I got last year,2
2867,Not much stretch difference but only a few falls to compare on the new rope,2
2868,Could someone explain to me how a rope with more stretch would have a higher impact force? It seems like the opposite would be true,1
2869,Bump~ I'm interested in OP's questions,1
2870,Additionally~ is this why the Infinity Dry seems to not be available anywhere (is it being phased out?),1
2871,The rope is a big spring right~ more stretch=bigger spring but if its a really soft spring it's not going to be able to put up much resistance in heavy loads so will bottom out quicker and more abruptly,1
2872,I imagine the harder catch is probably just tuning the hardness of the catch so it's a softer catch when it's around a ff0.5~ but I'm no rope maker so I could be wrong,1
2873," Do you think people take advantage of being able to wear out a pack~ shoes~ whatever in less than a year to just turn around and get a replacement for free? Have you ever had someone so habitual about it that you had to refuse a return?  On the flip side~ is it totally kosher to wear out some climbing shoes in 4 months and return them for a fresh pair because they ""wore out too fast""? If someone is just getting into a sport~ do you encourage them to try new gear and just return it if they found a better option?",1
2874,This post is a few months or years too late,1
2875,REI has tightened up their return policy~ and no longer owns this site~ either.,0
2876,Use your moral compass,1
2877,If it feels wrong to use gear more than to figure out if it’s right for you then return it~ don’t do it,1
2878,What some stranger (rei employee or random MP user) thinks shouldn’t drive your actions,1
2879,Think of the intent of the policy and ask yourself if you are abusing it,1
2880,No doubt! TBH~ I'm was more curious than anything~ especially with all the online orders people have been doing in the last couple months,1
2881,Personally~ I air on the side of just eating it than returning it,1
2882,Quite a few REI employees and managers would like to see the return policy made stricter than it is now,1
2883,No~ nobody encourages people to try new gear and just return it if they found a better option,1
2884,A certain type of person will always think of that idea themselves,1
2885,I'm inclined to agree with you~ if I picked the wrong product I'll just eat it,1
2886,If I made a decent effort to get the size right and it doesn't fit~ or if the item is defective~ I'll return it promptly~ otherwise I bought it and I'll eat my mistake,1
2887,I don't think I've returned more than 3 or 4 items since I joined REI in 1976,1
2888,Just keep in mind~ with most climbing gear it doesn’t matter how long you tried it out for,1
2889,As soon as the item leaves the store it cannot be restocked so everything you return is going in the trash,1
2890,Take an extra minute to try things on in the store and do your research before buying,1
2891,I've been encouraged by multiple REI employees to do just that in almost every section of the store,1
2892,You don't like this tent~ use it a few times and bring it back,1
2893,Climbing shoes don't break in~ just bring them back and we'll sell them at the garage sale,1
2894,I think it's a pile of crap seeing shoes that have worn through the rand at the garage sale with a note saying~ 'Only used once~' but not everyone has a moral compass that works.,1
2895,Do REI employees judge you for your returns? Yes~ absolutely,1
2896,In fact the record of your transaction history with REI has a KPI that scores your return habits,1
2897,How much did you buy vs how much did you return? They also track your lifetime profitability to them,1
2898,"""How much money have we extracted from X's wallet?"" ""How much more can we extract?"" Don't get confused by the bright shiny light over there",1
2899,Yes returns are tracked,1
2900,Yes your returns are tracked~ summarized and judged,1
2901,"But at the end of the day~ does the return policy (whatever that policy may be) drive profitable sales both short term and far more importantly~ over the long haul? Have you ever decided to purchase a thing you could buy at any number of retailers or ecommerce companies~ at REI solely because of the return policy? If the thought of ""I can return this if it doesn't fit"" or what have you~ moves or has moved you to pulling the trigger on an REI purchase~ then the return policy has driven your behavior and accomplished its one and only goal: drive more sales and drive more profits",1
2902,"If you become unprofitable and return more than you buy they judge you serial returner and your file is flagged and bam~ ""no~ sorry we won't accept returns from you."" = judged",1
2903,I’m an REI employee and yes~ we actually recommend trying gear out all the time,1
2904,Obviously we push that for things we can actually resell~ but if it’s like a harness or any climbing safety thing~ we try to prevent a return by doing a better job recommending products~ because like Lethal Weapon II said~ we can’t resell them~ even at the garage sale,1
2905,It’s definitely irritating when people return things that they’ve used for months before figuring out they don’t like it~ no matter what it is.,1
2906,I'm intrigued,1
2907,I didn't know REI actually denied returns inside of the 12 month limit,1
2908,Has anyone here ever been denied a return that they felt was legit?,1
2909,I've tried to return a bluetooth speaker a couple months after I bought it because the latch which covers all of the cable ports and makes it waterproof broke,1
2910,They denied me the return because I didn't have one of the weird useless mount peices it comes with,1
2911,I felt like that was an excuse to deny me the return~ maybe they thought I broke it on pourpose to get the return,1
2912,I look at it in much the same way as sending back food in a restaurant~ at least have a good reason,1
2913,I knew a serial REI return guy~ skis~ tents~ you name it,1
2914,Some of us were raised differently;),1
2915,That's a poor analogy for me,1
2916,I agree that a good/valid reason should be your basis for a REI return,1
2917,However a restaurant is a different story...have you ever worked in a kitchen or known someone that did? if so~ ask them,1
2918,I would never send for back at a restaurant,1
2919,Well maybe I would~ if i was planning on not eating whatever food came out next,1
2920,I do not have enough trust in humanity that someone didn't F with my food.,1
2921,Having worked at an outdoor retailer with a generous return policy~ the most egregious offender returned his stanky underwear because the elastic wore out after a decade +,1
2922,Yes~ we did judge him,1
2923,Last year or so there was an article about L.L,1
2924,Bean that highlighted the personalities/qualities of their employees regarding returns by abusers,1
2925,Worth the read.,1
2926,I do not have enough trust in humanity that someone didn't F with my food,1
2927,Excellent point! I guess the analogy works for me since I never send food back or return gear,1
2928,The saddest part of that story is learning that REI sells bluetooth speakers.,1
2929,Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral?,1
2930,Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral? Returning any item drives up the store's operating costs and reduces the store's profits~ thereby reducing my profit sharing check that I get every 3 months,1
2931,From a societal standpoint~ buying something with the intention of returning it later is essentially taking something without paying for it (i.e.~ stealing),1
2932,If people want to try something for a while to see if it works for them~ they can rent the item,1
2933,If renting the item isn't an option~ sell it yourself and look at the whatever loss you incur as a rental fee.,1
2934,I haven't liked REI since a rep sold me this: https://www.rei.com/product/157891/rei-co-op-flash-3-season-sleeping-pad Used it only in my car and on carpeting~ but after ~7 months~ the thing couldn't hold air to save its life,1
2935,I kept it around thinking I was crazy since it didn't have any visible tears,1
2936,REI wouldn't take it back because it had been something like a year and a day~ even though it was an REI branded product that sucked,1
2937,Insane to me that they still print their logo on it and sell it~ knowing how bad it is.,1
2938,I worked at REI for a short period of time,1
2939,Most returns were legit and most people genuinely wanted to only return items if they felt it was warranted,1
2940,I only judged people if they were clearly using the return policy as a rental program: returning skis in May/June~ returning mountaineering boots that had no defects~ etc,1
2941,This drives up costs for everyone and was part of the reason REI has dramatically changed their return policy.,1
2942,Been an REI employee at multiple stores~ and knew someone who was a serial returner,1
2943,He would buy shoes~ wear them for a year and then return them~ buy the same shoes etc,1
2944,After only a couple returns management caught on to him and banned him from returning anything anymore,1
2945,So~ he moved onto a different store and they caught on there too,1
2946,It got to the point where they knew his name / face~ and they would greet him when he entered and would follow him around asking if he needed help,1
2947,Eventually he went to stores in different states and they even knew about him there,1
2948,They never asked him to leave but they were passive aggressive enough to make him uncomfortable in the store that he stopped coming around,1
2949,Tldr: REI management tends to be passive aggressive af and they keep track of plenty of weird things,1
2950,Genuinely curious~ why is it irritating? As an employee~ how does it affect you? Is it irritating from a workplace perspective or from a societal perspective? What I mean is~ does somebody returning a piece of trashed gear make your job any more difficult/threaten your employment~ or is it just annoying to see someone doing something you see as immoral? Oh~ don't get me wrong~ it doesn't affect me at all as an employee,1
2951,Irritated is just the way I feel about people taking advantage of the system (and it is a very fleeting feeling)~ and in no way do I think the return policy should change just because there are a few people who take advantage of it,1
2952,I believe that's the price REI pays for having that policy anyway,1
2953,Sure~ you could call it immoral from a societal perspective~ but it's mostly just how I personally feel~ and I don't impart my personal feelings towards the people that make the returns~ or people in general for that matter.,1
2954,I worked at REI for a little over two years,1
2955,At least in my store~ managers would regularly deny returns if it was clear that you were abusing the policy (i.e high return rate~ abusing/using the product outside it's intended purposes~ beyond expected lifespan of product~ etc),1
2956,Ive returned stuff that didn't fit correct but that was known when it showed up on on my first outdoor use of the item,1
2957,I've also blown out gloves over a season of use,1
2958,I bought new gloves because I used the hell out of the first ones,1
2959,People who cynically abuse the REI return policy get reincarnated as a Dung Beetle,1
2960,Lloyd Anderson made the arrangements on one of his Himalayan treks.,1
2961,I judge myself!  I just took a 70M Edelrid TC Pro rope in and returned it after the sheath frayed after 1 sport climbing sesh (with no rock rubbing),1
2962,I am not a person that returns things just because I wear them out/abuse them~ but some situations are warranted,1
2963,It sucked to see that rope get junked as it seemed like such a waste~ but it was defective,1
2964," Over the years I have returned almost nothing that I have purchased~ even when friends have said I should just take it back and ""get a new one""",1
2965,Breaking an item you purchased~ using the shit out of it~ or taking it back because you found something better is not grounds for returning an item IMO,1
2966,Neither is using REI as a rental store for that matter.,1
2967,I've seen a few reviews in the blogosphere since these came out last fall~ but not much from real users,1
2968,Anyone here on MP picked a pair up~ if so what are your thoughts and comments on performance and fit? Saw two complaints on baggy fit in the heel on backcountry~ seems like it has a ton of heel tension on the rand and would be easy to size too large with dead space behind your heel,1
2969,My intent is steeper sport geared more toward edging~ so heel hooks aren't as important~ but I like to trust them when I need to,1
2970,Current go to harder sport shoe is old testarossa and I have a few pairs,1
2971,Use dragos for gym and most bouldering,2
2972,Chimera comes out when I need a hair more edging bouldering,2
2973,Shoes I've owned/have for refernce to compare~ instinct VS~ vapor V~ vapor lace~ skwama~ python~ katana lace.,1
2974,Bueller? Am I not seeing reviews because literally no one bought these shoes yet?,1
2975,Bump for some Mago love?,1
2976,I have 2 pairs and love them,2
2977,Super powerful~ very sensitive but really good support in the front position (big toe platform is v stiff),2
2978,Some people find a little bit of space under the bottom of the heel~ sort in front of the ball,0
2979,Behind the heel not so much a problem,2
2980,Overall~ the heel cup is pretty small relative to forefoot width,0
2981,If you like the instinct family you will likely enjoy magos as well,2
2982,I find them comparable to a chimera (big fav for bouldering) ~ although you also like dragos which i for one cannot get to fit in any size,2
2983,Magos fit similarly to testerossas (original model at least) but are much more comfortable with not nearly the same break-in period in my experience,2
2984,They should be similar as they were designed ~20 years apart by Heinz M~ arguably the most prolific/influential shoe designer in industry history,2
2985,The underfoot/wrap-around randing is way ahead of the teste design in terms of how comfortable it is for the power/precision it provides~ as it doesnt rely on the achilles-busting slingshot heel rand that many shoes past and present use to produce power in the toebox,2
2986,Imo they're sticky AF~ comfy AF for what they are (super high performance shoe),2
2987,They hook in on steeper than vert very well~ but also climb face and hard slab incredibly well,2
2988,They are just horrible for long moderate crack climbs~ so don't buy them for that,0
2989,:) Hope that helps,2
2990,I work in the rock shoe industry fwiw,1
2991,Side note they are blue-green~ colors which have been shown/proven to reduce stress and promote feelings of safety and wellness,2
2992,Maybe that's the extra step needed for the send.,1
2993,Thanks Alex~ great info in there,2
2994,The blue-green color scheme sure looks more soothing and harmonious than the McDonalds themed Testarossas~ which seems to mentally amplify greasy footholds ;) Sounds like you know your stuff~ so in case you're feeling helpful..,2
2995,I'm looking for something to replace Testarossas for edgy sport climbing,0
2996,Something that can handle a little hard-for-me trad/crack climbing would be ideal but I have tight TCs for that so not essential,1
2997,I have low volume feet with long toes and small heel,1
2998,Katakis seem close to perfect~ but are discontinued and can't find my size,2
2999,Instinct Laces were too high-volume (especially in the middle and heel),0
3000,I prefer to not have to size down too aggressively to deal with lots of volume,1
3001,Does the Mago seem like a good idea to you~ or any other suggestions? Feel free to PM if we don't want to hijack Nick's old Mago thread,1
3002,Cheers,1
3003,Any size and/or fit recommendations for the Mago? I fit the Vapor Lace in a 44 very nicely for semi-comfort,1
3004,A 43.5 fits tight as a performance fit~ and a 44.5 would be all day,1
3005,The previous generation Vapor Vs I wear a 45 as a wear all day gym shoe~ and 44 would be a performance fit,1
3006,The Instinct line doesn't really hug my foot and is a bit baggy for the correct length,1
3007,Nowhere near me has Magos to try on~ but wondering if anyone has a size recommendation or if they find the fit comparable with the Vapors? Found a bit suggesting they run small~ so a 44 might be tight and 44.5 might be the money,1
3008,Looking for a Euro limestone near vert to slightly overhanging shoe (Ceuse~ Siurana~ Frankenjura~ etc)..,1
3009,Many thanks,1
3010,Need to buy a swivel....today! Anyone know of a store that stocks them?,1
3011,Not sure but 3 possibilities: REI~ Metalmark climbing and Fitness~ Alpenglow in Oakhurst.,1
3012,Or the mountain shop in yosemite,1
3013,Just saw these~ and was wondering what people who have used the think of them,1
3014,How do they compare to a full sized ascender?  Is there anything a full sized ascender can do that this thing can't?  Just wondering if this is the future of ascenders.,1
3015,They work good enough~ and are lighter than most handled ascenders,2
3016,I've used them for rope-access work~ but not aid climbing,1
3017,I slightly prefer the Petzl ascender~ but might just be because that's what I'm more familiar with,2
3018,HTH.,1
3019,Another light weight hand ascender,1
3020,This is not an ascender~ it is just to help grab the rope.https://skylotec.com/eu_en/ringo-h-205.html#!information The photos on the site show that it relies on the user's hand to hold it to the rope,1
3021,I have one and use it more as a rope grab to haul a small pack,1
3022,I’ve used it as an ascender simply to go very light (I was using a micro trax as my other “ascender” and only to ascend a limited number of ropes.) I wouldn’t take one on an aid wall simply to lighten the load~ it’s a little bit too finicky for that~ you have to pay a bit too much attention to it.,0
3023,My girlfriend and I recently bought a tag line,1
3024,It's a 60 meter piece of 7mm accessory cord,1
3025,We got it for alpine routes requiring full rope rappels and for emergency bails in thunder storms,1
3026,We would have preferred to buy half ropes but couldn't afford it this summer,1
3027,The tag line was $60,1
3028,Maybe next year we'll get doubles,1
3029,We used the tag line for the first time on Petit Grepon~ which requires 6 raps to get off,1
3030,The raps were heinous,0
3031,We threaded the lead line through the anchor and tied it to the tag line with two EDKs,1
3032,I clove hitched a locking biner into the tag line and clipped the lead line through it,1
3033,"I was told that this was the ""biner block.""    When we went to pull the ropes~ (we pulled the tag line) the lead line and the tag line started twisting around each other",1
3034,The twists were above the knots~ so we couldn't untangle them,1
3035,We had to re-ascend the rope to fix this,1
3036,On the next five raps we didn't use a biner block,1
3037,We just threaded the lead line through the anchors and tied it to the tag line with two EDKs,1
3038,We didn't die,1
3039,The knot didn't get stuck in the anchor~ but I'm still not totally happy with our set-up,1
3040,So tips? How do you set up raps when using a lead line and a tag line? What knots do you use? How of you avoid death and tangles?   Thanks for your responses,1
3041,And for the record~ I've already read Freedom of the Hills ;),1
3042,You only rapped on the fatter line~ right?    I don't understand how the twists occurred,1
3043,You didn't have any free-hanging rappels~ did you?,1
3044," I've always understood the blocking binder to be for a ""reepschnur"" setup~ where the lead line bears all the weight of the rappeller and the tag line not only isn't threaded through the rappel device~ it may not even be strong enough to hold body weight",1
3045,I've seen the reepschnur described and diagrammed here on MP~ and what I saw looked kind of scary,1
3046,I used a 7mm accessory cord tag line the way you described many years ago~ but I never used a blocking biner,1
3047,I just tied the tag line and my lead rope together using either a double fisherman's or a EDK~ and left a long tail if I was using a EDK,1
3048,If we were doing multiple rappers We would feed the side we were pulling into the next rap anchor to save time~ so half the time the tag line was through the anchor and half the time the lead line was through the anchor,1
3049,The only problems I recall we're that the 7mm was more susceptible to abrasion than a fatter line~ and I it was more likely to jam in a crack while being pulled after a rappel,1
3050,The light weight and low cost were really nice~ but rapping on a 7mm line so many partners nervous that I went to an 8mm tag line,1
3051,The other problem was that~ if the tag line was through the anchor~ the knot would creep down from the anchor because of the difference in friction between the tag line and the lead line,1
3052,We had to watch the ends carefully to keep from going off the end of the 7mm line~ even if we started the rappel with the rope ends perfectly even,1
3053,People get nervous about rapping on a 7mm line~ but the truth is that it's plenty strong,1
3054,When hexes were still widely used~ it was normal to sling them with 7mm accessory cord or smaller.,1
3055,I think if the rope is pulled over a tight angle as it pulls~ it will twist and kink up like that,1
3056,I have only seen that if you thread the rope through the bolt directly~ but I'm sure you didn't do that,1
3057,What tag line did you get? I'm in the same boat and need to buy a tag line but I can't find one for that cheap,1
3058,A link would be great.,1
3059,We have used the 7 mil static tag line + lead rope system for years,1
3060,Since the tag line goes through the rap device easier~ it will creep unless you thread the lead line  through the anchor as you did,1
3061,As for a knots~ we just tie a figure 8 in one rope and connect it to a figure 8 in the other (figure 8 to figure 8),1
3062,The only drawback is that you always have to pull down the tag line on multi-raps~ so if a rope gets stuck on the way down it's likely to be the lead line,1
3063,Our system has never twisted up as you described,1
3064,What was so heinous about the raps on the Petit?,1
3065,i use the biner block you have described all the time i have never had an issue with tangling that you described,1
3066,What this the first time that you used the 7 mm cord? because the new cords often come in a spool and need some time to get the kinks out,1
3067,also~ I have comment about using two EDK~ although it would have nothing to do with the tagle,1
3068,The EDK is a good knot to use on rappel because it is compact and can flip,1
3069,The down side of the knot is that is a relatively weak knot and the tails do slip,1
3070,Adding a second EDK make the knot way more prone to getting stuck and have little effect on tail slippage,1
3071,So it is best to make a decision either go with a knot that is less likely to get stuck (EDK)or use a strong knot (double fishermen),1
3072,Presently you are using a weak knot that is most likely to get stuck.,1
3073,It sounds like you're mixing two different methods,1
3074,Method 1: normal two-rope rap,1
3075,Thread the single rope~ join to tag line (EDK)~ rap on both strands~ pull tag line,1
3076,Method 2: biner block,1
3077,Thread the single rope~ tie to locker (overhand/figure-8 on bight)~ lock back to single rope on other side of anchor (note that single is now self-secure)~ tie tag line to locker~ rap on single rope only~ keep control of tag line (clip to draw on gear loop~ for example)~ pull tag line,1
3078,It sounds like you did a little bit of both,1
3079,With the EDKs and biner up there~ I'm not surprised that you had problems,1
3080,I personally do method 2,1
3081,Method 1 seems odd and perhaps unsafe due to the different rope diameters and types (static vs dynamic) through the rap device,1
3082,Regardless~ you're pulling big knots and potentially a big biner,1
3083,There's definitely potential to get stuck,1
3084,Always good to do the test pull while your partner is still up there,1
3085,Also~ it's totally up to you~ but you might want to reconsider two EDKs,1
3086,For me~ one properly-dressed EDK with plenty of tail is safe enough and much less prone to snagging.,1
3087,Also~ EDKs don't slip~ they roll,1
3088,There are some really good tests out there that IMO show that a properly-dressed single EDK with tail is bomber.,1
3089,Did you tie both ends of the rap line together for a stopper knot? ..,1
3090,Or did you throw them down independently?   ;),1
3091,Only marginally off topic~ an overhand knot is only an EDK if the tails are so short that when the knot rolls over on itself~ the tails roll in and the knot comes undone,1
3092,Like someone else said~ consider using only one overhand knot to join the ropes or switch to using a double fisherman's,1
3093,You will have a less tangle-prone setup.,1
3094,I have always rigged the rap so that I pull on the lead line,1
3095,This is easier to pull since the lead line is heavier and also if a rope hangs up it is likely to be the tag line,1
3096,The disadvantage is that the ropes creep~ but this isn't a problem rapping off a metal ring,1
3097,Just never rappel this way off webbing.,1
3098,Thanks for your responses,1
3099,To answer a few questions,1
3100,I bought the line at outdoor recreation in SLC,1
3101,They only charged us $0.30 a foot and I think it was a favor,1
3102,The line was brand new~ which may have contributed to the twisting,1
3103,The raps were heinous just bc of tangle,1
3104,Repairing that situation lost us time getting back to the ground,1
3105,When I got back down I discovered that marmots ate the tongues off my hiking shoes,1
3106,But that's a different story,1
3107,What y'all are saying about one edk or double fishermens makes sense,1
3108,I think I will use a double fishermens and no biner block,1
3109,Last time I put both  strands through the ATC,1
3110,I think I will continue with that.,1
3111,I also like the idea of not throwing the tag line~ but just moving it in and out of a small rope bag or stuff sack,1
3112,As for the tangling..,1
3113,Man I really don't understand it,1
3114,We started pulling the tag line,1
3115,The knot came of the edge towards us,1
3116,I could see the knot moving,1
3117,After a few feet~ the tagline became impossible to pull and I could see the ropes tangled around each other high up on the rope,1
3118,The lead line was still near us~ which means we probably didn't pull down more than 15 ft of tagline,1
3119,We ended up securing the tag line to me and the anchor~ then my partner climbed and self-belayed up the lead line with a GriGri,1
3120,When she got to the tangles~ she built an anchor~ went off rappel~ untangles the ropes and then rapped back down the lead line taking the anchor with her,1
3121,Maybe we threaded the ropes through the anchor in some weird way,1
3122,I don't know,1
3123,The whole things was baffling.,1
3124,Could it be that accessory cord is wound onto a narrow spool~ and this tight winding makes it kink like crazy in 60m lengths?  I bought a tagline which was a 60m piece of static cord~ it was coiled like a new rope with no tight coils,1
3125,If you can hang your tagline free from one end~ it may get most of the kinks out,1
3126,Then butterfly it~ don't wind it into a coil.,1
3127,I've seen where pulling a rope through an anchor that has only one rap ring per bolt can twist the rope,1
3128,If the rap rings are directly attached to the bolt~ there should be two per bolt (linked like a chain),1
3129,Don't know the configuration of your rap anchors,1
3130,Or if they were even bolted anchors.,1
3131,We were instructed that the methods suggested here weren't as safe as two figure 8s,1
3132,Are you guys sure about the EDK or double fishermans with two different diameters and types of rope?,1
3133,yes~ I am sure,1
3134,but don't take my word for it..,1
3135,user.xmission.com/~tmoyer/t… blackdiamondequipment.com/e… figure 8   overhand,1
3136,Alright Mr Archibald,1
3137,Here is everything you need to know: EDK is totally good,1
3138,Different diameter ropes are even stronger than same size 8mm,1
3139,If you want a small back up because of your comfort level with the knot~ that is fine,1
3140,Just tie the EDK~ then put a neat~ overhand in one strand and push it up to the EDK to reduce the likelihood of rolling which is next to nil anyway,1
3141,Also~ with different diameter ropes~ be sure the skinny one is one the rap side~ not the tail side,1
3142,This makes rolling more difficult,1
3143,But~ EDK's don't fail,1
3144,Biner block,1
3145,Totally unnecessary unless rapping with grigri,1
3146,Makes pulling ropes a bitch,1
3147,The only place we need  {edited out by Admin}  Tangles on the petit,1
3148,Let me guess~ it was the second rappel,1
3149,Here~ the terrain is a bit slabby and the two ropes can wrap around each other quite easily,1
3150,Trust me~ I've been there~ specifically on that rappel,1
3151,And these twist are super strong and makes it nearly impossible to pull the ropes,1
3152,Kind of like a prussic with 10 or 20 wraps,1
3153,Nothing to do with new ropes~ etc,1
3154,To prevent~ just keep tension in the tag line once the last person raps to avoid this,1
3155,Rope creep with different diameter ropes? No problem,1
3156,Clip into both ropes for the rappel as normal,1
3157,Add an additional biner to the skinny rope to increase friction on it,1
3158,Works well,1
3159,Have the second rappeller waiting at the achor watch for rope creep~ and grab it if necessary to stop it,1
3160,Then~ when the second raps~ the first rapper on the ground or at next anchor can hold onto the skinny line to control rope creep,1
3161,BTW~ the petit can easily be done in 5 raps,1
3162,From the top~ rap to the Fixe anchors 160 down and slightly left,1
3163,Then~ on the second rap~ locate the large grassy ledge 210 feet below,1
3164,Rap carefully to your rope ends and down climb 10 feet of easy terrain (5.2?) to the large grassy ledge,1
3165,Do the next 3 raps as normal.,1
3166,when pulling your ropes for the next rap I always toss or lower (as im pulling the lead) as much tag line as possible,1
3167,We found that usually ends up being half or more of the tag line,1
3168,Then you thread and toss your lead line...having tied off your tag on a bight beforehand so you don't lose is after lowering the majority and pulling yr ropes overhead,1
3169,This method guarantees that not only will your ropes not wrap each other up when tossing~ but (more importantly) keeps the skinny tag from snarling itself something fierce when you try to toss the full 60m at once,1
3170,Also~ whenever tossing any amount of tag always feed out a solid 40 feet of tail off the coil...keeps that tails from threading loops on the way down,1
3171,Yer still gonna die though,1
3172,:),1
3173,Another thread about EDK strength and tag lines,1
3174,Please punch me in the balls now,1
3175,How about a new rule that says any post made about a topic that has already been covered at least 20 times in the last revolving year is deleted on the spot?,1
3176,Maybe I am not making this as hard and I need to~ so surely I will die,1
3177,I join my lead line to an 8mm tag line with an EDK and rap off of both strands,1
3178,Thread the rope I am pulling at the next set of rings~ alternate pulls and repeat until I am on the ground,1
3179,20 years later I am still here,1
3180,Am I missing something,1
3181,Why is this so complicated?,1
3182,And~ make sure you tie knots into the end of everything like they tell you in the textbooks,1
3183,Otherwise~ your rope won't get wedged in every crack and stuck up at the anchor like it should when you pull it.,1
3184,Hmmm..,1
3185,Never seen that 'biner set up before,1
3186,Years ago I used to get off waterfalls in the,1
3187,Canadian Rockies using a 100m,1
3188,7mm and then 6mm rope~ no I didn't die,1
3189,I think the 'biner may contribute to jamming~ I always used the two overhand knot arrangement to join tag line and climbing rope and rappelled off  both using an ATC,1
3190,Anything smaller than an 8mm is pretty squirrelly though and must be constantly monitored,1
3191,Last time I used a 7mm was descending the Super Couloir  and I am NEVER using a 7mm line for this again~ way too fast in an ATC and difficult to control descent rate...,1
3192,Not funny~ gratuitous~ and in super bad taste too.,1
3193,All this other debate aside~ Gred D nailed it,1
3194,It was the second rap on Petit where the tangle occurred.,1
3195,^^^^ Thank you for your long winded yet mostly irrelevant explanation,1
3196,"    ""I didn't say that I agreed with him or that he is correct""",1
3197,Yet you quote him~ hmm,1
3198,So he made you think,1
3199,Does that equate to a fact,1
3200,If you have a link to a situation where someone burned through their rap line while rapping~ that would be useful,1
3201,Instead~ you cite a situation where the system failed~ then the rope zipped through the rings at an extremely fast rate~ generating tremendous heat,1
3202,Nothing like rappelling heat,1
3203,Ah~ the internet.,1
3204," politically incorrect or not~ I thought that ""biner block on the border"" joke was pretty funny.",1
3205,120 meter skinny lead ropes,1
3206,Now there is your answer.,1
3207,Scratch the 2x EDK...all you need is the Mickey Mouse Knot,1
3208,It's the EDK with an overhand on both tails~ tightly cinched to the EDK,1
3209,Frank Sanders~ of the Devils Tower~ showed this to me years ago,1
3210,Also~ trust what Greg D,1
3211,"""from Here"" is saying...he may be a jerk~ but he does know what he is talking about.",1
3212,Same thing just happened to us yesterday,1
3213,It absolutely baffled us,1
3214,Fortunately~ it was a brand new tag line and so my main goal was to tag it behind while climbing to get the rope flaked properly,1
3215,The rappel route was odd enough for serious potential of ropes getting stuck on the pull and the rap stations were 35m apart so we ended up deciding not to rap off the tag line until the last rappel,1
3216,But when we got to the ground and pulled the tag line~ all these twists formed in the rope to an extent that two of us could not get the lead rope to move,1
3217,I am still perplexed by what happened but I’m now guessing that there must have been hidden twists in the tag line from it being on a coil and being brand new,1
3218,I saw someone using a Purcell prusik as a pas the other day and quite liked the idea,1
3219,Made me think of the dyneema whoopee slings I made for my hammock,1
3220,Has anyone tried using one as an adjustable pas? Is it too finicky to quickly adjust? I personally have no qualms regarding their strength - dyneema is strong shit (I've got some 4mm SK78 Marlow d12 laying around that I was thinking of using~ min/avg breakload 1850kg/2060kg) and I've worked doing rigging on yachts so my splicing is up to snuff,1
3221,But please weigh in if you think I'm gonna die :-),1
3222,I’ve played with it over the years~ and not found it worthwhile and takes 2 hands to lengthen.,1
3223,I’ve played with it over the years~ and not found it worthwhile and takes 2 hands to lengthen,1
3224,Damn that's a small bury!,1
3225,It would make sense that vectran would work better but alas all I have is the 4mm dyneema which is super slippery especially with the coating it has,1
3226,"Why would you purposefully design yours to slip at 5kn? Did you have a knot in the end to stop it pulling through or an eye to attach back to a biner/tie in loops to make it a ""closed"" system? (Actually now that I say this~ did you lark hitch that eye on the fixed end directly to your tie in loops or have it on a locker? Was chafe an issue?)",1
3227,Yup~ a very short bury~ and intentional,1
3228,These things hold by friction~ and reducing the bury reduces the friction~ thereby allowing you to get it to slip at a known force,1
3229,It was remarkably consistent too,1
3230,There is a butt splice on the end~ and found that the larger diameter would not pull through when loaded,1
3231,Had done others with a loop on the end that would be clipped to the loaded loop as well,1
3232,This was all part of digging into using them as reusable textile screamers~ and combining several into a self-equalizing~ load limiting anchor,1
3233,Worked quite well in slow pull tests~ but never got around to drop tests and no longer have multiple strain gage indicators~ so can’t do multipoint force measurement and won’t be revisiting it,1
3234,Anyway~ I found it to work in dyneema too and only showed vectran as I knew where that one was,1
3235,Bury needs to be longer with dyneema due to how slippery it is,1
3236,I tried pobon and technora as well~ and did not like how they behaved,1
3237,The vectran and dyneema got a bit fuzzy after 20 or so pulls~ but still slipped at the expected force,1
3238,Seems I did not post a chart of it in the other post~ but did share a page of my notes:  mountainproject.com/forum/t… But as for using Whoopi slings in general~ arborists do it all the time~ so likely safe.,1
3239,I'm spending a bunch of time there later this summer,1
3240,I'll be doing a lot of long approaches in scree fields~ boulder fields~ bushwhacking~ etc,1
3241,Ideally they could handle long dusty approaches~ some stream crossings~ and lengthy class 3 and 4 routes,1
3242,Previously I would have just wore trail runners and then switched to a rock climbing shoe~ but if I could get the benefits of both in one pair of shoes~ that'd be ideal,1
3243,Any suggestions? I've had the La Sportiva TX3 recommended,1
3244,Sort of difficult to shop for shoes right now because retail hasn't opened up yet.,1
3245,I'd go with the tx4s over the 3 if you want them to last with heavy shwacking and scree field use,1
3246,Same shoe~ just with a leather upper that's more durable than the mesh,1
3247,Youll probably want to take them off for submerged stream crossings though,1
3248,Any approach shoe will be fine,1
3249,I think it's important to prioritize qualities in a shoe~ i.e.~ what's important to you,1
3250,For me~ here are the priorities in descending order:,1
3251,Depending of what fit you best I would either go for la sportiva tx4 or scarpa mescalito (my choice),1
3252,Incoming waterproof vs,1
3253,breathable shoes debate,1
3254,I vote TX3,1
3255,The approaches in the Sierra are generally hot and sunny~ and the leather upper of the TX4 doesn't breathe as well as the mesh on the TX3,1
3256,Also~ the mesh TX3 dries a lot quicker than the leather TX4,1
3257,TX3 is lighter too,1
3258,I'm not a fan of waterproof shoes~ which usually keep more moisture in than they keep out when it comes to summer mountaineering,1
3259,The TX4 does have the advantage of durability for skiing scree or actual climbing~ but I'd still go with the TX3~ which will easily last a summer full of Sierra adventures,1
3260,I find the TX series very comfortable~ even with a big pack~ and it climbs quite well if it comes to that,1
3261,With the laces loosened~ it's a nice camp slipper too,1
3262,Great shoes~ I'm on my third pair.,1
3263,I agree on non-waterproof shoes,1
3264,Sierras were pretty damn dry this Winter anyways,1
3265,By late Summer you could easily avoid getting your feet wet~ even at high elevations~ with non-waterproof shoes.,1
3266," I do exactly this in 20-year-old New Balance lightweight (but not ""ultralight"") running shoes",1
3267,"""Waterproofness"" is not only unnecessary but likely counterproductive.",1
3268,Interesting comments on waterproofness,1
3269,Those were my priorities,1
3270,If that isn't important to you~ there's no debate from me! I haven't had a problem with retaining moisture or overheating because of waterproof shoes,1
3271,Note that I gave specific conditions (wet!) where I'd use them,1
3272,I don't even have any waterproof approach shoes~ but I do have some hiking shoes that are,1
3273,And they only provide limited protection from water,1
3274,Not sure this digression helps the OP,1
3275,Here are some reviews on approach shoes:https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/climbing/best-approach-shoes,1
3276,Plenty of high Sierra approaches in scarpa gecko (big fan) and the scarpa crux (midsole wore out too much for my liking),1
3277,Have Some friends who have enjoyed the tx3,1
3278,If dealing with lots a scree~ might be worth getting a mid shoe or maybe some light gaiters? Eh~ stuff fills your shoes regardless~ never mind,1
3279,If I expect any technical scramble~ like high Sierra class 3/4~ I love the Gecko,1
3280,Not awesome for anything over a 5-7 mile approach but I’ve definitely done it,1
3281,I don’t really consider waterproof for most approach shoes I own~ if the weather turns then I’m outta there u less it’s a much longer in trip,1
3282,In such case I’m probably wearing a light boot anyway,1
3283,Water crossings~ barefoot,1
3284,The best show is usually the one that fits your foot the best,1
3285,Wide or narrow forefoot~ heel~ toe box~ etc,1
3286,try a bunch and buy the pair that fits your foot the best,1
3287,Done a bunch of E Sierra and W Sierra approaches in Guide Tennies,1
3288,I've had them for 3 years and just got them resoled a month ago~ pretty sure they'll last a while longer too,1
3289,Super comfy~ like foot pillows,1
3290,Only downside I'd say is that I think they're heavier than other approach shoes,1
3291,Hey everyone~ thanks for all the advice,1
3292,Lots to think about,1
3293,It'll be difficult to try them all on right now,1
3294,"I'm expecting to demolish the things over the summer~ so as long as they last that long I""ll be happy (and I may be taking off a month in September to dirt bag it~ we'll see)",1
3295,The XT3 and XT4 are the top contenders at the moment; a buddy of mine swore by his the other day,1
3296,What's up with the XT2s?,1
3297,I haven't been to the Eastern Sierra~ but after using La Sportiva TX3 very heavily for 3-4 months (mostly in Red Rocks and on nearby limestone)~ the sole is beginning to fall off and there's a couple small holes in the upper mesh,1
3298,Overall I love the TX3,1
3299,They're comfortable~ especially with the wide box toe~ and climb well on low class 5,1
3300,I'm somewhat disappointed that they're falling apart~ but I've put them through the ringer,1
3301,I should be able to get another few weeks out of them though,1
3302,I ordered a new pair of TX4~ so hoping those are more durable (no holes like in the TX3 mesh),1
3303,I suspect the Eastern Sierra has more rugged terrain than Red Rocks though..,1
3304,They're lighter~ more minimal~ less support~ little midsole cush~ more pliable/less wear resistant upper,1
3305,Great to pack with you on your harness for walk offs,1
3306,I wouldn't wanna do a thru hike in them,1
3307,If there's something you wanna actually climb that you want to have a bit more sensitivity~ or has a crack you wanna squirm your foot in~ they can be handy,1
3308,They excel at smearing and smedging,1
3309,Can't edge,1
3310,One of my favorite all-day climbing/scrambling shoes for the easy routes here in the Flatirons,1
3311,Feels like cheating when compared to other approach shoes,1
3312,Can be resoled.,1
3313,breathable shoes debate The only time I've found shoes w/Goretex worth it is when the temp is below 0 (so winter~ snow),1
3314,I've backpacked for weeks in Alaska  in summertime (read: a f'n swamp) in LS Mutants and I wouldn't want to have had a GTX shoe on me,1
3315,The shoe gets wet~ your feet get wet,1
3316,It's just what's inevitable,1
3317,If you submerge any shoe~ the interior is gunna get wet,1
3318,When that happens~ do you want waterproof or breathable when you want to get water OUT of the shoe?,1
3319,It might be worth looking at the TX Guides,1
3320,They've got a lug sole for hiking and sticky rubber in the front for climbing,1
3321,I've gone for runs up to 10 miles and climbed mid 10s in them,1
3322,So far they've been treating me well,1
3323,We'll see how they do after a couple of months in a mining camp,1
3324,They're not waterproof~ but they're more water resistant than the mesh shoes are.,1
3325,I dig the TX3~ they’re pretty durable as well as technical~ decent edging,1
3326,If you’re going for waterproof you’d probably need boots and/or gaiters but I really do a minimum of snow approaches,1
3327,From trail running~ I learned I’d rather have wet feet because running shoes really aren’t keeping out moisture with the low profile and you sweat anyway~ but I’m speaking more in terms of running in the rain which you probably wouldn’t be doing.,1
3328,I like the Garmont Dragontail MNT better than the TX4 and TX3 as they've got stiffer sole and more support~ especially on multiday outings,1
3329,The MNT are more comparable to the TX Guide,1
3330,TX3 are fine for trail dayhikes~ but not durable enough for my tastes off trail,1
3331,The Dragontail are available with or without Goretex~ and if you want a higher ankle cut they make the Vetta version.,1
3332,Well~ it looks like retail is opening up in Cali again~ so I may actually get a chance to try on some of these shoes soon,1
3333,TX3 seems like the popular choice (also my buddy's choice)~ but I have weird feet so I'm going to try on the other recs,1
3334,The Garmont is an interesting mix; it looks sturdy for sure,1
3335,Someone needs to come out with an approach shoe that can take a crampon,1
3336,That'd be sick,1
3337,EDIT: Apparently it can be done~ poorly.,1
3338,I'd have no concerns using the Dragontail MNT with full strap crampons~ they might even be OK with hybrid style bindings.,1
3339,I very much like the TX4 low and mid~ and appreciate the sacrifice in breathability for the more durable leather uppers~ especially since I do some scrambling in them,1
3340,I quit guide tennies cold turkey once I'd had a taste of the sportivas,1
3341,Side-note: I was surprised to learn that the TX4 fits differently than the TX2,1
3342,One thing I didn't see mentioned is that a high/mid top can help keep scree and sand out which translates to either more comfort or less stops to dump shoes,1
3343,I admittedly have never tried hiking gaiters,1
3344,I've worn crampons on the TX4 gtx mids and it wasn't terrible,1
3345,My main issue with 'pons and approach shoes on snow climbs is having snow accumulate between the shoe sole and 'pon~ slowly prying your toes up,1
3346,Not comfy,1
3347,"It seems unavoidable with such a soft soled ""boot"" but I'm open to hearing if others experience this as well",1
3348,We use Kathtoola hiking crampons on things like trail runners all the time,1
3349,Any easy snow climbs work well,1
3350,I sprung for some TX4s and I love them,1
3351,Strapped on some crampons and did a lot of snow in them this past weekend with good results,1
3352,I might get a mid version someday,1
3353,Merrell Moabs are killer for hiking~ shwacking~ and even slabs (vibram soles~ waterproof or mesh options),1
3354,I have had the 5.10 Guides and wasn't a huge fan,1
3355,I currently have the leather TX2s and they are AMAZING for climbing in~ although they aren't as burly as the guides,1
3356,I've lead up to 10c in them!,1
3357,For actual climbing use (op mentions class 4) I think the La Sportiva TX2/3/4 are kinda garbage,1
3358,The rubber (Vibram Megagrip) is not made for real climbing~ and isn't the same stuff they use on their climbing shoes,1
3359,Don't get me wrong I love my TX2s for long approaches~ just the rubber is not very sticky,1
3360,Even on a boulder hopping approach I'll feel them slip on stuff that my Guide Tennies won't,1
3361,Guide Tennies on the other hand use the same sticky rubber (Stealth C4) that's used in their climbing shoes,1
3362,Not as durable~ but climbs way better,1
3363,If I had to solo up some slab~ hands down I'm taking my Guide Tennies over my TX2s,1
3364,I'm not familiar with the other shoes mentioned in the thread~ but if they're not using the same rubber as a climbing shoe~ they're gonna be sub-par for climbing.,1
3365,There's many a flatiron slabmonger that would disagree with you,1
3366,"Coming from the Guide Tennies (the older~ ""good"" ones)~ moving to a pair of TX2's felt like cheating",1
3367,You wouldn't even want climbing rubber on an approach shoe - it would wear out too fast (so I wouldn't expect it),1
3368,What you're comparing is any other running or hiking shoe - compare Megagrip to any of the FriXion compounds: world's different,1
3369,With Megagrip~ you gain stickiness~ you lose durability,1
3370,Keep going to climbing shoe rubber~ and you lose even more durability~ as well as performance on wet surfaces,1
3371,Whatever the dot rubber that 5.10 uses on its approach shoe~ it's pretty similar to Megagrip,1
3372,(TX2 is just a better fitting shoe for me),1
3373," You've been had by marketing - it's ""Stealth"" (which is meaningless)~ but it's not C4.",1
3374,I disagree with this pretty hard,1
3375,I think my guide tennies are awful in comparison to my TX3s,1
3376,I have been able to comfortably climb 5.11/v3 in my TX3s and haven't had any issue with them slipping while smearing or scrambling easy 4th and 5th class,1
3377,The guide tennies have less support~ feel worse when hiking~ and have less sensitivity when climbing imo,1
3378,I honestly do not enjoy wearing my guide tennies at all,1
3379,Guide Tennies are great for Sierra granite~ but the soles delaminate quite fast~ especially if you are jamming them on cracks a lot,1
3380,Does anyone know why the high top version has been discontinued?,1
3381," You've been had by marketing - it's ""Stealth"" (which is meaningless)~ but it's not C4",1
3382,That link says C4 is used on Guide Tennies,1
3383,Uh oh!,1
3384,That link says C4 is used on Guide Tennies,1
3385,Uh oh! It's C4 fer sher,1
3386,"They have other ""Stealth"" rubbers (eg Stealth Onyxx) but they do use C4 in the Tennies",1
3387,Some argue that the Stealth recipes changed when Adidas bought them~ but that's a different topic,1
3388,The argument about durability is valid (Megagrip is going to last longer than C4) but there's a reason Megagrip isn't used in climbing shoes and C4 is,1
3389,One is objectively stickier,1
3390,The C4 rubber (and tennie sole design) is also not great in dirt~ so there's definitely a compromise being made for stickiness vs durability and 'all around' functionality.,1
3391,It doesn't pass a sniff test though,1
3392,The Megagrip on the TX is certainly not like any of the other Vibram climbing rubber,1
3393,I can certainly tell the difference climbing say: the First Flatiron in TX2's when compared to TC Pro's (shod with XS Edge),1
3394,The TC's feel way stickier,1
3395,Now think of what people resole TC's with - is it more XS Edge~ or do a large amount of people prefer C4? C4 has a rep,1
3396,of being stickier than at least XS Edge,1
3397,Now go back to comparing a 5.10 tennie to a TX3,1
3398,Feel pretty similar back on the First Flatiron,1
3399,You're saying the C4 I just resoled my TC Pro's with is the same C4 on the 5.10 Tennie? Okay,1
3400,I get it~ it's hard to prove~ since I currently can't get a sheet of Dot Rubber or C4 from 5.10 and compare using~ Science!  But the use case for an approach shoe and a climbing shoe is different - why would one ever use the same rubber? Better life/performance using a different rubber compound for each use case,1
3401,Any stories of getting an approach shoe resoled with C4 Stealth? (NOT Dot Rubber)? I would if they'd let me~ but my feeling is that it would be a lot more expensive,1
3402,If it's the same compound for the approach shoe rubber~ why is it cheaper to resole in comparison?,1
3403,Hard to believe~ I can tell,1
3404,You're paying the same price for TX3s and Tennies but one comes with a big slab of C4 climbing rubber?!?! Either there's a conspiracy and the manufacturer and all the testers are lying to you~ or...,1
3405,You're paying the same price for TX3s and Tennies but one comes with a big slab of C4 climbing rubber?!?!  Either there's a conspiracy and the manufacturer and all the testers are lying to you~ or..,1
3406,Weak-sauce Sportiva shoelaces aside~ I'm pretty happy with the durability of the TX2 - they're durable enough to take a resole after 2 years of use,1
3407,Are they the most durable approach shoe in the world? Not by a country mile,1
3408,But there's the TX3~ TX4~ etc that are much more durable if that's what you want,1
3409,I didn't have bad durability issues with the old 5.10 tennie~ but the TX2 just fits better for climbin'~ as it's a much more low profile~ sensitive shoe,1
3410,When I use to work at the Yosemite Mountaineering School~ it wasn’t uncommon to see other guides get approach shoes resoled with C4 climbing shoe rubber,1
3411,It was usually just the front 1/3 of the shoe,1
3412,Made sense for the use case there where it wasn’t uncommon to guide 5.9/5.10 terrain in approach shoes,1
3413,I never opted for C4 as the dot tread was plenty sticky enough for me,1
3414,Though honestly I only used a couple pairs of 5.10’s as they always fell apart on me so I switched to sportivas,1
3415,I did a lot of climbing in the old Exum Ridges,1
3416,Rubber was mediocre but good enough I could still do Serenity to Sons in them,1
3417,These days I have 4 different pairs in the TX line depending on the route,1
3418,Overall I haven’t been super impressed with the tx2 or tx3,1
3419,I’ve completely blown them apart in a few months,1
3420,The mesh just doesn’t seem to last for me,1
3421,I’ve had much better luck with the Tx4,1
3422,One of the best all around approach shoes I’ve ever used,1
3423,I’ve also spend a lot of time the Tx4 mids,1
3424,They aren’t amazing but pretty good when a higher top is required.,1
3425,The Sierra is full of talus crud chutes,1
3426,If you're like me~ you will value durability above all else,1
3427,For this reason~ I would like to take the opportunity to rag on the 5.10 guide tennies,1
3428,I've blown them apart in just a few trips before,1
3429,Yes they climb well~ but you can climb fun class 4 / easy 5th routes in just about anything,1
3430,"These days I'm rocking a PAIR OF BOOTS! The Sportiva ""TX5 GTX"" As Mikey and Long Ranger note~ the cool thing about Sportiva is there is a whole continuous spectrum of shoes available depending on how burly you need them to be",1
3431,You might be able to get a flexible strap-on crampon on the TX5s although I haven't tried it,1
3432,Generally if you put a crampon on an approach shoe you're gonna have a bad time.,1
3433,I ll settle your la sportiva debate once and for all (just kidd...) I m just back from 2 different easy sport  multipitches with a newbie~ 8 pitches each and max grad .10a and I was rocking (pun intended...) my scarpa Mescalito from the car to the car and it felt great like it always does when I use those  shoes,1
3434,Here~ done~ debate is over ;) ps: you do have to use you arms more...,1
3435,Any sasquatch's out there that can recommend approach shoes in size 14 (48 euro)?,1
3436,My go to shoe would have to be the 5.10 guide tennie,1
3437,It is the most comfortable shoe I have gotten for approaches~ and hiking,1
3438,I have abused it and find that it is good for about 100-150 miles of extreme use (I.E hiking the grand canyon~ class 4 approaches~ hiking across the Ut desert and on LLC approches~ ect.),1
3439,The biggest downside is that this shoe is not waterproof~ so if that isn't an issue for you then I would say 100% get this shoe,1
3440,I prefer crocs,1
3441,Cheap~  good enough~ and effective prophylaxis.,1
3442,The Tx4 would be my choice,1
3443,No reason to have waterproof approach shoes for Sierra summer activities,1
3444,As much as I loved 5.10 Guides for a long time the TX4 is an actual progression of the burlier side of approach shoes,1
3445,If you want to put strap crampons on them for snow field romping it'll definitely work,1
3446,The best strap crampons right now are the dynemma cable'd Petzl crampons for when you actually needs crampons (Camp also has similar dynemma linked ones),1
3447,Having that flexible underfoot connection makes them so much more secure underfoot and less sketchy feeling than rigid bar strap crampons,1
3448,My preference is the Irvis Hybrid so you still have the steel front and the lightweight-ness of the dynemma cable and alum rear,1
3449,And they also make awesome lightweight full auto crampons for ski mountaineering,1
3450,Been rocking the grocery outlet flip flops lately! They’re a dollar each and get me to the base of most routes no problem! Almost blew through my first pair after 7 months of approaches in them,1
3451,Already picked up a second pair though~ the price did increase~ they’re now $2 each foot,1
3452,Really like(d) the fit and feel of my TX3s~ but kinda unimpressed with the durability -- I've worn them for around eight months and there are holes in the mesh on both shoes and the tread/soles are almost totally destroyed,1
3453,I wouldn't say I've babied the shoes~ but I wouldn't say I've 100 percent put them through the wringer either ..,1
3454,Maybe that's all I can expect from a $130 retail shoe in 2020?,1
3455,You re pointing something real here,1
3456,Many people take approach shoes for a 15 mins walk on a good trail to the crag...,1
3457,I m afraid that s the price you have to pay for the lightweight version,1
3458,I m afraid that s the price you have to pay for a lightweight version,1
3459,If it's like the TX2 you end up with a hole in the mesh on the outside of your foot right around where the widest part of your foot is,1
3460,I've had luck extending the life of the shoe a lot with some superglue though~ it bonds the mesh back together and holds well,1
3461,I think my next pair of TX2s are going to get pre-emptive superglue both on the thin rubber at the toe~ and on the mesh on the sides where they wear out.,1
3462,I think my next pair of TX2s are going to get pre-emptive superglue both on the thin rubber at the toe~ and on the mesh on the sides where they wear out,1
3463,Consider the leather version,1
3464,And aquaseal in lieu of superglue,1
3465,You can also mix in some climbing rubber dust the local resoler will most likely be happy to give ya for things like patching up the rubber around the toes.,1
3466,After some time in the TX guides..,1
3467,go street size~ don’t size down,1
3468,They are super narrow~ and aren’t as comfortable as other La Sportivas that I’ve worn for long days on your feet,1
3469,I still love them for mud~ climbing~ and everything in between..,1
3470,but damn~ they’re narrow.,1
3471,Scarpa Geckos climb really well,1
3472,For multi day missions I reckon Kailash Lites would be awesome for the Sierra,1
3473,Highly breathable and supportive.,1
3474,Looking for an honest opinion from those smarter and better then me at this,1
3475,I have been out of climbing for a couple of years due to my job but soon will be able to start again,1
3476,Almost all of my nylon/non-metal gear has aged out and I have replaced it as one should,1
3477,My question is this: I have a 9 year old rope that I have replaced (as my primary climbing rope),1
3478,This older rope has some signs of usage but no major damage (no flattening~ cuts~ excessive fuzz~ major discoloration ect...),1
3479,It has been stored in a rope bag and although moved around a lot~ kept in a dry container,1
3480,What are everyone's thoughts on using this rope as the other rope in a double rope rappel? The person who taught me how to climb thinks it's not a problem since it won't really be dynamically loaded and shows no damage,1
3481,In a ideal world I would just buy another $220 rope but these things aren't cheap,1
3482,Thanks for your insight.,1
3483,Your fine~ use it,1
3484,I’d lead on it from your description,1
3485,Check out @hownottohighline on YouTube   He does some load tests with older ropes that’ll inspire some confidence in your gear,1
3486,Totally fine.,1
3487,You have to make your own judgment about whether any particular rope is safe to lead on,1
3488,However~ something to consider about bringing a rope you wouldn't lead on is that you are giving up some of the advantage of having two ropes (i.e,1
3489,having a backup in case of rock-fall~ rope-stuck~ swinging leads in a party of three~ etc),1
3490,Another thing to consider is if you wouldn't lead on it~ maybe you shouldn't rescue with it either (i.e,1
3491,haul a human using mechanical advantage)~ or loan it out to someone who might lead on it,1
3492,None of those things are disqualifying~ just worthy (IMO) of consideration,1
3493,"  I think they are probably immaterial in a single-pitch TR situation~ which is why I think of my ropes as ""fine"" or ""TR only"" but I don't keep any in the category of ""rap only"" (other than special-purpose rap cords~ which are obviously a different thing...).",1
3494,Just as a reference point:  had a 20 yr old rope (11mm Mammut) that had been used hard and beat to shit~ held lead falls~ etc,1
3495,retired it and used it for lead fall tests (lost track of how many),1
3496,then roofing and general purpose rope use~ stored carelessly (sometimes on garage floor) then at 25 yrs old re-tested with 5x FF1 lead falls...all held,1
3497,I finally said “Fuck it~ this rope won’t die” and went back to leading on it again,1
3498,(J/k),1
3499,No problem....it is only a gravity load,1
3500,There likely will be people climbing next to you on older ropes,1
3501,Not that they should~ but they do as no one keeps their rope log up to date,1
3502,Rap on brother!,1
3503,Was using a 20 year old rope just a few days ago for some toproping on the seaside cliffs,1
3504,The time to retire the cord maybe when you have problems rapelling because the sheath and core move at a different rate which causes the sheath to bunch up around the core(which was happening),1
3505,I'd still whip all over that rope though~ it just made rappelling a bit sketchy.,1
3506,I will keep using an aged but good condition rope until it gets in my head,1
3507,As soon as I realize I’m “thinking about” wether the rope is solid~ I weave it into a floor mat,1
3508,You are probably good to go with your description,1
3509,Body weight only loads~ even with bouncing around~ are pretty low,1
3510,It's fine,1
3511,You also don't need to pay $220 for a decent rope.,1
3512,If you have any doubts at all you should..,1
3513,...not really~ it's fine.,1
3514,I side with this guy.youtube.com/watch?v=SqUSEXe…;list=PLne435yhSICcA3-wGJ5Arx5furwMUUT89&index=5,1
3515,I wouldn’t want to rap “off” a new rope OR an old rope,1
3516,Tie knots in the end if you have any doubts,1
3517,(Sorry~ couldn’t resist..,1
3518,the unrealized and demented English major in me.),1
3519,On a serious note~ the video that Brandon linked just above was quite interesting and worth a view (9 minutes long or so),1
3520,The guy is doing some pretty clever things in his garage,1
3521,One thing that wasn’t completely clear~ though~ was what his conclusions were about top roping,1
3522,Can someone clarify? Also~ if Rgold and/or Jim Titt (et al~ with testing experience) could weigh in on this guy‘s methodology and conclusions~ that would be a bonus,1
3523,At 6’8” and 225 lbs~ you may be putting more stress on a rope than the average climber~ but I’m confident that rope will still be fine!,1
3524,He has another video with more information:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=975rkB2JDz8,1
3525,Old ropes~ just like old Soldiers~ never die...,1
3526,they do get turned into rugs,1
3527," Old Army ""greenline""",1
3528,Thanks~ Brandon,1
3529,OK~ I see now that~ in his worst case scenario~ he is talking about what he calls “permanent top ropes” like what you might find hanging in a gym,1
3530,I did notice~ though~ that the machine he built to simulate cycling a top rope through an anchor carabiner only used a very short section of rope (maybe one meter?) and was constantly weighted to 80kg,1
3531,I’m thinking this kind of abuse would not be so narrowly focused in real life—that is~ it would be spread throughout much of the rope length,1
3532,Still~ his surprising results are worth some consideration..,1
3533,I’ll probably retire my very well-used gym rope just in case,1
3534,Another interesting point: the huge difference (to the better) with what I think is unicore technology in the durability of the rope in these kinds of “permanent top rope” scenarios,1
3535,Maybe it’s thread drift~ but I’d love to hear what other experienced testers think.,1
3536,You have come to the wrong place~ my friend.,1
3537,I've seen tests of old nylon,1
3538,It's still very strong,1
3539,I'm not concerned at all about rapping on a 9 year old rope (if stored properly),1
3540,I also use 9 year old ropes for top roping,1
3541,Lead climbing is different because it's not just strength~ it's elasticity you want to safely catch a lead fall,1
3542,Elasticity lessens over time~ so I wouldn't lead on 9 year old rope normally~ but in an emergency (main lead line got chopped) I'd do it if needed,1
3543," Old Army ""greenline"" haven’t had the heart to take mine “out of service” so to speak",1
3544,Ready to answer that call for tactical climbs,1
3545,BD did some drop (dynamic load) tests on decades old rope and said that the old rope was indistinguishable from new.,1
3546,He has another video with more information:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=975rkB2JDz8 Wow that was pretty damn interesting,1
3547,I am amazed that the unicore rope (might be a Beal Top Gun?) was that much more durable than the others!,1
3548,A lead rope isn't worn out when it might break~ it's worn out when it's stiff~ won't absorb impact,1
3549,An undamaged rope is toast for leading long before it will break under factor two falls,1
3550,But if you take a factor two fall on a rope which is on its way to becoming static? I took a lead fall on a vertical route in Josh - a bit longish but protected by a bolt - climbing on a perfectly good looking~ but played out rope,1
3551,The sprained back took me out of the game for three months,1
3552,That was no where near factor two~ I was fifty feet above my belayer and fell about 15.,1
3553,BD did some drop (dynamic load) tests on decades old rope and said that the old rope was indistinguishable from new,1
3554,Its been tested from here to the south pole,1
3555,Its all good man! It might suck for belaying and rappelling but I trust it,1
3556,Mostly.,1
3557,Agree 100%~ good point to emphasize,1
3558,I was more focused on his concern for rappelling.,1
3559,My 2 year old grigri+ has malfunctioned a couple of times in the past months,1
3560,When rappelling with it~ it feels as if the anti-panic function is engaged and I have to pull the lever back all the way to lower,1
3561,I can't un-engage the anti-panic function,1
3562,This first happened a couple of months ago~ and after taking the grigri off of the rope~ opening and inspecting it~ then reinstalling it onto the rope~ it worked fine,1
3563,It happened again yesterday and I've been unable to get it to work properly since,1
3564,Already contacted Petzl and waiting for a reply,1
3565,Anyone else experienced something similar?,1
3566,Just gonna throw it out there~ what diameter rope are you using?,1
3567,>I've been unable to get it to work properly since Can you grab a picture of the inside of the handle~ if it's still funky?,1
3568,I have always ended up griping and groaning when a GriGri+ floats its way into my hands,1
3569,I use the New grigri or a grigri2 normally and the mechanics of them seem to be much more simplistic~ and I've never had an issue with those models,1
3570,Gris suck,1
3571,Get used to it.,1
3572,Sounds like the metal piece the lever engages against isn't springing back when you let the lever down all the way to me,1
3573,Maybe it's full of dirt and needs a cleaning? Edit: Haven't had mine totally lock up~ but seeing how it works that's my hunch if it's stuck in anti-panic mode,1
3574,Mine has worked flawlessly for the 1+ year I've had it so far.,1

3576,What's everyone go-to for an all around flatiron climbing/scrambling shoe? Something that's great for the approach~ climb and descent,1
3577,I've been rocking the TX Guides which are great~ but was wondering what everyone else is using.,1
3578,Salewa Firetail 3,1
3579,I've been through a lot of different approach shoes and these have held up longer than anything else and can climb really well,1
3580,You'll find a spectrum of what people like to use,1
3581,I personally usually use a pair of trail runners~ and a pair of tightly fitting approach shoes - I like the trailrunners because I do a lot of running before/after; a like the fit of the approach shoes for better performance,1
3582,I'm not sure if there's One True Shoe~ really - just compromises,1
3583,If you get minimal with the approach shoe~ the rest of the hike won't be as comfortable,1
3584,Just got the Sportiva TC Guides and have really liked them for both the run and the scramble (as opposed to the other TX models~ which miss the mark),1
3585,They're head-and-shoulders better than the (embarrassingly high number) of other approach/scrambling shoes I have,1
3586,Most of the serious folks I know resole slightly tight running shoes with sticky rubber,1
3587,5.10~ Scarpa~ and now BD also make approach shoes (maybe Adidas too?)--get ones with the most amount of forefoot and heel padding for running the approach/descent,1
3588,Saucony running shoes?,1
3589,Only if attempting onsight 5.13 free solo,1
3590,I like the 5.10 Guide tennie~ it has super sticky  stealth rubber which is really nice on the slabby approaches~ and I have put them through the ringer in every type of environment from hiking rim to rim grand canyon to rain forests in New Zealand,1
3591,They tend to last me for about 100-120 miles per pair before needing to be replaced and they are a little cheaper (like $90-100 if I remember right) than some other approach shoes,1
3592,The biggest down side is they aren't super water proof - or water proof like at all,1
3593,Something I like about the black diamonds (and to some extent mastercams) is the ability to manipulate individual lobes with a nut tool to get a stuck piece out,1
3594,This has led to some pretty good booty so far,1
3595,I'm thinking about replacing my trusty blue #1 mastercams with the black totem~ particularly since I've enjoyed the single set of larger sizes,1
3596,I did run into a nearly new black totem that was stuck in a crack~ and I even went back to spend a second 20 minutes on it the next morning,1
3597,I had zero luck getting any of the lobes to move and it seemed part of it was having zero space to move the lobes~ since the totem heads are a mess of thick wires,1
3598,1) Does anyone have any tips for getting a stuck totem out? (The one I was talking about was 2 years ago~ so I doubt it's still there.) 2) Does anyone find that the black totem is more prone to getting stuck? (Yes I know~ place better gear,1
3599,But sometimes it happens and maybe my follower is not as skilled at retrieval.),1
3600,I havn't had issues~ but it's likely because you learn to place totems differently than SLCDs~ you shouldnt be overcamming them to the point where you would be with other cams.,1
3601,I find they get stuck less,1
3602,Where is this black totem? Asking for a friend,1
3603,I feel like the UL Mastercams are easier to get stuck than the black totem~ myself,1
3604,At full retraction~ I think the Totem lobes are narrower than the bar thing behind them even.,1
3605,I place black and blue totems all the time and have never had one stuck,1
3606,Can't say that about small sized BD cams for sure,1
3607,Totems feel like they bite the rock better and it,1
3608,an be a little harder to manipulate them because of a lack of rigid stem (the lack of which is their biggest strength) but the biggest contributor to totems getting stuck is likely to be inexperience with them,1
3609,The shape of totem lobes is different than other cams and consequently what the lobes look like when completely cammed looks different than other cams,1
3610,If you try to place totems where the lobes visually look like other cams you are more likely to get them stuck,1
3611,Picture below shows side by side comparison between a fully cammed totem and a fully cammed C4 (larger size used for visual but applies to all sizes),1
3612,I think there's something to Ryan's theory -- the squared off lobes hit more crystals/deformations in some circumstances~ and the flex in the stem makes them a little harder to micro wiggle,1
3613,As others have said~ Totems are usually easier to get out but when they're stuck they tend to be really really stuck,1
3614,I think part of this is due to how easy it is to fully retract the cam lobes - this is a good thing and usually makes them easier to get out~ but when they're super stuck you don't have an extra couple mm to work with / force via a nut tool,1
3615,I've bootied a couple of smaller totems now including a yellow that was surprisingly hard to remove from what looked like a straightforward jammed placement (I don't think a bd would have gotten stuck in the same way)~ plus I've failed on a green that just wouldn't budge.,1
3616,Did you try on that green one stuck on leanie meanie? Someone got it out!,1
3617,For that yellow totem~ were 1 or more cam lobes still able to wiggle with either trigger or nut tool?,1
3618,Did you try on that green one stuck on leanie meanie? Someone got it out! Yep!,1
3619,I got a black totem stuck on Mordor Wall on Cathedral Ledge in NH,1
3620,Was aid soloing and couldn’t get it to budge cleaning the first pitch,1
3621,It was on a small traverse and the angle was wrong to back clean it well,1
3622,I was rushing because I had to make it home to pick up my kids three hours away! Best part was a woman I had messaged a little with here about aid climbing up there got it out after I told her I had fixed it and she mailed it back,1
3623,She only allowed me to pay the $7.95 shipping,1
3624,Pretty awesome,1
3625,Good morning I am a fairly new sport climber with a question about belaying from the top,1
3626,There are a few wonderful routes at the Obed in TN that have a wonderful view at the top and a really nice ledge to stand on while cleaning and such,1
3627,I am wanting to start learning multi pitch SPORT climbing by working on bringing up a second on a single pitch,1
3628,Not ready for trad yet,1
3629,Belaying from the top seems pretty intuitive but I want to be damn sure I am ready for all the strange occurrences that can happen,1
3630,Building anchors are so very case dependent~ and I don’t really want to discuss them hear (but the quad anchor is what I will most likely build),1
3631,QUESTION: lowering a climbing from above,1
3632,I have seen many different and fairly complicated methods,1
3633,The DMM pivot seems to make things very streamlined,1
3634,Is this really as simple and SAFE as it seems?https://vimeo.com/101652072 ​Thanks!!,1
3635,If your goal is to practice for multipitch~ I’d recommend rappelling the route instead of lowering the second,1
3636,Lowering another climber is something I almost never do on multipitch routes but transitioning from your anchor to a rappel is pretty common.,1
3637," I'd be hesitant to use guide mode when belaying from above on a typical Obed roof (as a ""fairly new sport climber"")",1
3638,What's your plan if your 2nd falls in the roof?,1
3639,That is the whole point of my question,1
3640,It looks like the DMM pivot makes lowering pretty simple,1
3641,It does not appear that I need to rig up slings to flip the ATC,1
3642,I would still think a prusik on my end would be needed however,1
3643,Good point,1
3644,I am very comfortable with that (I was an arborist for 9 years~ self belaying and rigging was done on the daily).,1
3645,Yeah~ it would definitely be better than a lot of comparable devices,1
3646,I'd still be hesitant (depending on the route) as it's an extra complication and sometimes communication can be tricky around a roof or bulge.,1
3647,I have considered that for sure,1
3648,I could then use a grigri,1
3649,My concern with that was:,1
3650,The biggest factors for me in deciding how I am going to belay from the top are # 1,1
3651,partners competence and secondly but still very important~ anchor location in relation to belay stance,1
3652,Super helpful to situate the master point above you when belaying in guide mode and always important to reduce friction as much as you can in guide mode,1
3653,Taking up slack can be a bit nuanced when in guide mode~ I like to have a hand occasionally  on the climbers strand to monitor the slack situation.Overhangs and belays back from the edge are good candidates for not using guide mode in most cases.,1
3654,I use a grigri to belay from the top 99% of the time for both sport and trad multipitch,1
3655,It’s SO simple and worth the money,1
3656,Slap it onto your anchor and pull the rope,1
3657,Lowering is easy as well as you redirect the brake-strand rope and  pull the lever,1
3658,Otherwise~ I belay with an ATC from my harness and redirect the rope,1
3659,However~ if you’re getting into multipitch~ I would bring your second up then rappel down rather than lowering,1
3660,It’s also nice to just get your second up and sit on the cliffside together,1
3661,That’s the best part of climbing taller stuff.,1
3662,You might want to edit your comment to mention that you need to redirect the brake strand before lowering,1
3663,You don’t *just* pull the lever,1
3664,Put your gri gri on the anchor to belay,1
3665,Be aware that the camming action could be compromised if the device gets jammed against the rock by the weight of a climber on the rope,1
3666,If you need to lower~ it is much easier,1
3667,I'd still recommend a friction knot on the brake side of the rope just in case~ or a big stopper knot tied in the brake side a few feet away.,1
3668,Thanks!!,1
3669,Yikes~ thank you !!,1
3670,I have considered that for sure,1
3671,My concern with that was: 1,1
3672,not an issue~ not enough force to be worried about,1
3673,Thanks!! I’ve never had a problem with this,1
3674,Make sure the masterpoint of the anchor is far enough away from the wall so that it doesn’t have the opportunity to jam,1
3675,Go indirect (with a clove hitch in the rope)~ and kind of weight the anchor so it gets pulled away from the wall if you can,1
3676,My concern with that was: Clip the gri-gri to the anchor~ don't fuss around with a re-direct,1
3677,Test the action on the cam to make sure there are no obstacles trapping it shut,1
3678,Now you're good to go.,1
3679,My concern with that was: If it's a modern bolted anchor I wouldn't consider 1 to be a serious concern (really I wouldn't stress about it on almost any anchor except for some kind of sketchy tied off rhodo nest),1
3680,And personally I don't stress about 2,1
3681,that much,1
3682,Plus~ as it's a single pitch climb you are talking about~ you can just lower off the second and consider the belay effectively escaped,1
3683,For 3~ I wouldn't worry too much either unless the difference is really dramatic,1
3684,Especially if a roof is in play~ the friction on the rope is going to add a lot of resistance,1
3685,But if it is a concern~ you can just hang the GriGri on the anchor directly~ as others have alluded to (I don't use a GriGri often so I won't presume to speak to nuances with that method).,1
3686,Said it once here on MP~ and I’ll say it again,1
3687,OP I think attempting to follow the information from an online forum is an accident waiting to happen,1
3688,I’d consider hiring a guide so you know you can do it correctly,1
3689,It’s not worth hurting yourself or your partner,1
3690,You might learn some other awesome skills in the process,1
3691,Stay Safe,1
3692,Best~ - R,1
3693,Thanks everyone!!,1
3694,100%! I like to learn as much as I can before I hire a guide so that I can ask relevant questions and get the most out of the time together,1
3695,I concur~ but you don't need a guide~ you just need someone who can show you in person.,1
3696,If you can position yourself such that the anchor bolts are even slightly above you~ you can build an identical configuration to a toprope,1
3697,That will be the most familiar and safest way to belay and lower a second from the top.,1
3698,If you are belaying directly off the anchor with a grigri~ or Atc type in guide mode~ you do not need to be able to escape the belay~ because you are not directly attached to it.,1
3699,You're not going to be belaying from the top on any of the Obed roof climbs,1
3700,Probably more likely best seat~ spawn~ or something similar,1
3701,I'd use a grigri off the anchor to belay that way,1
3702,Just do a weighted LSD lower~ I’ll find you a video,1
3703,OP here: Spawn is exactly the route I had I mind,1
3704,Did you helped to check the link to the DMM pivot that I attached in my original question?,1
3705,Right~ my original question was about lowering a climber should something happen,1
3706," Lowering a climber from above with a plaquette-style device in plaquette mode (aka ""something like the Pivot"") is always a horror show~ and these devices have well-documented catastrophic failure criteria that are difficult to understand and conceptualize",1
3707,"Read this as: ""There's a good chance you'll do something minor that immediately turns the device into a pulley and kills your friend."" While it can certainly be done somewhat safely by a person with training~ know-how~ practice~ and a prusik backup~ the majority of folks just avoid it in favor of other techniques --- especially because even when you do it ""safely~"" it doesn't end up being particularly smooth at all",1
3708,I exclusively use a redirected GRIGRI for this application: petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Lower…  Again~ it can be done,1
3709,But since you asked...don't do it,1
3710," Lowering a climber with a grigri in ""guide mode"" is exactly the same as lowering a climber with a grigri not in guide mode",1
3711,Alternatively~ you belay off your harness with a redirect through the anchor~ and save yourself the trouble of it all,1
3712,In thousands of climbs I've lowered a climber to rework a move~ or get to a good starting point after a fall~ many times,1
3713,I've never needed to lower a climber to the bottom of a pitch and never needed to escape the belay,1
3714,Although it's good to have a plan in mind if things go wrong~ you should setup your system towards the most likely scenarios,1
3715,Guide mode is an advanced use of the device,1
3716,IMO you should learn and master the normal way to belay from your waist with a redirect before considering guide mode,1
3717,Lowering in guide mode is more complex and risky,1
3718,If you feel you must use guide mode~ as mentioned use a grigri,1
3719,Almost doubling to force on an anchor for top roping (basically what's happening with a redirect to the second) is not a problem,1
3720,When you lead you if you take a lead fall you could take a high fall factor fall onto a single piece with the almost doubling~ and it's within the limits of the system,1
3721,For a correctly built multipiece anchor with top rope falls~ it's a non issue,1
3722,Escaping the belay is extremely rare,1
3723,In most cases as a beginner you are better off calling for a rescue and letting the professionals help~ instead of trying to escape the belay and making things worse,1
3724,As mentioned just lower your partner to the ground,1
3725,If your partner is heavier than you place a piece by your feet~ with a tether to your belay loop~ that holds you down,1
3726,You will need to learn this skill for belaying a leader that's heavier than you anyway,1
3727,Learn and practice the basics before moving on to more advanced techniques.,1
3728,No it's not~ don't spread this dangerous misinformation,1
3729,The friction over the lip~ which is hard to maintain with the device pointing down~ is a key part of the GriGri's function,1
3730,To get this back~ you need a redirect~ see here or here,1
3731,Note how in the second video she's using a carabiner made by Petzl specifically for this purpose,1
3732,You don't need that carabiner but it's strongly recommended that you use a redirect~ and it's mandatory if you're any sort of guide.,1
3733,No it's not~ don't spread this dangerous misinformation,1
3734,You don't need that carabiner but it's strongly recommended that you use a redirect~ and it's mandatory if you're any sort of guide,1
3735,TRUE,1
3736,You have much less friction lowering from the top (for a direct belay) than you do lowering from the ground,1
3737,Redirect is safer and gives better control.,1
3738,Banshee with a Munter hitch.,1
3739,Here's a video on belaying from the top with a Grigri:youtube.com/watch?v=F_f61vU…  As mentioned earlier in this thread~ you don't need a fancy and expensive Freino biner,1
3740,Any properly sized and positioned re-direct is sufficient,1
3741,I promise that once you go to Grigri for top belay and multi-pitch~ you'll never go back,1
3742,It gives so much less friction compared to a plate device in guide mode~ which means it's waaay less tiring to pull in rope,1
3743,In terms of pure energy expenditure~ the efficiency gained here totally offsets the weight of the device,1
3744,And that's before even considering the functional benefits of lowering a follower~ setting up a haul~ belaying a leader with assisted braking~ etc,1
3745,I used to think the Grigri was only for single pitch sport climbing~ but now I've seen the light and I'm a believer,1
3746,Mule hitch added to Munter for hands free~ (escape~ lunch etc) Autoblock for backup on lowering with Munter.youtube.com/watch?v=FMtt0K4…,1
3747,In a scenario with multipitch routes over big roofs~ especially if there is any traversing angle to the route~ a very useful thing is for the second to have a microascender or prussik and know how to ascend the rope,1
3748,You can't alway guarantee that a lower will bring your second back to the lower belay station~ esp since they have removed gear between the lower anchor and themselves,1
3749,They could end up in space or having to pendulum sideways to reach the anchor again,1
3750,"  If you are lowering them to the the ground~ yes~ you can usually lower them to the ground~ but even this is not always guaranteed~ routes that start on ledges with ground falling away from one side or the other is one scenario where a lower to the ""ground"" can still end with the second in a dicey situation.",1
3751,The friction over the lip~ which is hard to maintain with the device pointing down~ is a key part of the GriGri's function,1
3752,It's not a key part of the GriGri's function,1
3753,Obviously you should try to have the friction over the lip while using it~ but it works just fine without it,1
3754,It's more tricky to control the lower~ certainly~ but the cam still engages just fine even on thin ropes,1
3755,Either way~ you're not wrong~ it's best to redirect the brake strand over the lip,1
3756,It's not a key part of the GriGri's function,1
3757,The manufacturer's instructions say that a redirect should be used when lowering.,1
3758,OP here~ this looks like the ticket for sure! It just seems so simple that I got a bit concerned..,1
3759,I want to be sure that I have all my bases covered before I try anything like this,1
3760,For sure it would be on a route both of us know well,1
3761,I,1
3762,I Do you know Audie of the ETCC? He's always out and about in the Obed and loves teaching/helping people including new climbers,1
3763,Shoot him a message and he might be down to meet up,1
3764,For anyone who feels the need to post basic belaying/rappelling/protection placing questions~ where the answers could put someone's life at risk~ the easy answer is hire a certified guide,1
3765,Mountain Project comments can be helpful or less than helpful.The problem is that Newbie OPs are rarely in a position to know the difference.,1
3766,Send me a message,1
3767,I could get out and show you the ropes as they say,1
3768,I live in the region and could use an excuse to get outside,1
3769,I concur~ but you don't need a guide~ you just need someone who can show you in person,1
3770,That's true~ but when you're new~ it can be hard to discern the knowledgeable from those talking out of their asses,1
3771,I'm sure many of us here have seen someone acting and sounding like an expert when he doesn't actually know jack shit,1
3772,For a newbie wanted to learn a specific skill~ I think a guide is best if it's in the budget,1
3773,Any legit guide has some certifications showing he knows (or should know) what he's doing.,1
3774,OP~ I typically belay from above with an ATC in guide mode only if there are two followers or I'm pretty damn sure my follower won't need to be lowered,1
3775,In the latter case~ I still prefer a Grigri or other ABD like a Lifeguard or a Birdie,1
3776,On multi-pitch~ I almost always carry both an ATC and a Grigri,1
3777,The extra weight and space are really not big deals,1
3778,The more you use a Grigri~ the more you learn what a valuable and versatile tool it is.,1
3779,Do you know Audie of the ETCC? He's always out and about in the Obed and loves teaching/helping people including new climbers,1
3780,I don’t,1
3781,But I will find him and reach out,1
3782,I tie off with a clove hitch and a locking biner a few feet (at least an arm and a half if the climb allows) below the anchor~ and then redirect the rope from the anchor and belay them just like I would do a normal top rope belay from the bottom,1
3783,My climbing partner is significantly heavier than me~ and I have never had a problem when he falls with getting sucked into the redirect.,1
3784,The number of people that use a redirect off the anchor for a second is somewhat shocking to me and reflects the lack of experience of the posters~ imo,1
3785,This guarantees that the belayer will be pulled off their stance if a heavier climber falls below them crashing them into the anchor and potentially compromising the belay,1
3786,Doubt this? Have someone surprise place 200# in your hands and see how it turns out,1
3787,The way to bring up the second is either with the device on the anchor itself (GriGri or Guide Mode) or~ if using a GG or standard tube then belay off of the rope loop formed by your harness tie in and let the anchor take all the weight this way,1
3788,Adjust length via cloves to let you sit comfortably at the lip to maintain vision and communication with the second and let the anchor take the weight if they fall,1
3789,You are also in perfect position to lower them if you choose to get them back on the ground quickly and safely,1
3790,This can be much easier than rigging a rappel keeping things nice and clean rather than having two at the belay needing to use some form of PAS to untie from the rope at what can be an awkward and crowded belay,1
3791,Much easier for one to do it with his partner already out of the way,1
3792,Unbelievable that so many don't know this Climbing 101 yet post like they have experience using a redirect when they really don't seem to know the consequences.,1
3793,good stance tight rope from harness to anchor running in direction of pull of climber rope running thru biner clipped to the loop formed by the tie in figure 8 knot on guide hand side gloves good communication using both verbal and rope signals hip belay,1
3794,Aaand now we've covered every possibility,1
3795,Time to lock the thread.,1
3796,To answer your question~ yes,1
3797,The DMM pivot is very simple to use for lowering your second,1
3798,Locker where have you been?  I missed you!,1
3799,Hi there! I have been using the Petzl Dual Connect Adjust for a bit now and i find it quite bulky especially cause of the fixed arm,1
3800,I am thinking to cut off the fixed arm and i was wondering if that would compromise somehow the safety? Thank you in advance!,1
3801,Get a sling of the correct length~ put two overhand knots in it~ one at the end and one at 1/3rd-ish of the length~ sell the Dual Adjust~ problem solved,1
3802,In general I don't think it is recommendable to put a scissor in a life-line~ no matter how it is constructed.,1
3803,You should sell that one and just buy the Adjust~ the one with just a single adjustable arm.,1
3804,I cut off the fixed arm~ and I am much happier with it,1
3805,I just use the adjustable arm as PAS and a separate sling/draw for extending my rappel device,1
3806,I cannot imagine there being a safety issue~ as long as you properly seal the cut end to keep it from fraying,1
3807,I was thinking the same about that,1
3808,But might try to sell it and buy the one without the fixed arm~ if not i will most likely cut it.,1
3809,You can also build a Percell Prusik that will give you the same functionality for about $2 worth of 6mm cord.,1
3810,After using the single adjust for a while~ then being disappointed with the dual connect adjust's stumpy fixed arm~ I cannibalized the adjusty parts of both~ added a length of retired rope~ and now have a two-armed frankenAdjust~ where both sides are the same as the good side of the dual,1
3811,Highly recommended - being able to go into both bolts and adjust both arms are great features to have.,1
3812,Can you post a pic ?,1
3813,Petzl sold this configuration for a bit~ i believe it was called the Aid Adjust,1
3814,It used a piece of 8mm dynamic instead of the 9mm like the normal one.,1
3815,Mikey~ that sounds like Evolv Adjust which is still available as far as I can tell?,1
3816,Thanks for the correction,1
3817,I'd searched for it a while back on Petzl's site and couldn't find it.,1
3818,is that something you'd actually be concerned about?,1
3819,I would have few reservations with using the evolv adjust as a personal lanyard~ despite Petzl’s warnings.The 15 kN static strength requirement for personal lanyards seems overly conservative to me for a dynamic rope,1
3820,Petzl apparently measured a maximum force of 6.2 kN in a factor 2 fall on the evolv adjust,1
3821,Perhaps someone with more knowledge than me can explain the rationale for the 15 kN static load requirement.https://m.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/CONNECT-ADJUST-strength-and-certification?ProductName=CONNECT-ADJUSThttps://m.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Risks-related-to-replacing-the-rope-in-the-L35-adjustable-lanyards?ProductName=CONNECT-ADJUSThttps://m.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/EVOLV-ADJUST-strength?ProductName=EVOLV-ADJUST,1
3822,That is super cool - i use the single one and have the double just sitting in the closet,1
3823,May have to try to this out~ although it does seem like it would be quite bulky,1
3824,I'd searched for it a while back on Petzl's site and couldn't find it,1
3825,It definitely won't give you the same functionality,1
3826,The connect-adjust is much smoother and quicker to adjust,1
3827,I'll let you be the judge of whether that's worth the extra ~$45~ but let's not pretend you're getting nothing for the extra money.,1
3828,I'll let you be the judge of whether that's worth the extra ~$45~ but let's not pretend you're getting nothing for the extra money,1
3829,To me~ no~ it's not worth it~ but I don't use a special PAS at all~ including the percell,1
3830,Just throwing it out there as an adjustable PAS option that some of my friends use.,1
3831," is that something you'd actually be concerned about? The instructions include: ""The EVOLV ADJUST is not personal protective equipment.""~ so I am concerned about it~ yes",1
3832,I know enough about engineering to know that I don't know enough about that type of engineering~ and I'll listen to the engineers that do,1
3833,If it was totally safe~ they'd make more money marketing it that way~ so there's something there that they know that I don't.,1
3834,Yeah~ it's definitely present on the harness~ but I don't find that it gets in the way too much~ with the exception of the dangling loop occasionally getting snagged if I have it too long (there's probably some optimization to be done in the arm lengths~ too),1
3835,If you're cool with one bolt~ then it's a moot point - use the single Connect Adjust,1
3836,I was finding myself wearing the CA and a chain-style one because I'm not comfortable with one bolt~ so this is less bulky by comparison for me.,1
3837,I was finding myself wearing the CA and a chain-style one because I'm not comfortable with one bolt~ so this is less bulky by comparison for me,1
3838,"With the chain style PAS~ I think it's ""standard"" to just clip a draw through one of the PAS loops and into the other bolt",1
3839,To the other person (Ramacam Stopper): only using one bolt is a bad idea..,1
3840,don't do it,1
3841,If you're up there cleaning on a sport climb with only the connect adjust clip it into the two draws (or masterpoint~ or whatever) that are hanging off the bolts~ not one of the bolts themselves,1
3842,Or have a sling~ rope~ or some backup system connected to the other bolt.,1
3843," With the chain style PAS~ I think it's ""standard"" to just clip a draw through one of the PAS loops and into the other bolt",1
3844,Definitely - that's how I originally did it~ but then wanted the easy slide ability of the connect to weight the new system~ but that left me only on one bolt~ unless I used another PAS (which I'm then only using for one bolt~ instead of the normal two that it can do),1
3845,A frustrating circle of not-quite-enough solutions~ but now I'm happy with the double-armed connect hybrid :),1
3846,Aside from the “just clove hitch the rope” comment~ look into the Kong slyde,1
3847,It’s $10 and seems like to would work for what you are looking for,1
3848,I burnt a small hole after the stopper knot and added a keychain ring,1
3849,I can the clip the ring into the locker and it keeps the tail out of the way,1
3850,OR you could buy a metolius pas which is lighter and can be clipped shorter,1
3851,What benefit are you getting from the Petzl product that you wouldn’t get from these cheaper and less bulky alternatives?,1
3852,Another option with the single leg connect adjust is to replace the rope with a slightly longer (and skinnier depending on usage) rope and then when two clip in points are needed just clove hitch a draw into the tail and clip in with that as well,1
3853,This is the system i've been running for a couple years now,1
3854,I replaced the rope with a piece of 8mm dynamic which obviously makes the the system a bit weaker but also a lot less bulky,1
3855,I find the trade off worth it but like all lighter and weaker gear a bit more attention needs to be paid so might not be a good fit for others,1
3856,Isn't that a special PAS? It's just that you made it,1
3857,I've made one too~ and the purcell is much more difficult to adjust and has a much smaller range than the Petzl stuff,1
3858,I find that it saves a lot of time getting onto rappel and lowering~ because of the easy motion and the ability to run it all the way out to get weight on the new system,1
3859,Everybody is free to value different characteristics differently~ but if you made and carry a purcell~ you definitely have a PAS~ right? Reread my comment,1
3860,I don't use a PAS~ including the Percell,1
3861,They are a waste of time for general climbing~ IMO.,1
3862,Reread my comment,1
3863,They are a waste of time for general climbing~ IMO,1
3864,Indeed - I misread that~ my bad.,1
3865,Not even close to the same functionality~ and I say that with considerable experience with both systems,1
3866,The Purcell has only half the range and is harder to adjust in all circumstances and especially hard-to-impossible to adjust if it is fully or partially weighted,1
3867,Whether the added range and light-years-better adjustability is worth the money is~ of course~ an individual decision,1
3868,You have light-years more experience than me~ so I'll defer to you on this one,1
3869,I really just wanted to throw out another option that folks I know use in lieu of the Petzl offering.,1
3870,So what about my suggestion of just using a rope with a clove~ or the long slyde?,1
3871,dindolino32~ I think using the rope is generally preferred if that is a reasonable option,1
3872,The OP doesn't explain what his use case is~ so gonna assume using the rope isn't an option or convenient (say while rappelling~ approaching a cliff from the top~ alpine climbing~ or say moving around on fixed lines),1
3873,For normal multi-pitch climbing with an easy descent (only a couple rappels) just using the rope is the way to go,1
3874,When I guided I would make clients take their PAS off unless we were gonna be rapping a lot,1
3875,I generally thought it was better to teach them how to use the rope,1
3876,I've got a Kong Slyde and tried it a fair bit~ but went back to the petzl connect as it was just a smoother device to use,1
3877,I think if you don't use a PAS/tether very often and price is more of a concern the Slyde is a good alternative,1
3878,I use it for work positioning as a third arm still,1
3879,What's your favorite red point rope? (Single pitch sport ) Sub 9.2 mm!,1
3880,Decathlon 8.9mm Dry Triple Norme,1
3881,Surprisingly endure for its diameter and price range,1
3882,Basically this is my the only do everything single rope since I bought it two years ago,1
3883,Had like gadzillion whips on it still had to cut its ends only twice.,1
3884,Went with BD 8.9 Ultra Pink,1
3885,Good price~ and it looks to be a sweet rope!,1
3886,Hi folks~ I was prompted to start this thread after following a discussion about a recent climbing fatality,1
3887,See the original thread here:mountainproject.com/forum/t… In the interest of providing a place to discuss helmets that is not co-mingled with this climber's accident and death~ I offer the following space,1
3888,We can go in any direction,1
3889,For example: 1-Do you were a helmet?  Always?  Sometimes?  How do you decide? 2-Do you think helmets should offer protection principally from falling objects (rocks~ gear~ and so on)~ or do you think helmets should also provide impact protection? 3-Regarding your answers to question two above~ do you think helmets are well-designed~ or could they be improved? 4-Are the protective benefits of wearing helmets exaggerated? Could there be cases where helmets increase the chances of serious injury (There are parallel debate for cycling and skiing helmets? 5-There's been a trend toward lighter-weight soft foam helmets; good or bad? 6-Should pros be encouraged to wear helmets more often~ as a way to increase the chances that others will?   OK~ that should be enough to get started...carry on,1
3890,B,1
3891,There have been several threads on this over the years~ but one more couldn't hoit!,1
3892,Helmet threads all the way down.,1
3893,Not sure how you did it~ but you linked this very thread instead of the original,1
3894,Actual link to accident thread: mountainproject.com/forum/t…,1
3895,Bruno~ As a friend of the original posts victim~ I really appreciate you relocating this to here,1
3896,Cheers.,1
3897,I'm a firm believer of wearing a helmet any time at the crag!! Better safe than sorry,1
3898,I've seen rocks fall from nowhere and if I hadn't been wearing a helmet on the Crestone traverse~ I could have been seriously injured when a baseball sized rock hit my head from a rock shower,1
3899,Thankfully~ I didn't look up or my face would have been hit badly!,1
3900,Bring back the Ecrin Roc!,1
3901,Wear em always from the moment I drop my pack to the hike out,1
3902,Pros should wear em,1
3903,yarp,1
3904,Thanks for the catch Theo--I edited the link,1
3905,I apologize for repeating a helmet thread...I hadn't seen one in while,1
3906,So~ risk is personal,1
3907,You cant make anyone adobt this behavior by force,1
3908,i have had a severe TBI from a fall at work,1
3909,I have had friends get broken off in a varity of ways,1
3910,Yes the helmet is a good tool,1
3911,Its one that i use,1
3912,I uselly have on with me sport climbing,1
3913,However~ the most risk is in the 1st 3 bolts~ just stick the 3rd bolt,1
3914,I do~ i have had people get pissy and mock me for it,1
3915,If i outweigh my belayer (i am about 180-190 depending on training volume and diet) I always stick up high enough that i dont worry,1
3916,That combined with an Ohm has made my smaller friends much happier,1
3917,It has helped me focus better,1
3918,The worst accidents i have seen were related to belayer error and device selection,1
3919,I saw a cinch defeated by the carabiner,1
3920,He  dropped the guy from the 8th/ 9th bolt? After taking over the scene~ lowering the paitient to the ground,1
3921,I cleared his spine and carried him out,1
3922,He broke his arm and chipped some vertebrae~  he nearly lost a finger,1
3923,He was really lucky,1
3924,I thought he was going to die based on how he landed and what he hit,1
3925,My good friend was dropped by an ATC pilot with an inattentive belayer and a poor carabiner interface,1
3926,11th bolt to the ground,1
3927,His whole TSpine pressure fractured,1
3928,I cant bealive that was it watching yhe video,1
3929,It was horrific,1
3930,Lesson to learn? Use a grigri to sport climb,1
3931,I dont give a fuck if you think what ever you have is just as good,1
3932,I have seen that it is not 1st hand,1
3933,It makes me very aware and anxious to see others using an atc/jul/smart/whatever to sport climb,1
3934,Its not my place to tell you what to do,1
3935,I do however~ asumme you are going to he dangerously incompetent untill proven otherwise,1
3936,I think any climbing helmet thay resembles a bike or skateboard helmet~ that could potentially meet the ASTM standards would be a step in the right direction,1
3937,I like my siccrco from petzl alot,1
3938,I even wear it sport climbing if i cant keep the rope out of my feet for a section,1
3939,I'm into helmets,1
3940,The only time i dont wear it is on legit redpoint burns when it's really hot out~ on sport climbs,1
3941,Otherwise~ if I'm onsighting~ or working a route~ or trad climbing~ I have it on,1
3942,Also 95% of the time I'm belaying~ it's on,1
3943,I think helmets with side protection are the only worthy contenders for a climbing helmet,1
3944,I really like the Petzl Boreo,1
3945,Very comfortable~ very light~ and some side and back protection,1
3946,I do wish more pro climbers would wear them in videos~ but I'd rather see them demonstrating better belay techniques,1
3947,The pros are great at inspiring some try hard~ but they rarely demonstrate good~ or great~ safety precautions that an average climber should be taking,1
3948,Is that their job? Maybe~ maybe not.,1
3949,Couldn't help thinking of helmets when I watched Ondra's Belly Full of Bad Berries https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ2GBjwf5CI&t=510s,1
3950,I really want some pro boulderer to start regularly wearing a helmet (didn't Sherman do this later on?),1
3951,Get on it~ Mellow crew!,1
3952,I'm interested in the answer to this question,1
3953,(Assuming~ of course~ that the helmets are properly fitted~ worn~ and manufactured.),1
3954,I wear my helmet for the vast majority of my trad climbing~ but will take it off for routes with squeeze/OW pitches or on routes where the falls are very safe/airy,1
3955,I am mostly concerned with hitting my head in a fall~ but the added protection from rockfall is useful as well,1
3956,I always wear a helmet when ice climbing,1
3957,I essentially never wear it for sport climbing,1
3958,I think helmets like the half done and helios are borderline useless,1
3959,Spend extra and get a helmet with back and side protection,1
3960,Yeah~ and I also wear my seatbelt.,1
3961,I don't wear a helmet,1
3962,But helmets are good,1
3963,Wear one if you want,1
3964,I paid a lot for what is in my head so if there is any chance of impact or something falling I'll always wear it,1
3965,Unless it is physically affecting my climbing I have never been bothered by having one on and think the benefits FAR outweigh the cost of having one extra piece of equipment you wear.,1
3966,I pretty much always wear one when leading~ often while belaying~ not usually on TR,1
3967,It would be nice if they protected against everything but not likely to happen,1
3968,Falling objects and impacts would be my priorities,1
3969,I recently got a new mountain bike helmet and was wondering if it is at least as good~ or maybe better~ for climbing than the climbing helmets,1
3970,I also wear a helmet skiing and see no reason not to,1
3971,It keeps my head warm~ and mostly cool~ better than hats~ mates up with my goggles nicely~ probably provides some protection~ and has speakers in it!,1
3972,Hey Bill I actually looked into this Bike vs Climbing helmet thing a bit when I was buy a helmet for my daughter (basically I was like wtf I don't want to buy two freakin helmets),1
3973,If I recall (?) the climbing helmets have better protection from objects falling from above than the bike helmets and bike helmets are better for side impacts,1
3974,They do make helmets for kids that are rated for both BUT I would not use a bike helmet as a climbing helmet..,1
3975,maybe the other way around though.,1
3976,I wear a helmet for 90% of my climbing (excluding bouldering),1
3977,Occasionally I forget to put it on~ or will decide to not wear it on a wide crack,1
3978,I pretty much always wear one sport climbing,1
3979,Ive seen too many falling rocks~ even at popular sport areas.,1
3980,With how light and low-profile modern helmets are~ there is absolutely no excuse for not wearing one~ at least while on the sharp end,1
3981,I wear one every time I'm leading anything,1
3982,It's just too easy to catch your foot on the rope or a draw or a ledge and flip~ and although most climbing helmets aren't perfect for side and rear impact~ it's better than nothing,1
3983,I also climb harder in a helmet--its a subtle signal to myself to get serious and try hard,1
3984,As far as wearing one on the ground for rockfall~ I do when the cliff seems unstable in some way,1
3985,Typically sport climbing in an area with good rock~ I don't,1
3986,Obviously risk is personal and I'll never give someone shit for not wearing a helmet while sport climbing~ although I'll talk to them about it if asked and explain why I wear one,1
3987,BUT! I think it's fucking bullshit when pros are photographed on the sharp end not wearing a helmet,1
3988,They make money off of the sport~ they're leaders in the sport~ and as such~ they have an obligation to set a good~ safe example,1
3989,If they are climbing on their own without photographers~ whatever~ that's their call,1
3990,But if you're hauling your photo crew out to snap some shots for the mags~ and you don't wear a helmet~ you're being a fucking selfish prick and the climbing media should collectively decide not to print that photo,1
3991,"I don't see the other side of that argument--if you're saying shit about climbing's ""rebel spirit"" and individuality~ that doesn't address the point that someone who makes money off the sport has an obligation to set a good example.",1
3992,I would never wear a climbing helmet on a bike,1
3993,My bike helmet is waaay thicker than my climbing helmet so should do more ti decelerate my head in a crash (the primary purpose of a bike helmet is for the foam structure to crush and allow you head a micro amount of additional time to decelerate drastically reducing g force so your brain smushes the inside of yours skull less hard) A parallel helmet question I have is MIPS?  My bike helmet has MIPS but it is bulkier than my old helmet without MIPS,1
3994,I just saw an add for a helmet (BD I think) in climbing mag with MIPS,1
3995,Do i really need the added weight and size for climbing? For those who don't know~ MIPS allows the shell of the helmet to rotate independent of your head in a crash (at least a little)  research showed that a lot of brain injuries in cycling came when you fell on your side while moving forward and your head gets jerked in a twist when it impacts,1
3996,(Or something this is from memory) Do we really have this kind of impact in climbing?  Personally didn't wear a helmet when i started climbing but now i do,1
3997,I do other helmet sports so it's easy for me to forget it's there~ I'm used to a helmet,1
3998,Also modern helmets are so nice and light,1
3999,And yes I do want it to protect me from impacts (not just falling rocks),1
4000,Zach~,1
4001,Mammut Wall rider is available with MIPS (I have one),1
4002,It only weighs 30g more than the non-MIPS version~ and doesn't add any noticeable bulk,1
4003,"It's basically a very thin web of plastic that provides isolation for the mounting points between the shell of the helmet and the ""harness"" that secures to your head.",1
4004,BD's video for their new Vision helmet has a cool explanation of MIPS~ and clearly shows the extra yellow MIPS layer,1
4005,(MIPS discussion starts at 2:44,1
4006,I can't get the link with start time to work.),1
4007,Found an awesome helmet,1
4008,It makes me look good,1
4009,So I always wear it,1
4010,A helmet saved my brain on a bike,1
4011,Under 10mph~ a tiny stick found my front brake pad~ 1/10~000 chance,1
4012,Helmet shattered~ did it's job,1
4013,over before i had a clue,1
4014,I'd ridden 5000 miles by then (not always with a helmet) and never known such a thing to occur before,1
4015,Never ridden without one since,1
4016,Have shared similar stories with other cyclists,1
4017,Climbing~ my helmet could protect me from falling cams~ falling water bottles~ falling rock~ falling ice~ falling eels~ falling backwards in aiders or upside-down after catching my leg on a ledge or the rope,1
4018,Life would be fucked without a sound mind,1
4019,And my helmet makes me look good.,1
4020,It will ALWAYS be better to have it on and to not need....Than to need it for your protection and wish you hadn't left it behind,1
4021,I'd be happy to show you what it looks like when you wish you had one on and did not,1
4022,I consider myself a helmet skeptic~ for exactly this reason: In other words~ people with helmets make riskier decisions that mitigate (some of) their benefits,1
4023,Despite my skepticism~ I always wear a helmet while trad climbing~ almost always when sport climbing~ never when bouldering~ and never in the gym,1
4024,There are too many little things that can go wrong that can have catastrophic consequences.,1
4025,Bold accent added by me,1
4026,Never may have been an inappropriate choice of words given the entirety of your post,1
4027,Unless pros~ and maybe all of those other people without an excuse~ aren't someones,1
4028,Because I think you just gave a bunch of shit.,1
4029,Always when leading~ almost always when belaying now too (we have a lot of choss here in Oregon)~ and usually~ even when TRing (which is kinda overkill~ but IMHO better to stick with a habit concerning safety for muscle memory purposes),1
4030,I also won't climb multipitch with anyone not wearing a helmet~ as the integrity of my partner's brain directly impacts my own safety,1
4031,:),1
4032,It's my vague impression from reading accident reports that there are more head injuries from falls than from falling rocks~ but I would be happy to be proven wrong with actual data,1
4033,I sort of feel like people talk more about the falling rocks because they don't like to admit that they could make a mistake that would result in a head injury from falling,1
4034,I wear a helmet essentially always when roped climbing~ and sometimes when bouldering,1
4035,I have never suggested that anyone else wear one~ and I think it is seriously lame to suggest that pros should do something to set an example for the rest of us,1
4036,If your choice to wear a helmet is greatly influence by what the pros do~ I'm inclined to think you should fix your decision making process in general before you worry about whether to wear a helmet,1
4037,There is a reason brands sponsor climbers (or any athletes for that matter),1
4038,What atheletes do and the gear they do it in influences consumer behavior,1
4039,That’s why brands pay them money to use their stuff,1
4040,People emulate the actions of individuals they admire,1
4041,It’s basic human nature.,1
4042," Avoided cracking my skull in a big slab fall because I had a helmet - I didn't usually wear one at that time~ but luckily a mentor had always said ""If you ever wear a helmet~ wear it leading slab.""  Got hit in the head with a couple small rocks - once in the Valley~ once in Owens",1
4043,Both times were no big deal with the helmet on~ but the Owens one left my ears ringing from the sharp sound! Whacked my belayer straight in the head with a not-tiny flake (maybe 5 pounds from 30 feet off the belay~ flung down since I was yarding on it)~ she had a helmet on~ she was fine,1
4044,Watched a friend break a similar sized rock and nail his belayer on the hand - missed his head by inches~ no helmet~ they were 500' up a wall and the rock fell around 50 feet,1
4045,Luckily the belayer heard the sound of the fall and grabbed the rope below the ATC with both hands~ since he wouldn't have been able to catch the fall otherwise (yet another argument for a Gri-Gri...),1
4046,A friend who's been doing new routes ground-up for 40 years and never wears a helmet managed to whack his head on a knob just while following me (sharp Tuolumne knob~ small roof)~ bled quite a bit~ almost needed stitches,1
4047,Still couldn't convince him to wear one~ but at least I got him to toss his crusty~ 30-year old harness - gave him one of mine under the condition that I watch him cut his old one up and toss it! OP questions - Always wear the helmet on lead (except tight squeeze chimneys)~ yes both impact and rockfall protection is needed~ always room for improvement in safety equipment~ protective benefits are NOT exaggerated~ can't think of a case where they'd increase injury chance (suppose you could strangle on it if you got really badly stuck in a squeeze chimney where you couldn't get your arms to the position to unclip it)~ light is great if they still perform~ pros can do what they want~ but manufacturers/retailers paying for the photos are also free to request that pros wear helmets in those photo shoots.,1
4048,Its been said that serious injuries would be substantially reduced if even mountain walkers wore helmets,1
4049,I think this came from a mountain rescue team,1
4050,I've definitely been saved from serious head injury twice: once in a direct head first fall onto rock~ and once in a very long fall/slide while returning from a snow climb (lucky I hadn't removed it),1
4051,In the first instance the coating from the crown of the helmet was splattered over the rock; the helmet was for climbing but had motorbike specifications~ good lateral protection and was very heavy by modern standards,1
4052,Second instance the helmet ended up with a small hole above the forehead~ I have no memory of the fall,1
4053,In both cases my neck hurt for a long time; I later found that I had a healed fracture of a cervical vertebra which was almost certainly related,1
4054,I've also often been struck by small rocks and ice,1
4055,I now wear a helmet almost anywhere that I might slip including on the walk in or scrambling,1
4056,If I've got a helmet in my pack it might just as well be on my head,1
4057,I don't wear one on small top rope crags~ even here a club member had a head injury from a tumble while coming back down so perhaps I'm illogical,1
4058,Presumably there are potential dangers: indoor walls ban them presumably due to risk of catching on bolts or being somehow dropped on other customers,1
4059,Its like car seat belts: a common reason given for not wearing them was that one could be burnt to death if they failed to release,1
4060,Doubtless that's happened somewhere~ but a tremendous number of serious injuries must have been prevented since belts became compulsory in the UK.,1
4061,Interesting,1
4062,I have never noticed them to be banned by gyms in the States,1
4063,I occasionally see people at my local gym who wear them.,1
4064,Yeah I can't imagine  a gym banning helmets,1
4065,The liability seems ridiculous,1
4066,"  One head injury and the person says ""well I wound have worn my helmet if you let me"" That being said while I always wear a helmet outside I dont want to on the gym",1
4067,I occasionally see people at my local gym who wear them,1
4068,Really? My gym requires climbers in the lead class to wear helmets,1
4069,I don’t see many other climbers outside of this class doing so though,1
4070,I know the outdoor gym in Chicago by the lake requires all climbers to wear them,1
4071,They even joke about it on their website.,1
4072,i climb with a helmet on...it is part of my kit i also try very hard not to climb with people above me...i will change my plans to avoid this i try to set belays in protected or out of the fall line areas...,1
4073,Really? My gym requires climbers in the lead class to wear helmets,1
4074,They even joke about it on their website,1
4075,Ah yes~ PG,1
4076,Those big ol red plastic buckets,1
4077,Each time I see that lead class I feel bad for the participants - not because of the goofy helmets made for rockfall (can't they give them actual helmets made for side/back impacts?) but because of how they teach falls.,1
4078,Yes~ really,1
4079,I'm confused by your question,1
4080,Really what?,1
4081,Sounds good! I think it would be a great idea!,1
4082,always,1
4083,I have a lot to loose and as an adult I am responsible for other people,1
4084,It's on 99% of the time,1
4085,The potential to mitigate a TBI is well worth the small weight penalty even sport climbing,1
4086,If the weight of a helmet is holding me back~ I just need to get stronger,1
4087,I'm not pushing the envelope of the sport so nothing I do is noteworthy outside of being better than my past self,1
4088,I don't boulder often but I'll use it if there's a good chance my head could meet a rock (higher fall~ bad landings~ etc).,1
4089,I remember reading about this topic in a 1950's copy of Summit Magazine,1
4090,Even with the crappy helmets back then they recommended you wear one,1
4091,Yes,1
4092,Also Yes,1
4093,Critical thinking,1
4094,Yes~ and yes,1
4095,having a bolt to clip right where you want doesn’t always make for a better fall,1
4096,Sorry~ I should have said sometimes banned,1
4097,There is an issue with wearing helmets when using autobelays as apparently there have been instances where helmets have become snagged,1
4098,I can't remember when I last saw anyone using a helmet indoors.,1
4099,"It's basically a very thin web of plastic that provides isolation for the mounting points between the shell of the helmet and the ""harness"" that secures to your head",1
4100,This is pretty cool,1
4101,I would have bought a MIPS helmet if I knew about it,1
4102,Are there any kids helmets with MIPS? I don't have kids~ but I would guess that even small adult helmets don't fit them~ and their brains are pretty important.,1
4103,I don't wear tape when crack climbing because chicks dig scars and I don't wear a helmet because chicks love vegetables!,1
4104,Petzl Boreo is plenty light~ and extremely comfortable~ and you dont have to replace it every year because it wont get dinged up like an all foam helmet,1
4105,I personally don't trust the ultralight foam helmets to protect against a major impact~ when you need it most.,1
4106," An ""interesting"" thread",1
4107,Lots of people talking to themselves (a typical internet phenomenon) and the real world not bothering to get involved,1
4108,I saw maybe 250 climbers in action over the weekend and not one was wearing a helmet~ buddy checks didn't exist and grigris where the device of choice.,1
4109,Condescending remarks seem to be a typical internet phenomenon~ as well,1
4110,Seems like theres quite a few people talking to each other on this thread~ and hopefully we'll talk to people in the real world about it at some point in our life,1
4111,Meanwhile~ in America~ I saw at least 5 people wearing a helmet on Sunday while climbing.,1
4112," I'm guessing the kind of person who would engage in a thread on this forum about helmets would tend to be someone who has a strong opinion about helmets~ therefore we get a bunch of people saying ""I always wear a helmet"" while 90% of sport climbers never bat an eye (or put on a helmet).",1
4113,I'm one of the people who rarely wears a helmet for 1-pitch sport climbing,1
4114,I also rarely wear it when toproping~ top-rope soloing~ bouldering~ soloing~ or belaying at the base of a crag,1
4115,I typically wear one for multipitch~ most 1-pitch trad climbs~ and mtn biking,1
4116,I know it would be safer for me to wear one all the time~ and I have not experienced my lightweight foam helmet adversely affecting my sending ability,1
4117,I've seen first-hand 2 partners who are alive probably because they were wearing helmets when they fell on a multipitch trad lead,1
4118," I'll genuinely try to look at this and question ""why do I choose to sometimes and not others?""",1
4119,I suppose I wear it primarily because I am more concerned about something getting dropped on me,1
4120," (When I'm belaying at a crag~ I'm under the illusion that I can stay out of the line of fire~ for the most part.)  It's nice to also have that extra level of safety when there is more likelihood for bigger falls (i.e.~ trad climbing-- especially during the first handful of years when you are still less reliably placing and trusting bomber gear-- although I feel more solid with gear now~ perhaps the habit of wearing one kind of remains for me~ even on a ""safe"" Creek hands splitter)",1
4121," Sport climbs~ by definition~ are intended to allow for ""safe"" falls and I still generally foolishly trust that-- despite having witnessed/experienced that some sport climbs are poorly bolted~ weird falls are always possible~ and that falling before or while clipping the 2nd or 3rd bolt could sometimes result in a ground fall.What would get me to wear one almost all the time? Sadly~ it would probably be either (a) seeing or experiencing something bad~ or (b) seeing a majority of climbing magazine photos/vids of (typically top-level) sport climbers wearing and advocating for them~ and the strongest climbers in my area wearing them",1
4122,I hate to argue with those of you who say you should always wear one (on this site or out at the crag)~ because I know that you are right and that my rationale is inconsistent,1
4123,Not to defend myself~ but it's worth noting that my risk tolerance may be a bit higher than it is for some (I do enjoy trad climbing~ and climbing in the mountains~ etc.)~ and I started at a time when helmets were less commonly used than they are now (~20 years ago),1
4124,Thanks for the posts~ reading these perspectives and about the accidents does cause me to reconsider and be more likely to wear a helmet more often~ without a doubt.,1
4125,Thanks George; super refreshing to hear a highly competent and strong climber admit this,1
4126,We like to think we aren't influenced by other climbers~ but we all are,1
4127,These two reasons are why I wear one,1
4128,I  saw some people wear one at the crag once~ I assumed they were gumbies~ and then they crushed very hard~ and I realized I needed to check my assumptions,1
4129,Then~ about a month later my wife took a HUGE surprise whip (clipping hold broke) that could have seriously fucked her up if she had had her leg behind the rope accidentally while casually clipping the chains,1
4130,Those two experiences together changed my habits.,1
4131,One time I was belaying and there was a climber on a route 15 or 20 feet to my right,1
4132,They pulled off a baseball sized rock that flew sideways right towards my head,1
4133,I was able to react enough to move my head but it did hit my right upper trapezius muscle,1
4134,It just bounced off and didn't even leave a bruise so I was pretty lucky,1
4135,I was not wearing a helmet and I still don't when belaying (unless the wall is very chossy~ but then why would I be climbing there?).,1
4136,I wear a helmet 100% of time outdoors on ropes climbing and belaying,1
4137,I come from a mountain biking background~ so its just natural,1
4138,I have to say that some rock climbing helmets are really ugly~ IMHO.,1
4139,I feel like I’m falling victim to some pervasive conspiracy promoted by “big helmet”....I only have one head~ never heard of~ or needed helmets as a kid growing up~ and yet now I have over a dozen helmets just for me (climbing~ biking~ whitewater~ snow sports~ parachuting~ motorcycle~ etc)  Add in my whole family~ and I need a separate garage for helmets alone,1
4140,Time to combine into one,1
4141,Probably based on a bike helmet.,1
4142,About 30 years ago I read an article in one of the climbing magazines about helmets and TBIs,1
4143,Up to that time I had not thought about a helmet for climbing but the article made sense to me so I went out to buy one,1
4144,None of the climbing helmets fit my head right but I found a kayaking helmet that was comfortable so I bought that,1
4145,Following weekend~ I went to the Valley with a partner,1
4146,Got to the base of the first route of the day and realized I had left the new helmet in the car,1
4147,Rationalized: “well~ I’ve already climbed 10 years without needing a helmet~ one more day won’t hurt”,1
4148,Ten minutes later I proceeded to take a 40 foot pretty clean fall that at some point flipped me front to back so that at the end of the fall the back of my head upper shoulder smacked against a protrusion on the face,1
4149,When my partner called up to ask if I was OK~ I thought my arm was broken because I couldn’t feel it or move it,1
4150,By the time he lowered me to the ground the feeling was coming back into my arm but I could tell I had hit my head hard,1
4151,It was bad enough I thought it might result in my dying,1
4152,The drive to the Valley Clinic~ Jack was asking me questions about who was president etc,1
4153,but alI I could do was say~ Jack~ please tell Michael how sorry I am and how much I love him,1
4154,Please tell my family I was thinking about them before I died,1
4155,Well I lived~ with a bad concussion and some nerve damage into my arm that took a while to resolve,1
4156,I’ve never forgotten the helmet again,1
4157,I personally feel like it’s an important piece of gear,1
4158,It has gotten whacked since then in various scenarios and replaced a couple of times,1
4159,I’m so used to wearing it that I’ll often forget to take it off for the hike out.,1
4160,I wear my helmet out at the end of the day probably 30% of the time,1
4161,One evening~ at the end of a day where I had been by myself all day~ in a relatively remote area~ I thoughtlessly put my helmet on~ and on the way out~ at the sketchiest part of the trail~ I raised up into a leg sized branch on a tree and absolutely pile drived myself,1
4162,It was so hard of an impact that I saw stars for a minute or so~ and I knew that if I'd been without my helmet on~ it would have knocked me out for sure,1
4163,The worst~ if I would have fallen down there~ there's a solid chance I would have died,1
4164,Moral of the story: dont leave giant limbs hanging over your trail that can knock you out! And wear your helmet out if there's difficult terrain still left.,1
4165,I seem to bonk my head like this a lot more often when I'm wearing the helmet,1
4166,I think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head.,1
4167,I think it obscures my peripheral vision above my head,1
4168,I suspect that has at least as much~ if not more~ to do with the “boundaries” of your head having suddenly changed...kinda like a kid stubbing their toe a bunch when they are growing.,1
4169,You're right,1
4170,There's a good chance I would have seen it without a helmet~ but I was insanely tired and who knows if I would have been paying attention more or not~ but ramming the top of my head during the step up would have been very bad,1
4171,Ultimately I just got lucky,1
4172,That branch~ not so lucky.,1
4173,"yeah me too~ but its probably proprioception~ I can't see my helmet in my ""peripheral"" or maybe the fact that your hair can act like a feeler to warn you before you bonk your head~ either way when I bonk my head with a helmet it doesn't hurt so no harm done~ rather have the occasional~ clunk oh yeah helmet than get hit in the head.",1
4174," yeah me too~ but its probably proprioception~ I can't see my helmet in my ""peripheral"" or maybe the fact that your hair can act like a feeler to warn you ",1
4175,I’m exact opposite,1
4176,My trouble now isn’t proprioception~ it’s priapism from past head injuries,1
4177,Need to rely on peripheral vision as my forward vision is blocked,1
4178,Can act like a feeler though ( to the alarm of other trail users),1
4179,I wear a helmet because why the fuck not? It’s pretty comfortable compared to head injury,1
4180,On one of my very first outdoor climbing experiences~ a fist sized rock missed my head by mere centimeters,1
4181,I wear a helmet on all roped climbs now,1
4182,The most memorable was when our group of four had just finished a climb and were packing up though we were still 20ft up on a scramble,1
4183,Everyone else had taken their helmets off aside from me and we joked and made a comment on how everyone else should still keep them on,1
4184,I shit you not~ ten seconds later~ I took a rock to my helmet,1
4185,A friend once made fun of me for wearing a helmet while snowboarding~ and that same day~ the motherfucker got a concussion from falling and slamming his head against ice,1
4186,He went home and bought a helmet,1
4187,Only got one head,1
4188,Gotta protect it lmaoo.,1
4189,Sounds like I need a trail running helmet..,1
4190,I have slammed head on into a branch like that while trail running,1
4191,left me flat on the ground and no memory of falling,1
4192,Scared my gf to death since we were way back in some remote mountains in SE AZ.,1
4193,I only dont wear a helmet on climbing days I am sure my wife will feed me oatmeal and wipe my ass for the rest of my days,1
4194,Pit a fucking lid.on!,1
4195,Just a couple of weeks ago a friend of friend (5.12 climber) slipped clipping the second bolt on a 5.9,1
4196,He fell upside down and landed on his head,1
4197,He wasn't wearing a helmet~ and is suffering from brain damage,1
4198,1- I always wear a helmet~ and feel naked if I don't,1
4199,Only time I take it off is to fit into some off-widths,1
4200,2- I think helmets should provide 360 impact protection,1
4201,3- I think they are well designed and getting better,1
4202,Mammut and BD now have MIPS technology,1
4203,I purchased the MIPS helmet~ and it fits like a dream,1
4204,4- I don't believe they are exaggerated,1
4205,The argument that they could worsen injuries just doesn't make sense to me,1
4206,5- No comment,1
4207,6- Absolutely not~ everyone should decide for themselves,1
4208,Can you imagine convincing Jeff Lowe that he always has to wear a helmet?,1
4209,Recent discussions on the forum have re-ignited my search for a tagline,1
4210,I've read through some old posts on the subject~ but would like to hear any suggestions anyone can offer regarding a screaming deal on a tagline right now,1
4211,6-8mm X 60-70m would be my target,1
4212,Thank you,1
4213,Hard to beat $89 for the BD 6mm static pull cord,1
4214,Plus whatever the current Active Junky cash back is from Backcountry or Steep and Cheap,1
4215,It's 65M,1
4216,Screaming deal,1
4217,Gracias Senor.,1
4218,Now as far as ultra-usefulness,1
4219,Any suggestions on a killer deal for a thin dynamic line in order to have it available to climb on in emergency situations?,1
4220,I've always been curious how necessary the extra 5 meters are for static taglines.,1
4221,I'm saying that I just want to be able to climb back up the small cord in an emergency situation,1
4222,Thusly the dynamic line.,1
4223,Are any 1/2 ropes rated for single rope use?,1
4224,There's triple rated ropes,1
4225,Given that you should always put the big dynamic line through an anchor plus the natural stretch of a dynamic line when rapping~ the extra 5 is just to be sure you don't rap off the end of your pull cord by accident,1
4226,Next time I use mine to rap I'll pay attention to how close the ends come to lining up as I near the bottom,1
4227,I believe it is in Mark Twight's book that it is mentioned that all half-ropes will withstand at least one UIAA test-fall with the 80kg weight~ but manufactures aren't allowed to make the claim,1
4228,(halfs are~ I believe~ tested and given a #-of-falls-rating with a 40kg weight),1
4229,Think about how a half rope is used: You leave the belay~ clip rope1 into protection 1~    then rope 2 into protection2~    then rope 1 into protection3 ...,1
4230,What if you fall before you clip protection#2???   Is UIAA really going to certify a rope that would break in this situation? Somehow I don't think so,1
4231," Twins~ of course~ are designed for both ropes to go into every protection point~ but have you seen a twin rope that isn't also ""half"" rated? Might be one or two out there somewhere",1
4232,"Does Edelrid make a belay device that is certified to work with said 6mm line?  That's a pretty small diameter~ most belay devices ""bottom out"" at around 7mm if I'm not mistaken.",1
4233,I prefer the cheapest 1/2~ twin~ etc rope - that way you can lead on it in extenuating circumstances,1
4234,Bought my 7.9mm line for under $90,1
4235,or if the 60m set goes on sale again: shop.epictv.com/en/ropes/be… that is the lightest two 60m rope setup,1
4236,My current Beal Joker + tagline weigh 12.3 lbs - the 7.3mm gully twins are 9.6 lbs for 60m (would require new belay devices~ though),1
4237,Have you looked into the Edelrid Rap Line II? It's rated for a fall although it's not dynamic,1
4238,Basically it acts like a screamer if you fall on it while trying to lead back up to free a stuck rope,1
4239,I haven't used it personally but that is the one that I will probably buy.,1
4240,Using any sort for half rope or non-static pull cord/haul line isn’t worth the added benefit especially with some semistatic products that are theoretically able to withstand one fall,1
4241,Pulling all of the stretch out of a dynamic lead line when hauling and/or rappelling is heinous and tiring,1
4242,I have a Sterling 6mm 60 meter static pull cord I will sell for $40 shipped,1
4243,I’ve used it like 4 times,1
4244,It’s red and originally marketed for canyoneering I recall,1
4245,In great shape,1
4246,Try out the system,1
4247,I liked it and upgraded to the Edelrid Rapline II.,1
4248,Does anyone have any recommendations for a good 1/2~ twin rope,1
4249,I grabbed an Edelrid Flycatcher some time ago and use it often for 5.easy..,1
4250,it’s 7.1~ 70m~ and will work in a dm pivot on guide mode,1
4251,Might weigh 5-6lbs? Feels like a 22oz beer in the hand~ so plenty light enough for those “just in case” routes and combines well w my 8.5 opera to tie on for dbl rope raps,1
4252,The Rap Line can be used with the Micro Jul~ but Edelrid makes and recommends the Mago 8,1
4253,It's a modified figure 8 with a built in stitch plate,1
4254,The Mago's are hard to come by in North America~ but they are available~ just ask your local shop to special order it for youedelrid.de/en/sports/descen…media.edelrid.de/images/att…,1
4255,I couldn’t find much info about this pack before I decided to ask Santa for it,1
4256,First impression is good,1
4257,It’s big and comfortable and everything goes in and out without much fuss,1
4258,The pics maybe don’t show it but there is room to spare on this 45L pack,1
4259,It comes with a basic rope tarp too,1
4260,It’s like carrying a Nokia clamshell phone on your back,1
4261,Like strapping a big clamshell made out of a casserole dish zipped onto a rectangular salad bowl that opens up into a nice love seat of climbing gear,1
4262,The bag is easy to use even when not fully splayed open,1
4263,Just carefully open the lips and explore what’s inside,1
4264,Water goes on the outside but could go on the inside,1
4265,There are no compression straps but I’m not sure if I’ll need them or not,1
4266,There’s a few external loops that a mesh could be made of shock cord if needed,1
4267,Seems perfect for a roomy trad crag bag,1
4268,But for hauling or multipitch~ caution will have to be taken not to unzip the pack too far,1
4269,I wanted a bag that was easy and this one is,1
4270,Fill it~ flip it~ zip it,1
4271,Hi are you still using this bag after a year? Just curious if There is anything you wish you could change about the bag if you could~ or any review update If you still use the pack~  thanks!,1
4272,Still fine,1
4273,Not getting as much use as I’d like but it’s held up fine,1
4274,I need to replace a spring in an offset alien that I have but can't seem to find any information on where/who would be suitable to perform the service,1
4275,"Plenty of trigger wire and sling threads but not much on ""other"" repairs",1
4276,Help?,1
4277,Did the spring wire break? Or just come free from the bent end that engages the groove in the axle?,1
4278,I think it came free from the bent end but I couldn't figure out what exactly had happened,1
4279,Depending on size and what it’s worth to you~ I likely have parts,1
4280,But between shipping both ways~ springs I’m loathe to part with as impossible to find (Original CCH springs are made from an unobtainium alloy)~ and an hour of my time~ you’re likely best off simply retiring it since original CCH are suspect anyway.,1
4281," In the ""Great Online Deals Thread~"" people are often asking for STP coupons",1
4282,While it's definitely helpful to share them~ it's not fun when you get a notification~ thinking it'll be a good deal~ and then realizing it's someone asking for a coupon code,1
4283,Anyway~ I thought it might be helpful to make a separate thread for people asking for or giving single-use coupon codes they aren't gonna use,1
4284,I hope this is the right forum section to post this in,1
4285,Hopefully this is useful for people.,1
4286,Thanks!!!,1
4287,I need another code :),1
4288,EMY18 Free shipping,1
4289,Anybody have a free shipping over $50 code?,1
4290,Hopefully this is useful for people,1
4291,Just as an FYI~ STP coupon codes aren't single-use.,1
4292," The fine print on the email codes say~ ""Limit 3 orders per email offer.""  They also expire in a day or two",1
4293,Yep~ like I said~ they aren't single use,1
4294,Whoops,1
4295,I haven't actually received one yet myself so I'd just assumed they were single-use from what I saw on the other thread,1
4296,I'll change the title to make it more accurate; thanks,1
4297,Edit: and since it's more closely related to this thread than the Great Online Deals thread: the AAC is having an online auction for some gear~ trips~ books~ etc,1
4298,It might be worth checking out,1
4299,As of writing this~ among the stuff that's available for immediate purchase is one Mountainsmith Scream 25 Backpack for $40 and 4 Ibex Women's Shak Lite Hoodies for $60 each,1

4309,Does anyone have another? A 20% off coupon would make a bipattern 60m rope under $100,1
4310,Just as an FYI~ the coupon codes don't work for everything,1
4311,If you are talking about the Edelrid Boa~ I haven't seen a recent coupon code that works for that rope (and I've been paying attention).,1
4312,Good to know coupons aren't good for everything!  I would be happy with a discount on shoes and shipping and $120 for the rope,1

4456,FWIW - I hadn’t received any coupon codes from STP for a while~ which was pretty unusual~ so I contacted their customer service via Live Chat on their website,1
4457,The rep was able to look up my account and saw that they had sent me a couple of codes recently~ even though I hadn’t received them,1
4458,They thought maybe my email spam blocker was blocking the emails~ which seemed unlikely to me~ but I went ahead and added their email addresses to my contacts list~ and am once again receiving DealFlyer coupons,1
4459,Go figure,1
4460,Also - they gave me the codes in the chat so I could use them to make my purchase right away,1
4461,Maybe this is happening to others too?,1

4478,Does STP mostly sell seconds? I used to buy from STP~ but most of items I get I would consider as seconds (small defects without impacting performance),1
4479,For example~ T-shirt seams would be a bit off,1
4480,Sleeves aren't even.,1
4481,Yep~ that’s how it works,1
4482,Some 2nds are better than others~ and virtually all are totally fine.,1
4483,I wouldn't say mostly seconds~ they sell a lot of past season gear or clearance items.,1
4484,Some 2nds are better than others~ and virtually all are totally fine,1
4485,I stopped buying from STP (4-5 years ago) because I didn't see any disclaimers stating it's seconds.,1
4486,I wouldn't say mostly seconds~ they sell a lot of past season gear or clearance items,1
4487,Are you sure? I know most if not all clothing items I received were what I would considered seconds,1
4488,I usually buy brands I already own~ so I can easily compare the quality,1
4489,This was 4-5 years ago before they got bought by TJMaxx.,1
4490,Are you sure? I know most if not all clothing items I received were what I would considered seconds,1
4491,This was 4-5 years ago before they got bought by TJMaxx,1
4492,Yes~ but that is simply my experience~ I don't doubt that they do sell some seconds~ I just think saying that most of their inventory is seconds is not accurate,1
4493,It is pretty easy see that a lot of their inventory comes in after items are discontinued,1
4494,Your argument that they do not specifically call out items that are seconds can cause concern for some~ but for me this is a non-issue.,1

4747," Have you guys found that activejunky is no longer giving cashback for Sierra when you use a coupon? They state they wont in the detailed information ""even when using an approved coupon from Sierra"" and I just found that I got no cashback from them after ordering something twice (cancelling the first order just to try to get cashback again)",1

4749,Ask ActiveJunky customer service about it,1
4750,I've had it happen to me occasionally~ but most of the time I get the cashback including my most recent purchase,1
4751,I've spoken with their customer support and they will point to use of the coupon as why it didn't qualify for cashback even when I have gotten the cashback many times before while using their coupons.,1

4952,POTENTIALLY HELPFUL INFO FOR OTHERS WHO WANT SIERRA CODES: I was on the promo email list for years~ but stopped receiving them over a year ago,1
4953,I just called customer service and the rep said that if you go >6 months without shopping at Sierra they discontinue your discount code emails,1
4954,"I explained that I had been out of the country for awhile~ so she verified my zip code~ last name~ and email~ then messaged tech support with a ""request to reinstate promotional emails""",1
4955,She said that tech support usually honors those requests~ but it takes 2-3 weeks to be reinstated.,1
4956,Free shipping: HP43EB625 HP68HW742  I tried a chat with customer service to try to get on the secret email list~ but no luck,1
4957,"As it is I just get their ""new arrivals"" etc promotional emails",1
4958,Too bad there doesn't seem to be a way to sign up any more.,1
4959,I think it's been a cluster since Sierra was acquired by TJ Maxx,1
4960,I called customer service with the same request about a year ago and was told that promo code emails weren't going out anymore,1
4961,The most recent rep said that they're still around but could be discontinued in the near future,1
4962,She definitely verified that I was a long-time customer who used to be on that discount code email list,1
4963,If tech support approves my request I'll be sure to hop on here and share from time to time,1
